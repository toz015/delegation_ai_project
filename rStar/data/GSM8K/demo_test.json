She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
        "solution": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18"

        "solution": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3"

        "problem": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",
        "solution": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000"
