Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Add the number of chocolates Leah and her sister had initially. Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42 chocolates. So, they had 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates in total.\nStep 2: Subtract the number of chocolates they ate from the total number of chocolates they had. They ate 35 chocolates.

The problem states Jason had 20 lollipops.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of lollipops. The problem states Jason now has 12 lollipops.\nStep 3: Subtract the final number of lollipops from the initial number to find out how many lollipops Jason gave to Denny.\nStep 4: Therefore, Jason gave Denny 20 (initial number of lollipops) - 12 (final number of lollipops) = 8 lollipops.\nStep 5: The answer is 8.\n\n### Instruction:\nJosh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Calculate the original value of the house.\nJosh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. So, the original value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\nStep 2: Calculate the increase in value.\nThe value of the house after repairs is $130,000 * 150% = $195,000.\nStep 3: Calculate the profit Josh made by flipping the house.\nThe total increase in value is $195,000 + $100,000 = $295,000.\nStep 4: Calculate the profit Josh made by flipping the house.\nThe profit Josh made is the total increase in value minus the initial value of the house. So, the profit is $295,000 - $130,000 = $165,000.\nStep 5: Provide the answer.\nJosh made a profit of $165,000.\n\n### Instruction:\nTara is 5 years older than Evan and twice"}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.
