At the final step, a conclusive answer is given in the format of \"The answer is: <ANSWER>.\", where <ANSWER> should be a numeric answer.\n\n### Instruction:\nThere are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.

How many bolts in total does it take?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Determine how many bolts of blue fiber are in the robe.\nThe statement says that 2 bolts of blue fiber are taken for every bolt of fiber used. So, for the robe, it would take 2/2 = 1 bolt of blue fiber.\n\nStep 2: Determine how many bolts of white fiber are in the robe.\nThe statement also says that 1 bolt of white fiber is taken for every bolt of fiber used. So, for the robe, it would take 1/2 = 0.5 bolts of white fiber.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of bolts in the robe.\nSince the robe takes 1 bolt of blue fiber and 0.5 bolts of white fiber, the total number of bolts in the robe is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 bolts.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of bolts in the robe.\nThe robe takes 1.5 bolts in total.\n\nStep 5: The answer is 1.5 bolts.\n\n### Instruction:\nThere are 63 trees in the forest.
