Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.

After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel.
