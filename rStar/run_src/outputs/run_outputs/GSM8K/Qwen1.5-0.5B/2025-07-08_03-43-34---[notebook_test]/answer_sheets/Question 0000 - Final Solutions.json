Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.

The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 2: On a moonless night, three fireflies danced in the evening breeze. They were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies before two of the fireflies flew away. How many fireflies remained?\nQuestion 2.1: How many fireflies joined?\nAnswer 2.1: The fireflies were joined by four less than a dozen more fireflies, which are 12 - 4 = 8 fireflies. The answer is 8.\nQuestion 2.2: Now we can answer the question: How many fireflies remained?\nAnswer 2.2: Three fireflies were dancing originally. They were joined by 8 fireflies before two of them flew away. So there were 3 + 8 - 2 = 9 remaining. The answer is 9.\n\nQuestion 3: Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills that he saved after working for Mr. James on his farm. Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.\nQuestion 3.1: How much money does Ali have after giving half of his total money to his sister?\nAnswer 3.1: Ali initially has four $10 bills and six $20 bills, totaling 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 160 dollars. Giving half of this to his sister leaves him with 160 / 2 = 80 dollars. The answer is 80.\nQuestion 3.2: How much money does Ali spend on dinner?\nAnswer 3.2: Ali uses 3/5 of his remaining money, which is 80 dollars, to buy dinner. Therefore, he spends 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars on dinner. The answer is 48.\nQuestion 3.3: Now we can answer the question: How much money does Ali have after buying the dinner?\nAnswer 3.3: After buying the dinner, Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left. The answer is 32.\n\nQuestion 4: A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel. If the car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring, how far did it have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nQuestion 4.1: How far did the car travel except for the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.1: It travels 5 meters after the 1st, 8 meters after the 2nd, and 0 meters after the 4th turn. It's a total of 5 + 8 + 0 = 13 meters. The answer is 13.\nQuestion 4.2: Now we can answer the question: How far did the car have to travel after the 3rd turn?\nAnswer 4.2: The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. It travels 13 meters except for the 3rd turn. So it has to travel 23 - 13 = 10 meters after the 3rd turn. The answer is 10.\n\nQuestion 5: Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

She then bakes muffins with four eggs per day, which is 4 eggs. This totals to 16 eggs in a day. She sells these fresh eggs at the farmers' market, which is 16 - 4 = 12 eggs per day. Therefore, she makes 12 * $2 = $24 every day at the farmers' market. The answer is 24.\n\nQuestion 6: A company wants to improve their\nAnswer 5.1: A company wants to improve their sales in order to increase their profits.

The person can buy 100 pounds of sugar at a price of $2 per pound. How many pounds of sugar does the person need to buy to have enough sugar for all the other products in the house?\nAnswer 7.1: The person can buy 100 pounds of sugar at a price of $2 per pound.

The assistant gives step-by-step solutions to the user's questions. At the final step, a conclusive answer is given in the format of \"The answer is: <ANSWER>.\", where <ANSWER> should be a numeric answer.\n\n### Instruction:\nThere are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.
