Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.

Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Identify the initial number of trees. The problem states there are 15 trees in the grove.\nStep 2: Identify the final number of trees. The problem states there will be 21 trees after the workers are done planting.\nStep 3: Subtract the initial number of trees from the final number of trees to find out how many trees were planted.\nStep 4: Therefore, the grove workers planted 21 (final number of trees) - 15 (initial number of trees) = 6 trees today.\nStep 5: The answer is 6.\n\n### Instruction:\nIf there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n\n### Response:\nLet's think step by step.\nStep 1: Start with the number of cars that are already in the parking lot, which is 3 cars.\nStep 2: Add the number of cars that arrive, which is 2 cars.\nStep 3: Add the numbers together. there are 3 cars + 2 cars = 5 cars in the parking lot.\nStep 4: The answer is 5.\n\n### Instruction:\nLeah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42.
