Express your answer as a common fraction.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "We are asked to solve $4^x=8$ for $x$.  Writing $4$ as $2^2$ and $8$ as $2^3$, the equation becomes $(2^2)^x=2^3$.  The left-hand side simplifies to $2^{2x}$, so we may set exponents equal to find $2x=3$, which implies $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.", "gold_answer": "\\frac{3}{2}"}
