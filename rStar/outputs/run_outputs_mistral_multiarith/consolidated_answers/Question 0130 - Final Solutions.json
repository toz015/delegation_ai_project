According to condition 1, Dave needs to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 27 long sleeve shirts, making a total of 9 + 27 = 36 shirts. But condition 2 tells us he managed to wash only 20 shirts in total. Therefore, the difference between the total number of shirts he needed to wash and the number of shirts he actually managed to wash is 36 - 20 = 16. Since all those missing shirts are long sleeve shirts, no short sleeves were missed. Hence, Dave did not fail to wash any short sleeve shirts before school. However, he did fail to wash 16 long sleeve shirts. The answer is: 16.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
