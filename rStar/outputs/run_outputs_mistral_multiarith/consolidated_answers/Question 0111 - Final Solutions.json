We need to find out how many cups she still needs for the remaining 2 brownies.\n\nLet's think step by step. Isabel starts with 3 brownies and therefore has 3 * 5 = 15 cups of flour for them. Since she needs a total of 5 brownies for her party, she needs an additional 5 - 3 = 2 brownies. These 2 brownies require 2 * 5 = 10 cups of flour. 15 (already used) + 10 (still needed) = 25 cups of flour.
