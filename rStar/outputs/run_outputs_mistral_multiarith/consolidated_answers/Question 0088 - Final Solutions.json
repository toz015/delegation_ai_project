Each shelf holds 6 books, except for the 2 shelves for mystery books which don't count towards this calculation. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of shelves for normal books (non-mystery) by dividing the total number of books by the number of books per shelf (excluding mystery shelves). Since Nancy owns 6 shelves for picture books, she has a total of 12 shelves. The number of shelves for non-picture books is 12 - 6 = 6 shelves. Thus, Nancy has 6 shelves * 6 books/shelf = 36 books for non-picture books. She also has 2 shelves for mystery books, so she has 36 books + 2 shelves * unknown_number_of_books = Total number of books. We don't have information about the number of books on mystery shelves, but the total number of books can be calculated as 36 books + 2(unknown_number_of_books), where unknown_number_of_books represents the number of books on mystery shelves.
