We know that the waiter had 22 customers in total. Dividing the total number of customers (22) by the number of customers per table (4), we can find the number of tables (22/4=5.5). However, since there cannot be a fractional number of tables, this result indicates that there is one extra customer or one fewer table than there should be.

Given condition 1, we know there were 22 customers in all. Each table, besides the last one, had 4 customers (condition 2). Let's find out how many tables there are before the last one. We can calculate this as follows: numberOfTables = (totalCustomers - lastTableCustomers) / customersPerTable, where totalCustomers = 22, lastTableCustomers = 0 (for simplicity), and customersPerTable = 4. So, the numberOfTables = (22 - 0) / 4 = 5.5. However, since the number of tables cannot be a fraction, there must be one extra table for the last group with less than 4 customers. Therefore, there are 5 full tables, which means there are 5*4=20 customers at those tables. Since there are only 20 customers among them, the last table has no empty seats, i.e., it also has 4 customers. Thus, the waiter manages 5+1=6 tables.
