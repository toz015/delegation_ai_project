The result would then represent the number of full groups. However, if the rounded down result is equal to the original total divided by the group size (excluding the last decimal digit), there will be one additional group that can be formed.\n\nIn this scenario, we have 72 students in total. We want to divide them into groups of 9. First, calculate the quotient: 72 / 9 = 8. Since the quotient doesn't equal the total number of students divided by the group size, the answer is simply the quotient: 8.\n\nHowever, let's check if there is an extra group that can be formed. To find that out, subtract the product of the group size and the quotient from the total number of students: 9 * 8 = 72. Since the difference is zero, there is indeed an extra group.
