According to condition 1, Oliver starts with $33. From condition 2 we know that he spends $4. But since this spending event is not mentioned as happening before or after any other events, it could technically be before or after the receipt of money from his mother according to the information provided. However, the second part of condition 3 says that he receives an additional $32 from his mother, so if we assume that this happens after he spent the $4, then the total amount Oliver has by March would be $33 (initial) + $32 (received later) = $65. But if the spending of $4 happened before receiving the $32, then Oliver would have $33 (initial) - $4 (spent) + $32 (received later) = $61.
