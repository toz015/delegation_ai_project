We know that on Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags, and each bag held 9 cans. To find out how many cans were in one bag on Saturday, we simply multiply the number of bags by the number of cans per bag. 3 bags * 9 cans = 27 cans. But this isn't the direct answer to the question, so let me rephrase it. The answer is: Each bag on Saturday held 27/3 = 9 cans. The answer is: 9.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many bags did Sam fill on Sunday?", "subanswer": {"text": "Sam filled 4 more bags on Sunday compared to Saturday, so he filled 3 bags on Saturday and 7 bags in total.
