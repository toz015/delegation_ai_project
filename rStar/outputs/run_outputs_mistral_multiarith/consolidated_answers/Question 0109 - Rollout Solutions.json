Hint 1: Shelves for mystery books = Total number of mystery books / 8 => 5 * 8 = 40 shelves needed.

This means 35/8 = 4.375 shelves are required for just mystery books. Since she can't have a fractional number of shelves, she needs to add one more shelf for the remaining 3 mystery books. So the actual number of mystery books is 35 + 3 = 38.\n\nHint 2: We know now that Bianca had 38 mystery books. Based on the information provided, she also had 4 shelves for picture books.
