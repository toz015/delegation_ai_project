First, we want to know the number of ways 8 people can be seated around a square table.

We know that there are 8 ways to seat 2 people, so there must be 8 ways to seat 8 people. To get the number of ways to seat 8 people, we multiply 2 times 8. So, there are 16 ways to seat 8 people. We can think of this as $16$ overlapping $2$ in a rectangle. Therefore, to seat 8 people around a square table, we can seat them in $16$ ways. There are $4$ people remaining, so we can seat them in 2 ways: either they sit on the side of the table and the other 2 sit on the opposite side, or they sit diagonally and the other 2 sit on the opposite diagonal.
