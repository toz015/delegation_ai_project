We know the length of the field is 300 feet. We also know that the width of the field is 400 feet. So, we can set up an equation for the distance between their locations: $d = (400,300) + 2T$. Then, we can solve for $d$. Since Jim walks diagonally, we can write $d$ in terms of $t$. We know that $d = 2t$ if we walk along the length of the field and $d = -2t$ if we walk along its width. Since Jim walks diagonally, we can write $d = -2t$ and solve for $d$. We get: $d = (-2,100) + 2T$. Since $T$ is 300 units long and $2T$ is 600 units long, we can solve for $d$ by setting $d = -200$.
