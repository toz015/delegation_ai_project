Given that $n$ is a rational number and that $n$ is the number of miles per gallon, we can use the formula $n = \\boxed{p\\cdot q}$ to convert the condition into a proportionality between $n$ and $p$ and $q$. For example, $n = \\boxed{2\\cdot 3}$. Therefore, we have the condition $n = \\boxed{2\\cdot 3}$. Now, we can use the fact that $3$ is the number of miles per gallon to write $n = \\boxed{3\\cdot 2}$. Therefore, $n = \\boxed{6}$.
