First, we consider a television that costs $1500. If Daniel's claim is true, then it is likely that the television has a lower number of sales than $15*1500. If this is the case, then it is reasonable to assume that the television has a lower cost than $1500. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the television's cost is proportional to the number of sales. The higher the television's cost, the fewer sales it will have. So, if we assume that the television's cost is proportional to its number of sales, then we can use Daniel's claim that a television with a cost of $2500 will have $\\boxed{15*2500}$ sales.
