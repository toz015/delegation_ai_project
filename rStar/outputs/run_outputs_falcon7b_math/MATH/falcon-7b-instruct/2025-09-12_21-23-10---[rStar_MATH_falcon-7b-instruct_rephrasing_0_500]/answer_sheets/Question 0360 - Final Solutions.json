The conditions are: $n = 2^8$, $n = 1$, $n = 2^4x = 8$, and $n = 1$. We can use the fact that $n = (n-1)/2$ to simplify the expressions. For the first condition, $n = 8$ satisfies. For the second condition, $n = 8$ satisfies. For the third condition, $n = 1$ satisfies. For the fourth condition, $n = 1$ satisfies. Therefore, $n = 1$. For the fifth condition, $n = 8$ satisfies. For the sixth condition, $n = 8$ satisfies. So, the conditions are met. Therefore, the answer is 1.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
