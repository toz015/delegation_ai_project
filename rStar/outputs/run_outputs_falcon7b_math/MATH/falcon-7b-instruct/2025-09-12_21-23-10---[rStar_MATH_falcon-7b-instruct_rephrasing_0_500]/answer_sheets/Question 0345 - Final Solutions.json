To find the value of $x$ in the given equation, we can solve each of the conditions one by one. First, we'll solve for $x$. Then we'll use the solutions to solve for $x$ again and so on. In the given equation, $x = y$ and $x = -4$. To solve for $x$ in these two cases, we can substitute the value of $y$ into the equation and solve for $x$. For $x = y$, we get $x = -2$. To solve for $x$ in the other case, we substitute $y = -4$. Then we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula: $x = (-2 \u00b1 sqrt(-16-4))/4 = -1 \u00b1 1$.
