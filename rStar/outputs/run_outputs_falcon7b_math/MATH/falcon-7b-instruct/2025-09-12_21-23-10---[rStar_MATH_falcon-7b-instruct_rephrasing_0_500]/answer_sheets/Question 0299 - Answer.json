How many integer coordinates will be strictly inside the rectangular region?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Points with integer coordinates are called lattice points. The length of the rectangle is $5 - (-5) = 10$ units. There will be 9 lattice positions between the two vertical sides of the rectangle. The height of the rectangle is $4 - (-4) = 8$ units. There will be 7 lattice positions between the top and bottom of the rectangle. That's a total of $9 \\times 7 = \\boxed{63}$ lattice points.", "gold_answer": "63"}
