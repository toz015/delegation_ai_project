First, note that the exponent $2^{235423523}$ is extremely large. We can use a calculator or computer program to evaluate the expression and calculate the result. In this case, we can use logarithms to simplify the expression. The base of the logarithm is set to be 1. So, the expression becomes $\\log_{1}(2^{235423523})$. We can expand $\\log_{1}(2^{235423523})$ and simplify to $(2^{235423523}-1)/2^{235423523}$. This simplifies to $(2^{235423523}-1)/2^{235423523}$.
