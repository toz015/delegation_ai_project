Since $x^2 + $x+2 - 6 = 1$, it means that $x$ is an integer between 1 and (n - 1). So, we can write $x = (n-1)/2$ or $x = (n-1)/2 + 1$. Since $n$ is a positive integer and $n-1$ is also a positive integer, we can write $n$ as a fraction of $n-1$. Therefore, $n$ can be written as $(n-1)/2$, so the value of $x$ is $(n-1)/2$.
