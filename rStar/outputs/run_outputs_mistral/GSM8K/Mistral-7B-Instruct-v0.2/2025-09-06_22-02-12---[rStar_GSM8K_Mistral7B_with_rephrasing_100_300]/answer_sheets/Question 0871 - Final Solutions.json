We know that Tobias consumes a fraction equal to 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day, so the missing piece was 14 * (7/13). The answer is 48 + 10 + 14 * (7/13), or approximately 69.21 pieces of pizza. Note that since the answer is not an integer, it can't be expressed exactly as the number of pizza pieces.
