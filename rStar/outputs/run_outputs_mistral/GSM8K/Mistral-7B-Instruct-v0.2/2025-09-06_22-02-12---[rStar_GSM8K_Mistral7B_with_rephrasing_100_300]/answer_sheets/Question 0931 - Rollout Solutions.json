According to the third condition, Peter's age (P) equals the sum of Paul's (x+10) and John's (x) ages. So we can write down the equation P=x+10+x. Simplifying it, we get P=2x+10. Since we know that the collective age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, then P+Paul's+John's age=100.

Since the combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years, and their ages form an arithmetic progression where the difference between their ages is constant (10), we can find Peter's age using the formula: Peter's age = 2 * (Paul's age + Jean's age) / 3. We know that Paul's age is Paul's age - 10 = x, and Jean's age is x - 10. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: Peter's age = 2 * ((x + (x - 10)) / 3).
