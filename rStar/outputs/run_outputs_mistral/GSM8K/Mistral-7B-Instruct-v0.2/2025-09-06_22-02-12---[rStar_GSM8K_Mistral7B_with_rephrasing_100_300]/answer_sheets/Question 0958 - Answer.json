{"id": 958, "problem": "Courtney attended a concert and reported that the audience was 48 in number. However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number of people in attendance by 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number\nTherefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40\n#### 40", "gold_answer": "40"}
