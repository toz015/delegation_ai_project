Since this percentage represents half of its daily flights, we can say that one quarter of its daily flights go to Greece (75%) and three quarters go elsewhere (25%). Since 2 planes operate daily, the first one makes 2 flights/day for Greece, and the rest must be divided equally between France and Germany. Let's assume x is the number of daily flights to France or Germany. We know that 2 + 2x = 2(1+q), where q is the fraction of daily flights going to France or Germany. Solving for x, we get x=(1+q)/(1-q). Given that q=1/4, we have x=5. The first plane makes 5 flights daily.
