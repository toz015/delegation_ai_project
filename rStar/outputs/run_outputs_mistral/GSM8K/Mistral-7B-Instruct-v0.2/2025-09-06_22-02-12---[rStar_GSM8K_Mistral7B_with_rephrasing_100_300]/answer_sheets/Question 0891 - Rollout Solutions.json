According to condition 1, a whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of a thingamabob. But we don't know how fast a thingamabob spins. However, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second (condition 3). Since a whatchamacallit spins at 11 times the speed of a thingamabob (condition 2), a thingamabob must spin at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second. Given that a whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of a thingamabob, it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second.
