The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as often as Joe's, so she made 30 dollars from that (5x6). Thus she made 18 + 30 = 48 dollars from the lawn mowing. Since her total earnings were 80, this means she made 80 - 48 = 32 dollars from lemonade sales.

The first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Since Joe paid Tasha $6, we can represent the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as 6. The number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn would be 3 * 6 = 18. Therefore, the revenue she made from mowing Kamala's lawn was $18.\n\nNext week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, meaning she mowed it 5 * 6 = 30 times. This equates to $30 in revenue.\n\nTo find the revenue generated from lemonade sales, we need to subtract the revenue from lawn mowing from the total earnings: $80 - $18 - $30 = $32.
