Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks\nThen multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks\nThen find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks\nThen add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks\n#### 135", "gold_answer": "135"}
