During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees, but it drops to 12 degrees at night. To maintain a temperature of 32 degrees or above during the night, we need to determine how many logs it takes to heat the house up 12 degrees from its nighttime temperature. Since one log raises the temperature by 5 degrees, we divide the amount needed by the heat output of each log: 12 / 5 = 2.4. Since we cannot burn a fraction of a log, we round up to 3 logs to ensure the house stays warm enough.\n\nThe answer is: 3 logs.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
