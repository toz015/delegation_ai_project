Ellen eats a salad, which costs $6. Her yogurt costs $3, which is half the price of the salad. Ellen eats 2 carrots, 1 salad, and 1 yogurt daily. Since we're looking for the cost of one carrot, we first find out her total spending is $11, then subtract the costs of the other two items to get the cost of one carrot. $11 (total cost) - ($6 (salad cost) + $3 (yogurt cost)) = $11 - $9 = $2.
