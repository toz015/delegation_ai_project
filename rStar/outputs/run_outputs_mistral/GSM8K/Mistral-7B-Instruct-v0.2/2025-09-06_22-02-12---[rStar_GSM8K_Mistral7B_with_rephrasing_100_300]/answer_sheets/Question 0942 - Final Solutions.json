For visiting the house, Patty charges a flat fee of $40. This doesn't change depending on the length of the visit or the cost of the parts. That is the first part of the answer.\n\nNow let's calculate the labor fee. We know that one job took 2.25 hours and the labor charge was $78.75. To find out the hourly labor rate we divide the labor fee by the hours worked: labor_rate = labor_fee / hours_worked => 78.75 / 2.25 = 35.
