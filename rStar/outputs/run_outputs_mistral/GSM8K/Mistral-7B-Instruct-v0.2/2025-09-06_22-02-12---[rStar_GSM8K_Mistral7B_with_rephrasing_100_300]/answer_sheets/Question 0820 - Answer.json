{"id": 820, "problem": "Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on a particular day. She also walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, to Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.\nThe total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8+4 =<<8+4=12>>12 hours.\nSince 1 hour has 60 minutes, Sandy walked for 12*60 = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes in the two days.\n#### 720", "gold_answer": "720"}
