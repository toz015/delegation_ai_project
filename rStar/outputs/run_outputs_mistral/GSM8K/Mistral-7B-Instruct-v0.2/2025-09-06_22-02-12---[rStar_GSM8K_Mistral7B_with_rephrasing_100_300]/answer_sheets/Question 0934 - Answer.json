{"id": 934, "problem": "Zoey and Sydney are having a watermelon seed spitting contest. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400\nSydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420\nThis totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820\nThe average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410\n#### 410", "gold_answer": "410"}
