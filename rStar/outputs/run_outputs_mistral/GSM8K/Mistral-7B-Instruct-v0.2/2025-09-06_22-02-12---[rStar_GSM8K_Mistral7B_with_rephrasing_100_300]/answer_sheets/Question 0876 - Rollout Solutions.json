Long-answer questions are worth 5 points each, so the total points earned from them is 60% of LA points.\n\nWe know that the total number of points is equal to the sum of points from each type of question. But we don't have enough information to calculate the exact values of MC, TF, and LA. However, we can find out the total points earned from the multiple-choice questions if we assume that there is only one long-answer question.\n\nSince long-answer questions are worth 5 points each, and Amy gets 60% of those points, having only one long-answer question means", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "If Amy gets 1 point per long-answer question, how many long-answer questions are there?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since the points from one long-answer question are equivalent to 5 * 60% = 3 points from multiple-choice questions, and she earns 80 points in total from multiple-choice questions, then there should be 80 / 3 = 26.67 \u2248 27 multiple-choice questions.
