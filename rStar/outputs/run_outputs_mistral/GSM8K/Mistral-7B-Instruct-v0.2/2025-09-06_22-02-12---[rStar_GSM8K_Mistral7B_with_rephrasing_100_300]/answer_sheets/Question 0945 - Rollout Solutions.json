It takes him 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.\n\nSo the total time taken is 6 hours (swimming first part) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (swimming second part) = 17 hours.\n\nThe answer is: 17 hours.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 18}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.
