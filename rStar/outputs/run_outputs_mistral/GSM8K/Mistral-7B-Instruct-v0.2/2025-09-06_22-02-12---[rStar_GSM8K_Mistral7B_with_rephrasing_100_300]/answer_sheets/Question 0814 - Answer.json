Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How much money is used?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour\nSo he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour\nHis two friends add change 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 times an hour\nSo they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour\nHis last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour\nSo he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour\nSo in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour\nSo they spend 2.75*4=$<<2.75*4=11>>11 in the 4 hours\n#### 11", "gold_answer": "11"}
