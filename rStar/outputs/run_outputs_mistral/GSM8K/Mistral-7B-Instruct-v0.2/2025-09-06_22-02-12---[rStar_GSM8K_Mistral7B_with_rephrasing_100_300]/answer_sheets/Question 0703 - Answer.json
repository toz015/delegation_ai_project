{"id": 703, "problem": "Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends.  There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females among them. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. How many dumplings did Larry cook if each female ate 3 dumplings and there were no leftovers?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.\nHence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.\nThe 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.\nSo, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
