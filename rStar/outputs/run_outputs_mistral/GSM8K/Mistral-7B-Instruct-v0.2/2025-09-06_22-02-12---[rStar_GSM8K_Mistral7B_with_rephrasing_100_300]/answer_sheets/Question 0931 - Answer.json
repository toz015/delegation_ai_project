{"id": 931, "problem": "The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Paul is 10 years older than John and that Peter\u2019s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x be the age of John. Paul\u2019s age is x + 10\nPeter\u2019s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10\nWe have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100\nCombining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100\nSubtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.\nJohn is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
