{"id": 787, "problem": "Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.\nHe was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.\nSo, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.\nTherefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.\n#### 25", "gold_answer": "25"}
