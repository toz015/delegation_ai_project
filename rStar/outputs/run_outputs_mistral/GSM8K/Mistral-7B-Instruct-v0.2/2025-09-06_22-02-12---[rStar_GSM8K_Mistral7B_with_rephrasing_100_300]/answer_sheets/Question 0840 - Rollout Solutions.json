We know the length of the first and the second glue sticks that are left. To find the length of the third glue stick, we subtract those lengths from the total length of the three glue sticks. Each glue stick is 6 inches long. So, if one glue stick is 1/6 long, it has 1 inch left (since 1 inch is equal to 1/6 of 6 inches). Similarly, the second glue stick has 4 inches left (since 4 inches is equal to 2/3 of 6 inches). Together they occupy 1 inch + 4 inches = 5 inches. Since the whole glue stick is 6 inches, the third glue stick must be 6 inches - 5 inches = 1 inch long.
