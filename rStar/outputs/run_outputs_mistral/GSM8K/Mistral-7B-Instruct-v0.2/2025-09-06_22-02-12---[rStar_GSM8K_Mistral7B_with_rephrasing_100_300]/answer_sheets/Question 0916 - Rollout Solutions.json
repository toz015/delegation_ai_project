First let's find out how much they spent on ice cream. They spent 2 tubs for 7 dollars each so they spent 7 + 7 = 14 dollars on ice cream. Next we need to find out how much they spent on balloons. 1 dozen balloons cost 0.5 dollar per balloon and they bought 1 dozen so they spent 0.5 * 12 = 6 dollars on balloons. That leaves them with the original allowance minus the money they spent on the cake, ice cream and balloons. Let's call the original allowance of both girls 'x'. We know that 2x - 14 - 6 > 11 (because the cake cost more than 11 dollars). Solving this inequality, we can see that 2x > 21 which means that x > 10.5. Since the amount of allowance cannot be negative, the smallest possible value for x would be 11. Therefore the minimum combined allowance that Julia and Nadine had is 11+11=22.

Let x be the original amount given to both girls. After buying the cake ($11), they spent x - 11. They then bought 2 dozens of balloons, costing x / (2 * 0.5) = 2x.
