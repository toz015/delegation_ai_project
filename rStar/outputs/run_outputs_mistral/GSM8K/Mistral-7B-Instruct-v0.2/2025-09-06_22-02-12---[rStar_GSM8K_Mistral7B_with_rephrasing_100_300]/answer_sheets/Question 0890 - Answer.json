{"id": 890, "problem": "There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. Two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.\nSo, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.\nThere are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.\nAnd 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.\nThus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.\n#### 25", "gold_answer": "25"}
