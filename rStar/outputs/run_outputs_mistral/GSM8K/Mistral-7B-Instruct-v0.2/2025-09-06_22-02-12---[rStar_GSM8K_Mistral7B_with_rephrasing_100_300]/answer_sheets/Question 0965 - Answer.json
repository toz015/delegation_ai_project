Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.\nFlying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.\nAnd flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.\nAltogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles\n#### 374", "gold_answer": "374"}
