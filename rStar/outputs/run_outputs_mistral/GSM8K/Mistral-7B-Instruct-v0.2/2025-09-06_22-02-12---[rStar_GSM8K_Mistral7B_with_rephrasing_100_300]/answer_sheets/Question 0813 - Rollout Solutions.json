John made 9 S'mores and used 9 marshmallows. That leaves them with 35 - 9 = 26 marshmallows. They both made 9 S'mores, so each kid used 9 marshmallows. Each kid gets 26 / 2 = 13. However, since they dropped 3 marshmallows, they actually have 26 - 3 = 23 marshmallows left. Since they both already made 9 S'mores, they cannot make another S'more each with these remaining marshmallows. Therefore, this problem doesn't have a valid solution.
