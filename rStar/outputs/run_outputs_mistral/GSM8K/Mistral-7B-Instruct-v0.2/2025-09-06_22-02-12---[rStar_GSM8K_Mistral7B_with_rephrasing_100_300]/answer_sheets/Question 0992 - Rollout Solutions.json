Since he writes checks twice monthly for the church, we subtract the number of checks for the church from the total number of checks. In a normal month (4 weeks) Buford writes checks for 4 weeks x 2 checks/week = 8 checks. But since he also writes one check per month for the pest and lawn service, it adds up to 9 checks. But for the electricity and gas bills, he writes only 2 checks per month. Therefore, the difference between the total number of checks and the checks for the church and the pest and lawn service is equal to the number of checks he writes per month for electricity and gas bills: 9 checks - 3 checks (church) - 1 check (pest and lawn service) = 5 checks.
