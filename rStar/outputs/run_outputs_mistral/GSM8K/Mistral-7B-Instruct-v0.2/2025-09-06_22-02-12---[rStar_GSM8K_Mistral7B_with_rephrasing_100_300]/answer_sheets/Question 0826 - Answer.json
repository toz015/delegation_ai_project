{"id": 826, "problem": "On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.\nShe has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.\nAnd finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.\nAdded all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.\n#### 27", "gold_answer": "27"}
