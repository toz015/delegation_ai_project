Peter has twice as many, so Peter has 2X socks. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has X/2 dishes. Jack collects twice as many dishes as socks in the store, so Jack collects X*2 dishes. Therefore, Peter has 2X socks and X/2 dishes, and Jack collects X*2 dishes. Since we know that Jack's socks and dishes form a proportion of 1:2, we can write this equation: X : X*2 = 1 : 2. Solving this equation, we find X = 4. So Peter has 2*4 = 8 socks.
