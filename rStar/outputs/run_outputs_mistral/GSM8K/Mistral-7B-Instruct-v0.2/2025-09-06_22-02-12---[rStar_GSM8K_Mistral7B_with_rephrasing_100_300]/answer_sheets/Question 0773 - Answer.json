{"id": 773, "problem": "Anthony had 50 pencils. He gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, and he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. He kept the remaining pencils. How many pencils did Anthony keep?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils\nSo, there were 50 -25 = <<50-25=25>>25 pencils left.\nCharlie got 25 x 3/5 = <<25*3/5=15>>15 pencils.\nThus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.\nTherefore, Anthony kept 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 pencils.\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
