John solves an extreme sudoku puzzle in 4 times what it takes for a normal one. But we are asked for the time spent on a normal puzzle. To find that out, we have to figure out first how long it takes for an extreme one, then divide it by 4. A normal puzzle takes 45 minutes. An extreme one takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes. Dividing 180 minutes by 60 gives us 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can also say it's 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes. Finally, dividing 180 minutes by 2 (half hours) gives us 90 half hours. This is twice as long as a normal sudoku, which means a normal one lasts for half this time. That is 90 / 2 = 45 half hours or 45 minutes. The answer is: 45.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.
