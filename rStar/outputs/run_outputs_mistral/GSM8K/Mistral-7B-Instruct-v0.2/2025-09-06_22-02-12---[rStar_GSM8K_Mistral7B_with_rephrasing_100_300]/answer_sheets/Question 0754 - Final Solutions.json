We know that one large sticker is worth three small buttons and that one small sticker is worth one small button. Hence, one large sticker is worth 3 small buttons and 3 small buttons in turn are worth 3 buttons. Consequently, one large sticker is worth 3 * 3 = 9 small buttons. Since Lorraine has 3 small stickers left, she can exchange them for 3 buttons. Regarding her large stickers, she can trade each large sticker for 3 buttons.
