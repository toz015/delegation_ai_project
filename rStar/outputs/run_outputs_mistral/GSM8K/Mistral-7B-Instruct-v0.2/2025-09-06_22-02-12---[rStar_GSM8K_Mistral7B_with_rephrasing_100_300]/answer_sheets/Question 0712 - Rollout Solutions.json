Amy therefore eats fewer pieces than Ginger each day, but because she starts off with fewer pieces, she may finish up with more. To determine if this is true, let's find out how many pieces of candy both girls have after 14 days:\nGinger's remaining candy: 100 - 56 = <<100-56=44>>44 pieces\nAmy's remaining candy: 100 - 42 = <<100-42=58>>58 pieces\nSo, despite eating fewer pieces each day, Amy actually finishes up with more pieces than Ginger! The answer is: Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger, or in other words, Amy has <<58-4", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.

Both girls start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces per day, so she consumes 4 x 14 = 56 pieces in two weeks (since there are 14 days in two weeks). Amy eats 3 pieces per day, so she consumes 3 x 14 = 42 pieces in two weeks. Ginger ends up with 100 - 56 = 44 pieces. Amy ends up with 100 - 42 = 58 pieces. The difference between their amounts is 58 - 44 = 14. The answer is: 14.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
