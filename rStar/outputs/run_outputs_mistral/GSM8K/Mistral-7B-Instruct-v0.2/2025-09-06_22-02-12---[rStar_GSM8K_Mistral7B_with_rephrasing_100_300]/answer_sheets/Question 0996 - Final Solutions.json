We know that Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4. Thus, their combined age is 3 + 4 = 7 years. Condition 3 states that the total age of the four children is 20. Since we know the ages of three children (Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene), the remaining child's age is 20 - 7 = 13. The average age can now be calculated by dividing the total sum of all the children's ages by the number of children. Therefore, the total sum of ages is 7 (Akbar & Alessandro) + Helene's age + 13. However, Condition 2 states that Helene's age equals twice the average age of all four children, so Helene's age = 2 * Average Age. Solving this equation, we get Average Age = Helene's Age / 2.

According to the problem statement, Helene's age equals twice the average age of all four children. That means Helene's age = 2 * Average Age. Also, the total age of the children is 20 years, so the sum of their ages is 20. Given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, their combined age is 7. Therefore, the sum of all the children's ages is 7 (for Akbar and Alessandro) + Helene's Age + 13 (for the last child). Using this information, we can set up the following equation:\n\nTotal Age = Sum of All Children's Ages = 7 (Akbar & Alessandro) + Helene's Age + 13\n\nSince we know that Helene's age = 2 * Average Age, we can write another equation using this information:\n\nHelene's Age = 2 * Average Age\n\nBy solving these equations simultaneously, we will find both Helene's age and the average age.
