On Monday, Rita picked 39 Junebugs. From Tuesday to Wednesday, she picked 78 Junebugs (twice as many as she picked on Monday). On Thursday, she picked 48.

First, we need to find out how many Junebugs Rita removed on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. We know that she removed twice as many as she did on Monday on both Tuesday and Wednesday.
