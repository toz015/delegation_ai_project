First, we determine how many units Dale has in total. Dale originally had 100 units, sold 150 units, and ordered 100 units. So he currently has 100 + 150 - 100 = 150 units. Let x represent the number of units Dale needs to sell to fulfill all his orders. We know that he already has 150 units, so he still needs to sell x - 150 units. Since he originally bought 100 units, when he sells another 100 units, he will have fulfilled all his orders. Therefore, x = 150 + 100 = 250.
