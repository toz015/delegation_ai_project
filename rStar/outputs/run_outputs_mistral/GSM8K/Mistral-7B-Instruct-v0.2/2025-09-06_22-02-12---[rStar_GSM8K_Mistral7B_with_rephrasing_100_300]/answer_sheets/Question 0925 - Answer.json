They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.\nIf 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.\nThe total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons\n#### 2000", "gold_answer": "2000"}
