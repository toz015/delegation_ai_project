So Mark makes 5000 - 5400 = -$400 in loss initially. But since it's not clear whether the question asks about money spent or profit made, let me assume the question is about profit made. This means we need to find out how much he actually earns from selling the cards instead of just calculating cost. Let's assume he sells all cards for the average price. To calculate this, add the value of cards he already knows ($5000 from above) and the unknown worth of the remaining cards ($1500): $5000 + $1500 = $6500.
