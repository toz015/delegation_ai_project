However, he also pays $500 a month for his car payment. To find his profit, we need to subtract his car payment cost from the revenue he earns from renting out his car.

He gets paid $25 an hour.  If his car payment is $500, how much profit does he make on his car?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. John rents his car for 10 hours per month at 3 dollars per hour. That's 10 x 3 = 30 dollars in revenue each month. He pays 500 dollars for car payments. His profit would be 30 dollars revenue minus 500 dollars expenses which equals -470 dollars. However, this result suggests a loss rather than a profit. We made an error here, so let us calculate it again: 10 hours/month x $25/hour = $250/month in revenue. Profit is Revenue - Expenses = $250/month - $500/month = -$250/month. That isn't right either. It seems we mixed up revenue and expenses. Let's try once more: John rents his car for 10 hours per month at 3 dollars per hour, making him 10 x $25 = $250 in revenue per month. With expenses being $500, his profit would be $250 revenue - $500 expenses = -$250. This calculation indicates a loss", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
