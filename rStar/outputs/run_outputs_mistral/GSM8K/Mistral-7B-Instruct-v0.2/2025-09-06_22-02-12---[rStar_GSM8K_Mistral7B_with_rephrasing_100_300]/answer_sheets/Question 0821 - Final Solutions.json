That leaves 70 / 2 = 35 cars. However, we need to find the number of cars Hunter actually counted during the lunch break. He didn't count all the cars again; instead, he found that \"half\" had gone. This means that the remaining cars make up the other half. Since there were initially 50 cars, the remaining cars also make up 50. Thus, Hunter counted 35 + 50 = 85 cars during lunch break. However, this answer seems incorrect because we started from an initial count of 50 cars. We made a mistake in our calculation of the number of cars after the first break. The correct number of cars after the first break is 50 + 20 = 70 cars, not 71 as previously calculated. With the corrected value of 70 cars, we now have 70 / 2 = 35 cars left after the second break, which Hunter saw during the lunch break. The actual answer is that Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break. The initial incorrect answer of 85 cars came from miscalculating the number of cars that remained after the first break. The correct sequence of calculations is as follows: Initially, there were 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more arrived, making 50+20=70 cars. After the second break, half of these cars were gone, leaving 70/2=35 cars. These 35 cars are the ones that Hunter saw during the lunch break.
