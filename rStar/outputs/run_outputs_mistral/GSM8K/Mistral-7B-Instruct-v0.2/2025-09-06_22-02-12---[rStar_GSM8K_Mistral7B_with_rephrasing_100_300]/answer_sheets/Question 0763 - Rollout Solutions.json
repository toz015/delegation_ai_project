Therefore, it needs 2 * 250 = 500 * 2 = 1000 cases of shingles."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that the third house needs double the amount of shingles as the first one. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second house's amount, the second house needs 2 * 1/2 = 1 case more than the first. So the third house needs 1 + 1 case = 2 more cases than the second, which needs 250 + 2 = 252 cases. But the question asks for 1000 cases, so our initial assumption about the third house needing double the first was incorrect. Let me apologize for the error in my previous response. Based on the information provided, it seems likely that the third house requires 1000 cases of shingles, but we cannot be certain without knowing the exact relationship between the amounts needed for the different houses. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer at this time. However, if the third house does indeed require double the amount of shingles as the first, then the answer is 1000.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
