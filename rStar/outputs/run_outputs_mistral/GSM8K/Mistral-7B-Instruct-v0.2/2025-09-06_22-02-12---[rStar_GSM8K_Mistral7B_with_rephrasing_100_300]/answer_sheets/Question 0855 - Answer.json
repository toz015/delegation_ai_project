{"id": 855, "problem": "I am three years younger than my brother, and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.\nMy mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.\nThe sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.\nMultiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.\nSubtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.\n#### 13", "gold_answer": "13"}
