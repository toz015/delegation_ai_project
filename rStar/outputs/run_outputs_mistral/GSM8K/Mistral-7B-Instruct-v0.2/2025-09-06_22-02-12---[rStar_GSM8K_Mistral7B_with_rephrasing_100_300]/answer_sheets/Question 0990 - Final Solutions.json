We know it runs for 3 hours. The number of degrees it cools per hour on low is also given as 2 degrees. To find out how many degrees below the starting temperature the room is now, we need to calculate the temperature difference due to both the cooling effect of the air conditioner and the warming effect when it's turned off.

Next, let's calculate the amount of heating during the following 2 hours when the air conditioner is off: 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees. Since the room was initially cooled by 6 degrees, but then heated by 4 degrees, the net change in temperature depends on which is greater, the cooling or the heating.
