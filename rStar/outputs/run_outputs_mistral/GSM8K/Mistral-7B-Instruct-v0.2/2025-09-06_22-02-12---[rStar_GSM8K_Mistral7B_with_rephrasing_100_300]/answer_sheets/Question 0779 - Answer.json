{"id": 779, "problem": "The Llesis family drove and hiked 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.\nHence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.\nSo, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.\nIt took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.\nSo, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.\nTherefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.\n#### 255", "gold_answer": "255"}
