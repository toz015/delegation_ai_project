Let's assume Anne has X number of books. From condition 2 we know that Sofie has X + 25 books. And according to condition 3, Fawn holds X + 12 books. Since the collective number of books owned by all three women equals to 85, we can write this equation: X + (X+25) + (X+12) = 85. Solving this equation will yield the value of X. X + X + 25 + X + 12 = 85 => 3*X + 38 = 85 => 3*X = 47 => X = 15.7 => This result doesn't make sense since it's not possible for someone to own a fraction of a book.
