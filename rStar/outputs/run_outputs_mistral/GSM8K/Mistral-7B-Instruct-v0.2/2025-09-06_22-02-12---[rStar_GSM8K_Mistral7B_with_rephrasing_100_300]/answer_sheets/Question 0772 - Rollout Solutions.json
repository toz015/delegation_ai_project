First, we find out how much time Tatiana spends working during her weekend: 12 hours. Since Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, there are 12 - 3 = 9 hours remaining for other activities. One third of these hours is spent playing video games: 9 / 3 = 3 hours. To find out what percentage of her weekend time Tatiana spends playing soccer (assuming she doesn't play soccer while working), we can first find out how many hours she spends doing all activities besides soccer, which is 12 hours (weekend work) - 3 hours (reading). Since Tatiana spends 3 hours playing video games, she must spend the rest of her time playing soccer. We calculate the percentage by dividing the time she spends playing soccer by her total weekend time: 3 hours soccer / 12 hours weekend = 1/4 or 0.25, so 25%.
