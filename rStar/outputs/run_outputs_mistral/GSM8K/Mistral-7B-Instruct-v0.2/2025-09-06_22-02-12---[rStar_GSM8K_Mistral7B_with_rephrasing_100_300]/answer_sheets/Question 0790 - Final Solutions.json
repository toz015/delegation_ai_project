We find that we need 90 people to form groups, so the number of groups required is 90 / 9 = 10.

According to the problem statement, 3/5 of the groups collect 2 seashells each. Hence, each group collects (1 + 2*(3/5)) = 7/3 seashells. But since we cannot have a fractional seashell, we round this number down to get the exact amount.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of seashells collected, we multiply the number of groups (which we determined earlier as 11) by the number of seashells collected per group (which is 4): 11 groups * 4 seashells/group = 44 seashells.\n\nSo the answer is: 44 seashells.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
