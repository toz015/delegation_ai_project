They needed $6300 for their fundraiser goal. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. To find out how long it took them to raise this much, we can divide the amount they raised by what they raised per hour. Since we know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we can calculate how much they raised per hour: $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour. We want to know how long it took for them to raise $2100, so we divide the amount they raised by their hourly rate: $2100 / $700/hour = 3 hours.
