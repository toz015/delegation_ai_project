Ellen has 1 daily meal that includes a salad, a yogurt, and 2 carrots. Let's find the cost of her salad and yogurt first.\n\nCondition 2 states that a yogurt costs half as much as a salad, so a yogurt costs $6/2 = $3. Therefore, her salad costs $6 and her yogurt costs $3. In total, her food costs $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9. However, we know her total daily expenses is $11.\n\nSo, the remaining amount Ellen spends each day on her 2 carrots would be $11 - $9 = $2.\n\nSince Ellen eats 2 carrots per day, each carrot costs $2 / 2 = $1.\n\nThe answer is: $1.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
