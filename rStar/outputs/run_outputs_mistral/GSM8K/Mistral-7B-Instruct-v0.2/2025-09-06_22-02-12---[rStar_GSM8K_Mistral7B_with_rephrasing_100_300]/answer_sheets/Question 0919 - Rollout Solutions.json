To raise the needed amount of money for the class fund, each student sold 30 students x $X = the total amount of money. 10 lollipops at $0.8 each costs $10, so this covers only part of the needed amount. Since these students didn't pay anything for the lollipops, the missing amount was covered by another source (like parents). However, this question asks for the number of lollipops sold by each student. If each student sold $10 worth of lollipops, they would sell $10 / $0.8 = 12.5. But since it is not possible to sell half a lollipop, it means each student actually sold less than $10 worth of lollipops. Let's try assuming each student sold exactly $9 worth of lollipops. That would mean they sold 9 x $0.8 = 7.2 lollipops, but again, it is not possible to sell a fraction of a lollipop.

Then, the difference between what they collected and what they spent can be divided among the students. Each student spent $0.5 * 12 = $6 on lollipops. So, the profit for the class is $9.5 * 30 - $6 * 30 = $273. And we know that the total profit should be enough to cover the cost of the lollipops and reach the target amount. We can check if our assumption was correct by verifying if $273 is enough. Indeed, $273 is greater than $267, which is the total amount of money spent on the lollipops plus the required amount for the class fund ($267 = $252 on lollipops + $15 for the class fund).
