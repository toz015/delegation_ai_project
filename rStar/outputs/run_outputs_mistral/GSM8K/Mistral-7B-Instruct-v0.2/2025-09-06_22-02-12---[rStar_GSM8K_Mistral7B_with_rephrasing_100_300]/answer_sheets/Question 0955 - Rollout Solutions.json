Since the initial occupancy leaves only 800 beds available, it takes 800 / 50 = 16 days for all the empty beds to be filled. Therefore, no new patients can be admitted on the 15th day. Since we wanted to know how many patients were admitted during the first 14 days, the answer is: 14 * 50 = 700.

At first, 1/5th of the beds are occupied, which means 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds are occupied. Everyday, 50 new patients come in. In two weeks, which is 14 days, 50 new patients will be admitted 14 times, so there will be 50 * 14 = 700 new occupied beds. Subtracting those from the original number of beds gives us 1000 - 700 = 300 unoccupied beds. The answer is: 300.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
