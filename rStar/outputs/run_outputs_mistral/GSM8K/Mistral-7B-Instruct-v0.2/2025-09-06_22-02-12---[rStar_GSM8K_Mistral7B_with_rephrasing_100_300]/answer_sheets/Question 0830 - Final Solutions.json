Since each video is 4 minutes long, it takes 4 minutes to record one video. Next, we find out how many videos she records per week: 18 videos/week. To see how long it takes her to record all these videos, we multiply the number of videos by the time it takes to record one video: 18 videos * 4 minutes = 72 minutes/week. We also know that she spends 2 hours/week writing songs, which converts to 120 minutes/week because there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Since one TikTok video takes 4 minutes, we can find out how many videos she records in this period by dividing the total recording time by the length of one video: 282 minutes / 4 minutes = 70.5. But since she cannot make a video last half a minute, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number of videos, so she records 71 videos.
