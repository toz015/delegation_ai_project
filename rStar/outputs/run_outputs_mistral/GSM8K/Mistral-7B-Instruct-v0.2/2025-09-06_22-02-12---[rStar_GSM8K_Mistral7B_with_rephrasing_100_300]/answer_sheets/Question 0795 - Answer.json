{"id": 795, "problem": "Mike needed a new pair of jeans.  When he got to the mall he saw that his favorite jeans were advertised 25% off.  The original price of the jeans was $40.  How much money will Mike have left over if he pays with a $50.00 bill?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The jeans cost $40 and are sale for 25% off so 40 * .25 = $<<40*.25=10.00>>10.00 discount\nTake the original cost of the jeans and subtract the discount so 40-10 = $<<40-10=30.00>>30.00\nMike pays with a $50 bill and the final cost of the jeans is $30 so 50-30 = $<<50-30=20.00>>20.00 left\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
