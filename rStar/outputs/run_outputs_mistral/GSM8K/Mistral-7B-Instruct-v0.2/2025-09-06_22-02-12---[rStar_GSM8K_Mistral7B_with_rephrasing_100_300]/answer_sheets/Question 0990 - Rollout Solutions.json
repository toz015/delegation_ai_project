Initially, let's set the starting temperature as our reference point, which is 0 degrees. During the first 3 hours, the AC runs at 2 degrees/hour on low, so it cools 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees. After that, the AC runs at 3 degrees/hour on high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees. But during the following 2 hours without the AC running, the room warms up 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees. So the net change in temperature is 6 degrees (cooling due to AC while on low) + 12 degrees (cooling due to AC while on high) - 4 degrees (warming up when the AC is off).
