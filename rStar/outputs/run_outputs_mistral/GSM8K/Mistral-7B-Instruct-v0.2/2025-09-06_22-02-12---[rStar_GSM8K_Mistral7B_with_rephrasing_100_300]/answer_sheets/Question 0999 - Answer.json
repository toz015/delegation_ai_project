{"id": 999, "problem": "A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.\nSince each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon\nSo the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage\nThe percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)\nx = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.\n#### 25", "gold_answer": "25"}
