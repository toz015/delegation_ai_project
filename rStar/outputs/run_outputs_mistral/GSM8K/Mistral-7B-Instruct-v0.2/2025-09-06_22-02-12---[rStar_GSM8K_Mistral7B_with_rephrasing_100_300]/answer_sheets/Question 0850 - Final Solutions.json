According to condition 4, Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. That would mean 45 * 2 = 90 goats were sold from Farm Y. Since there are 45 goats originally, it means Mr. Smith took all the goats from Farm Y. The total number of goats on both farms is then 45 (from Farm X) + 0 (from Farm Y) = 45.
