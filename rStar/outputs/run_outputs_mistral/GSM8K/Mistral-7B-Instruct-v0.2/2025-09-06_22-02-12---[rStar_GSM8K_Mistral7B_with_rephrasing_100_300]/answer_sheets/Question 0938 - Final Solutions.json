First we find out how much John made during the week. That's 50 dollars per hour times 6 hours, so he made 50*6=300 dollars. From this, we subtract the 50 dollars for gas, leaving us with 300-50=250 dollars. We don't know exactly how much the pens cost, but we're told they're 25 dollar pens. To find out how many pens John can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen. That's 250/25. Since this isn't a whole number, it means John cannot buy this exact number of pens. However, we can determine that he can buy 10 pens (since 10*25=250), and possibly fewer, depending on if he wants to save any money. The question doesn't state that John wants to buy as many pens as possible, just enough to spend all of his remaining money.
