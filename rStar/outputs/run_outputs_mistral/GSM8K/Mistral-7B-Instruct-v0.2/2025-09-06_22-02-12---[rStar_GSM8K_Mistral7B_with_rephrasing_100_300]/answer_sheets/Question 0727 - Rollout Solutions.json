But we know she breaks a total of 112 windows, so our math is wrong somewhere. Let me double check it: I made an error on the calculation for the windows of the teacher's cars. It should be 32 teachers' cars * 2 windows per car * 1/2 = 64 windows, not 384. Therefore, the correct answer is 112 windows = 112 windows Hannah broke. I apologize for the confusion caused earlier.
