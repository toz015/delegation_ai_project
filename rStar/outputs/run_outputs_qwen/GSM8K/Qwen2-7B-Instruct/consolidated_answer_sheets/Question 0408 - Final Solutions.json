This leaves him with \\(60 - 10 = 50\\) minutes to dedicate solely to reading the book.\n\n2. **Words Per Page**:\n   We're told the book is 45 pages long, averaging 200 words per page. So, the total word count of the book is calculated by multiplying these numbers together: \\(45 \\times 200 = 9000\\) words.\n\nThis means the entire book contains 9000 words.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question regarding the total number of words in the entire book, based purely on its size and average page length, is: **9000** words.\nThe answer is: 9000.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How long will it take Toby to finish reading the book?", "subanswer": {"text": "Given Toby reads at a speed of 300 words per minute, to find out how long it will take him to read the entire book, which contains 9000 words, you divide the total number of words by his reading speed:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How long will it take Toby to finish reading the book?", "subanswer": {"text": "The time required for Toby to finish reading the book is calculated by dividing the total word count of the book by his reading speed.
