{"id": 638, "problem": "In a grocery store, four apples cost $5.20, and three oranges cost $3.30. How much will Clyde pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.\nEach orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.\nSo 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.\nAnd 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.\nThus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.\n#### 12", "gold_answer": "12"}
