Charisma works 8 hours a day, which means she triggers the timer 8 times during her workday. Each time the timer goes off, she walks for 5 minutes. To find out how many minutes she walks each workday, we multiply the number of times the timer goes off (which is equal to the number of working hours) by the amount of walking time per event:\n\n\\[ \\text{Walking Time per Day} = (\\text{Number of Hours Worked}) \\times (\\text{Minutes Walked per Hour}) \\]\n\nGiven numbers:\n- Number of Hours Worked = 8\n- Minutes Walked per Hour = 5\n\nSubstituting these values into our formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Walking Time per Day} = (8 \\, \\text{hours}) \\times (5 \\, \\text{minutes/hour}) = 40 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe answer is: 40.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many minutes has she walked after 5 days at the office?", "subanswer": {"text": "Charisma walks 40 minutes each workday.
