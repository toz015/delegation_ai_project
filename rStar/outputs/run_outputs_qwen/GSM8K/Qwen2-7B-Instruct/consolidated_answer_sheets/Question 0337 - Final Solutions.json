Specifically, it can be hard to pinpoint which patterns or trends (the signal) are significant versus random fluctuations (the noise), especially when the data is complex and multidimensional.\n\nThe proposed method tackles this issue through a few key steps:\n1. **Model Selection**: It starts by choosing models that can handle both low- and high-frequency components of the data well", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 4}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
