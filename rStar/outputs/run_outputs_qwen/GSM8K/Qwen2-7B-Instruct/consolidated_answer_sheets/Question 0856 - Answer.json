{"id": 856, "problem": "Mr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.\nDivide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.\nSince Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.\nMr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.\n#### 7", "gold_answer": "7"}
