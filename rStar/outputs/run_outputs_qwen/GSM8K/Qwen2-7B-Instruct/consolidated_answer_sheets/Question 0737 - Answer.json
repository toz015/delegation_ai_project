{"id": 737, "problem": "Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce. If he makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.\nThe medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.\nThe small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.\nThis means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.\nPeter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
