First, calculate James' swim time based on Jon's time. Jon swims in 40 minutes, which is 40/100 * 10% = 4 minutes less for James. So James' swim time is 40-4=36 minutes.\n\nNow we know Jon's times: Swim = 40 min, Bike = 1 hr 20 min or 80 min, Run = 50 min.\nTotal Jon's time is 40+80+50 = 170 min.\n\nSince Jon won by 10 minutes, James completed the race in 170-10 = 160 min.\n\nNow let's find out how long it took James to run. We know James' total time (160 min), his swim time (36 min) and bike time (James' bike time is 5 min longer than Jon's, which makes it 80+5 = 85 min).\n\nSo the sum of swim and bike times for James is 36+85 = 121 min.\n\nSubtracting this from James's's running total, how is: 5 James", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jon runs a triathlon.
