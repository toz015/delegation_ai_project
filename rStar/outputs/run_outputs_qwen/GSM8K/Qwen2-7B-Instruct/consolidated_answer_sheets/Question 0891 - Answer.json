{"id": 891, "problem": "A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. How fast does a whirligig spin?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.\nA whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = <<11*5=55>>55 meters per second.\n#### 55", "gold_answer": "55"}
