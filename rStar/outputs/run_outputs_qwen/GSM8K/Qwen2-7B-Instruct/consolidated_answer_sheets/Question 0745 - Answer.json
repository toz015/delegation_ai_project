There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  How much money profit did he make?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500\nSo all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500\nThe cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400\nSo he made a profit of 6500-5400=$<<6500-5400=1100>>1100\n#### 1100", "gold_answer": "1100"}
