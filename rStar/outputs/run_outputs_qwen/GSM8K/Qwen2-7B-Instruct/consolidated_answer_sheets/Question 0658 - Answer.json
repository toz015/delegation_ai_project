{"id": 658, "problem": "Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.\nThe total cooking time for pork and rice is 50+30 = <<50+30=80>>80 minutes.\nThe beans cooked 1/2*80 = <<80*1/2=40>>40 minutes to cook.\nThe total amount of time taken to cook all the food is 40+50+30 = <<40+50+30=120>>120 minutes.\n#### 120", "gold_answer": "120"}
