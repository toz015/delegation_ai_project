First, let's identify the total number of pages Mike needs to read. The hint mentions this is 200 pages. Next, we know Mike plans to read 10 pages each day. To find out how many days it will take him to complete the assignment, divide the total number of pages (200) by the number of pages he plans to read each day (10). That means 200 / 10 = 20 days.
