However, if we assume that the question intends to convey that the initial monthly cost was some unknown value 'x' and based on this, let's calculate under that assumption:\n\n- Initial funding for 5 months: $100,000.\n- Assuming the first 5 months cost 'x' dollars per month.\n\nGiven that the entire project takes 10 times as long, it actually lasts for \\(10 \\times 5 = 50\\) months instead of 5 months. Since every month after the initial 5 took 50% more funding than the previous one, we can calculate the monthly cost during the subsequent period (which starts from the 6th month) using geometric progression or series since each month costs \\(1.5x\\) relative to the previous one.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing what 'x' (the initial monthly cost) is specifically, or having the actual numbers that would allow us to backtrack or calculate 'x', it's not possible to provide a numerical answer for the initial monthly cost ('x') based solely on the provided information. We'd need either 'x' directly specified or more concrete", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The problem requires additional specifics about the initial monthly cost for the first five months of research which wasn't provided.
