{"id": 614, "problem": "Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, and a gallon of water costs $0.15. How much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year\nThen find how much each load of laundry costs: 20 gallons/load * $0.15/gallon = $<<20*0.15=3.00>>3.00/load\nThen multiply the cost of each load by the number of loads to find the total cost: $3.00/load * 104 loads = $<<3*104=312>>312\n#### 312", "gold_answer": "312"}
