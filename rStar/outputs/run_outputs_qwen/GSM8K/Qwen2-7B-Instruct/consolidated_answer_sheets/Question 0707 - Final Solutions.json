This means that industrial users take 80% of this amount (since it's stated that 80% of what the city uses is for industrial purposes). To find out how much of the total water is used for non-industrial purposes:\n\nFirst, calculate what portion is used for industrial purposes within the city's usage: \\(40\\% \\times 80\\% = 0.4 \\times 0.8 = 0.32\\) or \\(32\\%\\).\n\nSince the city uses 40% of the total water, subtracting the portion used industrially (\\(32\\%\\)) leaves the remainder for non-industrial use: \\(40\\% - 32\\% = 8\\%\\).\n\nThus, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.\n\nThe answer is: 8%.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
