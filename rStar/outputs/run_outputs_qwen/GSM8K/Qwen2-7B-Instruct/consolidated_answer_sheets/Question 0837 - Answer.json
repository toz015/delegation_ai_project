{"id": 837, "problem": "Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 \u2013 $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.\nWe know she doesn't have all the money yet, so she actually has $400 \u2013 $50 = $<<400-50=350>>350 dollars.\nSome of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 \u2013 $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.\nSubtracting her part-time wages shows that she had $270 \u2013 $150 = $<<270-150=120>>120 in her purse.\n#### 120", "gold_answer": "120"}
