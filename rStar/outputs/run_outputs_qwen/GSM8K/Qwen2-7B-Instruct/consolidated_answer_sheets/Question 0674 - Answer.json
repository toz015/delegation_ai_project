{"id": 674, "problem": "Mrs. Jameson's bamboo in the backyard grows up to 30 inches a day. Today, its height is 20 feet. In how many days will its height be 600 inches?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.\nSo, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.\nTherefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.\n#### 12", "gold_answer": "12"}
