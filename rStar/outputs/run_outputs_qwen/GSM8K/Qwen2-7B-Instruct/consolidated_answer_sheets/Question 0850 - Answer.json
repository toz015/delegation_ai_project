{"id": 850, "problem": "Mr. Smith has two farms, Farm X and Farm Y. He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many goats from Farm Y. How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.\nMr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.\nThus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.\nTherefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.\n#### 70", "gold_answer": "70"}
