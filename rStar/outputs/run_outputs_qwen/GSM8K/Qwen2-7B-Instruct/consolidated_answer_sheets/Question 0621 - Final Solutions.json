At $125 per hour, the duration of one visit was 2 * $125 = 250 dollars. So, for all 12 visits, it would amount to 12 * $250 = $3000. However, according to the hint provided, the correct total cost is $750. The discrepancy comes from incorrectly calculating the total cost based on individual visit durations instead of counting the total number of sessions. \n\nGiven the instruction includes a direct calculation method (6 weeks * 2 times/week * 2 hours/time * $125/hour), this approach directly leads to the correct total cost as initially stated:\n\nTotal cost = 6 * 2 * 2 * $125\n           = 24 * $125\n           = $3000\n\nThe answer provided with the hint contradicts the given method of calculation leading to confusion.
