{"id": 803, "problem": "Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. If Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks then plays for 2 hours every day for a week, how many hours does she still need to play to earn the achievement?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.\nSo playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.\nPlaying for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.\nShe therefore still needs to play 30 \u2013 7 \u2013 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
