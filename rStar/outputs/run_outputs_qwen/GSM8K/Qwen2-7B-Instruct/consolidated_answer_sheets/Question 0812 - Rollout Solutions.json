She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\nFirst, Rose picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which totals to \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) petals.\nNext, she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, adding up to \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) petals.\nThen, she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, bringing us to \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) petals.\nLastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, totaling \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\) petals.\n\nAdding all these together before any are dropped or blown away: \\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\\) petals.\n\nNow, she drops 1 flower from each category, meaning she drops one 5-petal flower, one 6-petal flower, one 4-petal flower, and one 7-petal flower. These would add up to \\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\\) petals in total that were dropped and blown away.\n\nSubtracting the petals lost from the total original count: \\(101 - 22 = 79", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
