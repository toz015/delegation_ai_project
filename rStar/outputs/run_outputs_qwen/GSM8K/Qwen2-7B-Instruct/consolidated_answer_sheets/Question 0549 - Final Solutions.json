Given the steps towards finding out the total needed toys first and then relating it back to what's asked in the question regarding 'current' possession, there's an implicit assumption about what 'needs' implies relative to 'has'. However, since direct computation of Jonathan's current toy count from the given data doesn't yield a definitive numerical answer without additional specifics tied to '2 more than needed', the precise answer isn't straightforwardly derived solely from 'needs'.
