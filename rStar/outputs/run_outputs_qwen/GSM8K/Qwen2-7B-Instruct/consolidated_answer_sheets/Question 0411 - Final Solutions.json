First, calculate the cost of all fireworks packages together before the discount:\n\n- The first package costs $400,\n- The second package costs $800 (which is twice as much as the first).\n\nSo, the total cost of the two packages before any discount would be: \n$400 (first package) + $800 (second package) = $1200 \n\nNext, apply the 20% discount:\nTo find 20% of $1200: $1200 * 20/100 = $240\n\nNow subtract this discount amount from the original total to find out how much was paid for the fireworks packages:\n$1200 (original total without discount) - $240 (discount amount) = $960\n\nLastly, add the cost of the finale firework which is $150:\n$960 (cost after discount for packages) + $150 (finale firework) = $1110\n\nTherefore, Tim spent $1110 in total on the fireworks for the Fourth of July celebration. \n\nThe answer is: 1110", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.
