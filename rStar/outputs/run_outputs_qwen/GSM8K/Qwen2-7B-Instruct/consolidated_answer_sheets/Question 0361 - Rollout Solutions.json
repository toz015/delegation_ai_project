The distance back from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than this combined distance, which makes \\( 175 - 50 = 125 \\) miles.\n\nSo, one round trip covers the distances as follows:\n\n- From 1st to 2nd: 75 miles\n- From 2nd to 3rd: 100 miles\n- From 3rd back to 1st: 125 miles\n\nTherefore, one round trip distance = \\( 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \\) miles.\n\nGiven that it does this trip 3 times a day, the total daily distance traveled would be \\( 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\) miles.\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically about the distance from the first city to the second city, then to the third", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the total daily travel distance for the specific path mentioned, which is from the first city to the second city, then to the third city and back to the first city. This distance per round trip is calculated above as \\( 75 + 100 + (175 - 50) = 300 \\) miles."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The train travels 300 miles per trip (from the first to second city, then second to third, and finally from third back to first). Since it makes three trips a day, its total daily mileage is \\( 3 \\times 300 = 900 \\) miles. To find out when it requires service, we divide the total required distance for service, 18,000 miles, by its daily travel distance, which is \\( \\frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \\) days. The answer is: 20 days.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
