Half of Mary's 30 sheep means 30 / 2 = 15 sheep.\nFrom this group, she gets 1 kg of milk from each one every day so she gets a total of 15 * 1 = 15 kg per day.\nTherefore, the amount of milk she gets from these 15 sheep every day is 15 kg.\n\nThe answer is: 15.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we find out how many sheep provide 1 kg of milk. That's 30 / 2 = 15 sheep. Those 15 sheep each produce 1 kg of milk. Then we multiply the number of such sheep (which is also the half of all the sheep) by how much milk each contributes (which is 1 kg). So it's 15 * 1 = 15 kg per day from half of the sheep. The other half of the sheep contribute twice as much (since 2 kg of milk is received), which amounts to another 15 * 2 = 30 kg per day from the other half. Adding both contributions together, we obtain 15 + 30 = 45 kg of milk per day.\n\nThe answer is: 45.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
