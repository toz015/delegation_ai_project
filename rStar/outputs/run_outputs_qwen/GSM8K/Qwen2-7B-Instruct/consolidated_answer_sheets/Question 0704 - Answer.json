{"id": 704, "problem": "Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, how much money did he have left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.\nSo each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.\nSo Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.\nGerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.\nTherefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
