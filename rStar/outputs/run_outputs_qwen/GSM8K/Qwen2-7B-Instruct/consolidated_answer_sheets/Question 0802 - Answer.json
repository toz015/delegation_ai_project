If she wants to buy enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x = the number of stuffed goats.\nThe current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.\nTake the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3\nCross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x\nSubtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42\nBubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.\n#### 6", "gold_answer": "6"}
