From this information alone, we still can't find out how many cows are in the farm because we need another relationship. Instead let's calculate the number of sheep the farm and the zoo have using the fact that the zoo has twice as many cows than the farm. This implies that if the farm has F cowes, the zoo must have 2F cows. Furthermore since the zoo has twice as many sheep than the farm it must be true that the farm has one fourth of the sheep that the zoo has. Given that the farm has F cows the zoo must have 2F cows.

Now, we will continue using this information. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, or put differently, the farm has 1/4 of the sheep that the zoo has. If the farm has 1/4 of the sheep that the zoo has, and we know that the zoo has 20 sheep, then the number of cows the farm has can be expressed as: (1/4)(20) = X cows, which we already solved above as having 5 cows.
