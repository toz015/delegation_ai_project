First, we need to find out how many history teachers there are. We can get this by calculating 60% of 150. To do this, first convert the percent into a decimal. Since there are two numbers after the decimal point in sixty, you should divide both by ten. Sixty divided by ten equals six. This means that sixty percent is equivalent to point six. Multiply point six times one hundred fifty to find out how many teachers are history teachers. Point six multiplied by one hundred fifty is ninety. Therefore, ninety teachers are history teachers. This leaves us with one hundred fifty minus ninety which is sixty. There are sixty math teachers.
