Then the number of chickens would be 2c (since there are twice as many chickens as cows). We know that the sum of the number of cows and the number of chickens equals 60. Therefore, c + 2c = 60. Simplifying the equation above, we get 3c = 60. Solving this equation for the value of c (which represents the number of cows) gives us c = 60 / 3 = 20. Knowing that the number of cows is 20, we can find the number of chickens. As stated earlier, the number of chickens would be twice the number of cows, so it would be 2 * 20 = 40. Thus, the total number of cows and chickens is 20 + 40 = 60. Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have 4 * 20 = 80 legs. Each chicken also has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.
