But what we really want to know is how many contacts are in total for 2 boxes. We know that 2 boxes will last 90 days, or 45 * 2 = 90. Since each box comes with 90 contacts, we multiply the number of contacts per box by the number of boxes we need. That would be 2 * 90 = 180 contacts. Now we know that we need 180 contacts over 90 days, so we need 180 / 2 = 90 pairs of contacts. Next, let's find out how many pairs of contacts you can buy for your money.

We can just multiply the number of pairs by the price per box then divide by the number of boxes. So the cost per box is 100x0.9=90 so the total amount spent is 180*90=$16200.

We know two boxes usually cost $200 before any discounts, but right now they're 10% off. To find 10% of 200, multiply 200 by 0.1 (which is another way of writing 10%), so 200 * 0.1 = 20.
