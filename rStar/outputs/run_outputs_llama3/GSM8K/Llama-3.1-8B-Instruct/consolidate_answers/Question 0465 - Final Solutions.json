First, we find out how many basketball cards she has. 6 decks, each with 25 basketball cards will be 6 x 25 = 150 basketball cards. Next, let's find out how many baseball cards she has. That would be 5 boxes, each with 40 baseball cards which is 5 x 40 = 200. All together, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. Since she kept 50, we subtract those from the total amount of cards: 350 - 50 = 300. Therefore, the rest of the cards (which is all of them) are going to her students so we don't need this information. Instead, we go back to what we already found: she has 6 decks. Each deck has 25 basketball cards so we can just say she has 150.

Miss Maria started with a certain number of cards, but it doesn't matter what type or quantity since she still only ended up with one value for total cards.

To do that, we'd have to calculate how many basketball cards she has, which is simply 6 decks * 25 cards per deck = 150 basketball cards. However, we could add that to the amount of baseball cards if we wanted to, but it wouldn't change the outcome. So the first part of the problem isn't relevant to figuring out how many students she has since we know she had 300 cards total to hand out.
