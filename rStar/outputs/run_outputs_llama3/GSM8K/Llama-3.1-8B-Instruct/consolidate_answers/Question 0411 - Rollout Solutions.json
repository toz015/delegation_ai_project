Tim starts with two known values: a package of fireworks worth 400 dollars and one costing twice as much. Since we don't know what any other packages cost (yet), let's represent the unknown package's value as X. Therefore, the second package costs 2X because it's worth double the first package. As stated before, there is no need to find the actual amount you pay for either item since we are looking to determine the value of the second item not including discounts. We can ignore all other information for this problem. We already have X representing the value of the first package and 2X representing the value of the second package.

The original cost of the fireworks was 400 dollars and 2 times that is 800 dollars. They both received a 20 percent discount. A twenty percent discount means you get to keep eighty percent of the product's price, or said otherwise, 0.80 * P, where P is the price. To calculate 20% of P, you simply multiply 0.20 * P. Let's start by finding the discounted price for each package: the package worth 400 dollars received a discount of 0.20 * 400, which equals 80. The discounted price is therefore 400 - 80 = 320. Similarly, the package that costs 800 dollars received a discount of 0.20 * 800 = 160. Its discounted price is 800 - 160 = 640. However, we still haven't accounted for the final piece: a fireworks set that costs 150. Adding these three together, our total is 320 + 640 + 150 = 1110.
