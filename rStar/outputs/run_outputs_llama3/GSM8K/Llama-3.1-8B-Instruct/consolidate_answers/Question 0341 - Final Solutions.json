Since a yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than any one of them, it weighs x + 10. And since a red bird is 20 pounds lighter, it weighs x - 20. We don't know what x is yet, so let's move on. From this information we get (x - 20) + 10 = x. Solving for x we get x - 10 = x; x - x = -10; 0 = -10, which isn't true! This means the problem statement was false. But we still want the value of x. Because the equation above doesn't work, the original equation was wrong. However if you add 10 to both sides of the equation, it becomes x = (x-20)+10. x = x. We can eliminate this possibility because the other way around, (-20+10)=(-30), and then that means the red bird is 30 pounds lighter than the yellow snake. We will use this information later.
