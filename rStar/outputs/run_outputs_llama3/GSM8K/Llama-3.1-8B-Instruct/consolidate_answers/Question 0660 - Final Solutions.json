However, I can provide information about how to solve the problem if we knew the number of geese. Each goose has one head, but its body contains 2 legs. Let\u2019s call the number of geese x. Since each sheep has four legs and one head, let's call the number of sheep y. Then, the total number of legs will be (x * 2) + (y * 4). The total number of animals\u2019 heads will be (x * 1) + (y * 1), because we already counted their heads, not just legs. Now we can use the problem statement: \u201cIf the total number of animal legs is 70\u201d and \u201cthe total number of animal heads is 20\u201d. Therefore, we get these equations: (x * 2) + (y * 4) = 70; (x * 1) + (y * 1) = 20. We can subtract the second equation from the first one to find (x * 2) \u2013 (x * 1) + (y * 4) \u2013 (y * 1) = 50. Simplifying this equation leads us to (x * 1) + (y * 3) = 50. We can express x in terms of y from the last equation: (x * 1) = 50 \u2013 (y * 3); so x = (50 \u2013 y * 3)/1. Next we substitute our expression for x into the second equation, replacing x by ((50 \u2013 y * 3)/1): ((50 \u2013 y * 3)/1)* 1 + (y * 1) = 20. Combining like terms we simplify the equation to 50 \u2013 3 * y + y = 20. Subtracting 20 from both sides results in 30 \u2013 3 * y + y = 0. Rearranging the equation we obtain 30 \u2013 2 * y = 0.

We know that 4x + 2y = 70 (total legs) and x + y = 20 (total animals). By substituting y = 20 - x from the second equation into the first one, we obtain 4x + 2(20-x)=70. Simplifying this gives us 40 -2x=70; therefore, x= -15, which doesn't make sense because you cannot have a negative number of sheep. Then, let's go back to our equations and substitute the expression x + y=20 for y in the first equation, resulting in 4x+2(x+20- x)=70 .Simplifying this equation results in 4x+2*20=70 , which equals 4x+40=70. Subtracting 40 from both sides yields 4x=30 and finally dividing both sides by 4 results in x=7.5. However, since you cannot have half of a sheep, there must be an error in previous steps. Let's look again at the equations. Instead of 4x + 2y = 70 and x + y = 20, we should assume there are s sheep and g geese, not x and y, so the correct equations become 4s + 2g = 70 and s + g = 20. To solve these equations simultaneously, multiply the second equation by 2, getting 2s + 2g = 40. Next subtract this equation from the equation 4s + 2g = 70 to get 2s = 30, divide both sides by 2 to find s = 15.
