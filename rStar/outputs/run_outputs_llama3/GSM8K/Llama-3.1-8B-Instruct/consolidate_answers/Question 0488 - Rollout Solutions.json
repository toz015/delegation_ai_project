Jana has 27 puppies. First let's find out how many of them are Pomeranians. We can do that by finding 2/3 of 27. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 27, we get 2 * 27 / 3 * 27. Dividing the numerator by 3, we get 54. Since 27 goes into 27 once, 27 times 1 is 27. Thus, we get 54 / 27 = 2. Now we know that 2/3 of 27 is 18. But what are we looking for? We want to find 1/3 of the pomeranians. So if 2/3 is 18, then 1/3 would be half that. Half of 18 is 9. Now we divide 18 by 3 because of the problem saying we need to multiply 18 by 1/3.
