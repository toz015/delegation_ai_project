Condition 1: 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.20 in total. Condition 2: The price of one lollipop is $0.40. Question: What would be the cost of buying 10 lollipops and 10 candies?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. According to condition 1, we can know that the price of 4 candies is $3.20 - (5 x $0.40). That means it costs $3.20 - $2 = $1.20 for 4 candies. Therefore, we can calculate the price of one candy: $1.20 / 4 = $0.30 per candy. Now let us find out the cost of buying 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The total amount for the lollipops is 10 x $0.40 = $4. And the total amount for the candies is 10 x $0.30 = $3. The sum of these costs is $7.

It also says that 5 lollipops cost 2 dollars. To find out the cost of 4 candies, we need to subtract 2 from 3.20. 3.20 - 2 is 1.20. This means 4 candies cost 1.20 dollars. Since it costs 1.20 dollars for 4 candies, we can say that 1 candy costs 1.20 / 4 = 0.30 dollars. Now that we know the cost of 1 candy and 1 lollipop, we can multiply the amount of lollipops or candies by their respective prices to get the total price. We want to buy 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The total price will be (10 * 0.40) + (10 * 0.30). 0.40 * 10 is 4 and 0.30 * 10 is 3. 4 + 3 = 7.

First we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. We know from condition 2 that the price of one lollipop is $0.40. Using hint 1, we can calculate the cost of 5 lollipops which is $2. Since it is the same price per lollipop, the cost of 10 lollipops will be double this amount, so 2 * 2 = 4 dollars. Also using hint 2, we know that the price of 4 candies is $1.20. We can use the same logic to calculate the price of 10 candies. It will also be double the original price, so 1.2 * 2.5 = 3.00 dollars (hint 2 didn't include 2.5 but actually 2.5 or 10/4). The price of 10 lollipops is 4 dollars and the price of 10 candies is 3 dollars. The answer is: 7.0. \n\nI hope you enjoyed these examples!
