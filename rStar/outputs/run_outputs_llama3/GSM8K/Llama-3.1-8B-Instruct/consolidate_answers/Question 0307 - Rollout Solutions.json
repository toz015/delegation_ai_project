We already understand the problem with the current interpretation of the hint.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, let's find out how much weight he loses per week, first. That's 8 divided by 4, which equals 2 pounds per week. But the key here is actually that Joey loses less than Sandy because he takes longer. Let's forget what the hint said and think about how many weeks it will take for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since we want to compare their progress over equal periods of time, let's calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds. To lose 8 pounds, if Joey takes 4 weeks, we want to find out how long it takes Sandy to lose half as much weight. That would mean Sandy also loses 2 pounds every week.
