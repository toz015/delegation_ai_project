To find out how many students are in class B, we need to set up a proportion or divide to see what number comes out when we multiply it by 18 equals 90. We can divide 90 / 18 = 5. We know this because 18 x 5 is 90! Then if we multiply 25 (the amount of people in B) times the amount it takes for every 18 in A to equal 5, we get the answer. 25 * 5 = 125.
