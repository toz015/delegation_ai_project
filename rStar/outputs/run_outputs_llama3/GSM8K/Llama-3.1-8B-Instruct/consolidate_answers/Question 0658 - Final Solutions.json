Let's call the cooking time of pork 'p', the cooking time of rice 'r'. We know p = r + 20. Since beans cooked in half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can say b = (p + r) / 2. But since p = r + 20, we can substitute this into b = ((r+20)+r)/2. This simplifies to b = (2r + 20) / 2 which simplifies further to b = r + 10. The question says b = (p + r) / 2 so we can also say (p+r)/2 = r + 10. As p = r + 20, we can say ((r+20)+r)/2 = r + 10. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get (r + 20) + r = 2(r + 10).

To find out the cooking time of beans, we need to add the cooking times together and divide by 2. That is 30 + 50 = 80. Dividing 80 by 2, we get 40. So it takes 40 minutes to cook beans. We add up all these numbers: 30 + 50 + 40. 30 + 50 is 80. Then 80 + 40 is 120.
