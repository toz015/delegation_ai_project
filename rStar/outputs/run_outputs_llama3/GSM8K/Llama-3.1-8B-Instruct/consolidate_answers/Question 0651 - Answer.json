{"id": 651, "problem": "Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.\nHer total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.\nIn the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.\nThe total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.\n#### 2100", "gold_answer": "2100"}
