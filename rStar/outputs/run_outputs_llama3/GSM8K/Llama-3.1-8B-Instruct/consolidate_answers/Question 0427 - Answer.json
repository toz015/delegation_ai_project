He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150\nHe sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100\nThe cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3\nHe started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150\n#### 150", "gold_answer": "150"}
