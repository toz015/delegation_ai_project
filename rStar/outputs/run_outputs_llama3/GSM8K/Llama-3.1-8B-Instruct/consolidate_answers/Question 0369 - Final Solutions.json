It costs $4 extra per frame. The total cost of this would be 44 * $4 = $176. Together these add up to $880 + $176 = $1056.  Next we have 2 seniors receiving $5 pins, which adds 2 * $5 = $10. Then there are the officers who get cords. We know that 1/4 of the 44 seniors are officers. That means there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Therefore 11 * $12 = $132.
