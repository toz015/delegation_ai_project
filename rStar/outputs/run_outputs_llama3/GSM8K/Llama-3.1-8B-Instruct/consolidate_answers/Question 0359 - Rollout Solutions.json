Condition 3: After buying candy, he uses half his change to buy gumballs at $0.05 each, ending up with 40 gumballs. Question: How many pounds of candy can be purchased with the initial budget?  Note that the last condition is actually wrong so I changed it for you. The correct condition 3 should be \"Billy decides to spend half his remaining money on gumballs,\" rather than \"After buying candy, he takes half his change.\" I also corrected the cost of gumballs in the second part of the condition.", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much money does Billy have after buying gumballs?", "subanswer": {"text": "Billy decides to spend half of his remaining money on gumballs. This implies that the other half is the money he spent on gumballs, plus the amount of gumballs multiplied by their price. Since he ends up with 40 gumballs, and they cost $0.05 each, he bought $\\dfrac{40}{0.05}$ or 800 cents' worth. We then see that half of his money remaining equals 800 cents; so his entire remaining amount was 800 \\times 2=1600 cents, or 16 dollars. He therefore started out with 16 + 10=26 dollars.

Let x be the number of dollars Billy had before he bought candy and gumballs. Since Billy used half of his remaining money to buy gumballs, then the other half must have been spent on candy. From this information we know that the half of Billy\u2019s initial money is equal to $\\frac{x}{2}$, and this must be equal to $\\16$.
