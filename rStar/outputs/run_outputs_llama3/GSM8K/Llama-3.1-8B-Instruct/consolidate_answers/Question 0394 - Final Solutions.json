Let's say the original amount was X. Double would be 2X, and 20 more than double is 2X + 20. From the hint, we are led to understand that since there are 36 boxes in the 6 rows and 6 columns, that is double the original amount of books, and X must be 18 because 18 x 2 equals 36.

First, let's calculate what double is for the number of books. Double the number of books would mean multiplying the original number of books by 2, which is 2x. Then add 20 to get 2x + 20. To solve for the number of books needed, we'll first use another fact from the problem: since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, then the number of boxes or book spaces is 6 x 6 = 36. This tells us that x equals 18 because x multiplied by itself (or squared) would also result in 36 if you square root both sides: sqrt(36) = sqrt(x^2). When you square root both sides, both sides cancel out, leaving you with sqrt(x^2) being 6. Finally, squaring both sides again shows that x was indeed 6 * 6, hence 18.
