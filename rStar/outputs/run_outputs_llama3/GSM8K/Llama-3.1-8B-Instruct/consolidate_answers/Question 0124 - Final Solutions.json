To find this out, let's calculate what fraction of the original stack was stamped: 30 / 90 = 1/3 (from Condition 2). Let x equal the number of unstamped letters.

The unstamped letters plus the stamped ones makes up the whole so let's use this fact to our advantage. Let X represent the number of unstamped letters. The equation would look like this: X + 30 = 90. Solving for X we get: X = 60. The result tells us that out of the original 90 letters, 60 don't need any postage. As a fraction that equates to 2/3. And therefore, since we know 60 is 2/3 of the total and 90 represents 100%, the fraction of letters that do need postage, or 1/3, can be calculated by doing 90 * (1/3) which is equivalent to saying (90 / 3) = 30.

Since Jennie applied postage to 1/3 of them and we know that 30 letters remain unstamped, it means that these are all of the unstamped ones. This is 2/3 of the letters. If 2/3 = 30, then 1/3 = 15.
