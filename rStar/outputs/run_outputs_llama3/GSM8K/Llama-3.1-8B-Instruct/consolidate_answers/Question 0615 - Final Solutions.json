The first thing we need to do is determine the cost of all the different things that Scarlett purchased.\n\nFirst, let us consider the aquarium. It cost $10.\n\nNext up, the two bags of rocks. They cost $2.50 each. Therefore, we get the cost of two bags as 2 * $2.50, which is $5.\n\nThen, there were the three pieces of coral that cost $2 each. The total for the coral would therefore be 3 * $2 = $6.\n\nAfter that, we have the twenty fish. Since they cost $0.50 per fish, the total is twenty times $0.50 or $0.50 * 20 = $10.\n\nLastly, she buys fish food for $2.00.\n\nNow that we know the cost of every individual thing, we can add them together to find the total. Adding $10 (the aquarium), $5 (two bags of rocks), $6 (three pieces of coral), $10 (twenty fish), and $2 (fish food) gets $33 total spent.
