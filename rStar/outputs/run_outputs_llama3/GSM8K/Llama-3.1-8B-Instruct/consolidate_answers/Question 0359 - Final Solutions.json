We know he bought 40 gumballs and each one cost $.05. Multiply .05 by 40, this gives us 2.00 dollars (or $2). He took half of his change and spent it, meaning he spent half of $8 ($4) on gumballs. But he spent $2 on gumballs, not $4. Therefore, the remaining $2 must have come from half of the change from the candy he purchased. Half of the original 8 dollar change is indeed 4 dollars.

Billy starts with 10 dollars. Let's call the amount of candy he buys 'x'. That means he spent x * 1.5 dollars on candy. So he has (10 - x * 1.5) dollars left. After spending half of his remaining money on gumballs, he spent $(10 - x * 1.5)/2 * .05 dollars. We can call this (10 - x * 1.5)/10 dollars. This is because .05/2 = .025 and 1/.02 = 50, so we multiply .025 * 50 to get .0250 or 1/40, but to make sure we're not dividing by zero, let's express it as (10 - x * 1.5)/10000 (since 10000 * .025 is 250 and 250/250 is 1). We'll subtract this from (10 - x * 1.5)/2 to find out how much he has left.

Since he used half of his remaining cash to purchase gumballs, which cost him $7, he was left with $7. We know that Billy ended up with 40 gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. Therefore, he paid a total of 40 \\cdot 0.05 = 2 dollars. This means he had 7-2=5 dollars left before purchasing any candy. So Billy initially spent $16 and thus $16-$10=$6 came from his own money. We will now determine the amount of candy he bought using the hint. $$\\text{Number of units} = \\frac{\\text{Total Spent}}{\\text{Cost per Unit}}$$ $$\\text{Number of Units} = \\frac{\\$6}{\\$1.50}$$. $$\\text{Number of Units} = \\$4$$.
