First we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. It takes Wayne 4 minutes to get there. Bernadette's trip is 4 times longer (Condition 3). So Bernadette's trip takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes. We know Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes earlier than Wayne at the theater (Condition 1), which means she can't just leave any time after Wayne. She needs to account for both her own travel time and the extra time needed for her to arrive early. Since she needs to arrive 5 minutes prior and it takes her 16 minutes to get there, the latest she could depart is 11 minutes before she would want to arrive at the theater. However this doesn't consider the fact that we're comparing departure times, not arrival times. If we look at it from the other perspective, if Bernadette leaves 5 minutes after Wayne, she'll arrive 5 minutes later than Wayne since it takes her 16 minutes to get there vs. Wayne's 4 minutes.
