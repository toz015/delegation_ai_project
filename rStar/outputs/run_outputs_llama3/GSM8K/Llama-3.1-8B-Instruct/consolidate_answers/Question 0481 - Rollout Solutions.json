Let's assume the 1959 penny weighs 100%. Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the 1959 penny, it weighs (3/4) * 100% = 75%. It is 3/4 or .75 as a decimal. This means it is three-quarters of 100%, which is 75%. But this can't be right, because it says it is 75% instead of just saying it is three-quarters. I will convert it into a fraction: 3/4 or .75 is equal to three-quarters. Three-quarters is the same thing as .75. But you could also say it is 75 percent, if you want. .75 is equal to 75 percent. Therefore, if the 1959 penny weighs 100%, or one whole unit, the 2010 penny weighs .75 units. This doesn't make sense though, because .75 is less than one, so it would weigh less than the 1959 penny!
