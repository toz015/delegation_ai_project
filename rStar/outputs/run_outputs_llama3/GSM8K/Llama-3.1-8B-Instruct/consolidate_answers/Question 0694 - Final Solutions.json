There are a total of 57 people going (42 adults and 15 babies). But we don't need the number of babies. We need the number of chairs, which can accommodate these 57 people. To find out how many regular chairs there are, let's figure out the ratio of high chairs to regular chairs first. Let H represent the number of high chairs and R represent the number of regular chairs. Then we know that the ratio is H : R = 1 : 5. Or we can say that H = 1x and R = 5x. And since H + R = 57, we can solve for x. We substitute our values into this equation. So it becomes: 1x + 5x = 57. This simplifies to 6x = 57. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 9.5.
