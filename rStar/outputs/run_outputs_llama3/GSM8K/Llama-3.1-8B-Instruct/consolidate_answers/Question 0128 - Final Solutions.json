With that information, we can determine the total value of each item and add them up together. Since there are four watermelons, the cost would be 4 x 45 dollars. That is equal to 180. With twenty-five peppers costing fifteen dollars each, this comes out to be 20 x 15 = 300. Lastly, ten oranges are being purchased at forty dollars each, making the total value 10 x 40 = 400 dollars.

We're told that each pepper costs 15 dollars. That means p = 15. So a watermelon costs 3 * 15 = 45 dollars. And an orange costs 45 - 5 = 40 dollars. Now we need to multiply these prices by the quantity of each item and add them together. For the watermelons, 4 x 45 = 180. For the peppers, 20 x 15 = 300. For the oranges, 10 x 40 = 400.
