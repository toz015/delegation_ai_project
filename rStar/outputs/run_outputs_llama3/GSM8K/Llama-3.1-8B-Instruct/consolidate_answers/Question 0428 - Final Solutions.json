Later, all 40 got an extra hot dog, meaning they needed a total of 72 + 40 = 112 hotdogs. To find how many new guests did not receive an extra hot dog as planned, we calculate 40 - 18 (new guests minus original 18 guests), which equals 22, then check how many hot dogs the original 18 guests that were supposed to eat 2 would add if they kept eating 2. We take the first 18 and multiply by 2, getting 36. Since the total needed was 112, subtracting those 36 from the needed 112 results in 76. That is what we needed for the new guests to have one more, because 18 plus the additional 22 makes 40 total. So there were indeed 76 needed. The answer is 22. However, since there are 40 total and the original 18, that only leaves us with 22 new guests added, not actually how many did or didn't get an extra hotdog, we realize we have already found our solution. We know the original 18 who ate two each accounted for 36 out of the 112 total hot dogs. Therefore, the remaining guests, who are the 22 newcomers, had an additional hotdog to account for the last 76 of the 112. Thus, those 22 were indeed able to get the additional hotdog.

Let's go back to our initial thought about how many of the 22 wanted an extra hotdog - which is all of them! If we take away the fact that they got the extra hotdog (which is not part of the conditions, but rather what happens after), then we simply do not know if any of them would not be able to get the extra hot dog, as per the problem statement.
