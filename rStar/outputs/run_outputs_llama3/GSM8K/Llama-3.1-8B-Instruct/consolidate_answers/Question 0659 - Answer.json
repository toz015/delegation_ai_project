How much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\nOne-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.\nA one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.\nSo, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.\nAnd 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.\nTherefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
