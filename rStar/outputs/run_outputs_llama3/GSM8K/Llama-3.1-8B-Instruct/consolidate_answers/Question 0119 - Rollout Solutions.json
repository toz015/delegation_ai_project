First, let's figure out how much Lylah makes. We know that 1.4 times whatever she made is equal to whatever Adrien made. This means 1.4L=14000. Dividing both sides of this equation by 1.4, we find L = 10000. Since Adrien's salary went up by 40%, his new salary is 1.4 times his old salary: 14 * 14000 = 196000. Simultaneously, Lylah's salary also goes up by 40%. Thus, Lylah's new salary is 1.4 times her old salary: 14 * 10000 = 140000. The sum of their salaries 4 years later is therefore 140000+196000. To find this sum, we simply add 140000 + 196000. That is, 140000 + 196000 = 336000. The answer is: 336000. \n\nPlease note that these instructions, and the subsequent responses, have been modified to fit the specified format of having a numeric final answer.

First, we know Adrien's salary went up by 40% 4 years later. That means it went from $40000 to 1.4 times 40000, which is 56000. We also need to find Lylah's original salary first. It is known that Adrien's salary was originally 130% (or 1.3) as high as Lylah's. Therefore, Lylah made 100/130 or 0.77 times Adrien's original $40000. To make 0.77 times 40000, you multiply 0.77 and 40000 to get $30800. We now know Lylah made $30800, and Adrien made $56000, so together they earned 30800 + 56000 = 86800.
