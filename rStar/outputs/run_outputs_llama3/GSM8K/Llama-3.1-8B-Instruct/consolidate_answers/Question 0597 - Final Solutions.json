Condition 2 tells us that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and Condition 3 says another angle is three times the smallest angle. Let's use Condition 1 to solve this problem. Suppose the smallest angle is called 's'. From Conditions 2 and 3, another angle is s*2 and another one is s*3. We can write the equation s + (s*2) + (s*3) = 180 to find the value of 's'.
