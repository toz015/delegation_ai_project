First, let's figure out how many cookies Suzanne made. Let us say josh made j cookies. Since Josh made 1/4 of what Suzanne made, Suzanne made 4j. Because Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh, kelsie made 2j. We know that the sum of josh and kelsie made was equal to four j (the number of cookies suzanne made), so we can write this as an equation: j + 2j = 4j, which is equivalent to 3j = 4j, so 1j = 4j / 3. We also know that Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so j = 1/4 * 4j, or simply j = j. This is true because j must equal j, but we can see that j equals 4j divided by 3. Therefore, j = 4j / 3. Multiply both sides of this equation by three to get rid of the fraction: 3j = 4j. Next subtract 4j from both sides: -j = j. Now add j to both sides: 0 = 2j.
