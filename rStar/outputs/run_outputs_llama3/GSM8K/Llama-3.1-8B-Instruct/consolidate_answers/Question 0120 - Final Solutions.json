We can conclude that using the information given that 2 pads are used every week and each pad contains 30 sheets.

Condition 1: 2 pads of paper equal one week's worth of paper usage. Condition 2: Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. Condition 3: The question asks about monthly consumption. Question: In a given month (which likely consists of four weeks), how many sheets of paper does Miguel use? ", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many sheets of paper does Miguel use per week?", "subanswer": {"text": "Condition 2 states that a single pad of paper equals 30 sheets of paper, so we can start with this piece of information. It also tells us that 2 pads equal 60 sheets. But it only asks for weekly consumption. Since we know that 2 pads (which would last 2 weeks) has 60 sheets, we divide by 2. 60 / 2 is 30. However, the prompt asked for weekly usage but based off what we've calculated, a week and a halfs usage, which we have labeled as 2 weeks. Therefore, if Miguel uses 30 sheets in 1.5 weeks, then we need to find out how many sheets he uses in just a week. To figure this out, we take 30 and multiply by (7/7.5). Multiply by 7 in order to get rid of the denominator, and then divide by 7.5 to cancel out the multiplication. We'll perform the calculation now: 30*(7/7.5)= 28. Multiply by 7 first, 210. Then divide 210 by 7.5, and we get our answer. 28. The answer is: 28.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many sheets of paper does Miguel use in a month?", "subanswer": {"text": "We already determined that Miguel uses 28 sheets of paper per week.
