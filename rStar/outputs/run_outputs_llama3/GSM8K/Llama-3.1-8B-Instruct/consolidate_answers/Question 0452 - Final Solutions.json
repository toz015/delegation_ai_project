To find the total distance traveled, we first need to multiply the speed (in miles per hour) by time (in hours). This is because distance equals speed multiplied by time (d=s*t), so d=60*2=120 and d=30*1=30. We add the distances together to get the total distance, which is 120 + 30 = 150 miles. Now we use the same formula, but solve it for speed this time. This will look like s=d/t, or s=(total distance)/(total time). We know the total distance was 150, so we can plug that in. Also, the total time is 3 hours because 2+1=3. Therefore, s=(150)/(3)=50.

From condition 2, it seems that the distances covered are 60 miles (at 60mph) and 30 miles (at 30mph). But this contradicts the hint which states that the correct distances are indeed 60 miles and 30 miles. However, since this is the correct interpretation of the problem given condition 1, let's proceed with calculating the total distance. Total distance is 60 miles + 30 miles = 90 miles. Let's find the total time from the two parts of the trip: 2 hours plus 1 hour. That is a total of 3 hours. Average speed equals the total distance over total time. Therefore, 90 miles / 3 hours = 30 mph. This result does match the second condition when properly read as 60 miles and 30 miles. Thus the overall average speed is indeed 30 miles/hour.
