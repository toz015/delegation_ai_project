First, calculate his weekly pay without the bonus. Condition 1 tells us Watson works 50 hours a week. Condition 2 says this costs him (or rather earns him) $10/hour. So we can multiply those numbers together to find out how much he makes a week before any bonuses, or 50 * 10 = 500 dollars. Since there are four weeks in April (Condition 4), we need to multiply 500 by 4 to get 2000 dollars as his regular weekly income over 4 weeks. However, we also know from Condition 3 that he gets an extra 300 dollars per week if he meets his targets, so we multiply 300 by 4 to get 1200 dollars. Adding these together, we get 2000 + 1200 = 3200 dollars. That is not correct because it ignores the 500 dollar bonus mentioned in the hint. According to the hint, therefore, his total earnings for April would be 500 (his regular weekly pay) + 1200 (the bonus for meeting all performance targets) = 1700 dollars.
