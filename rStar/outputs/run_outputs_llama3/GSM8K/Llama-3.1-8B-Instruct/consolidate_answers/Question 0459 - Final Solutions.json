The total weight of everything except what fits in one trip is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds. To make the problem easier, let's first calculate how many trips it takes if he carries this much per trip. We know this much stuff weighs 3400 pounds. That means it can be fit into 3400 / 2250 = 1.51 trips. However, since you cannot make half of a trip, the farmer needs to make 2 trips for this load alone. Next, we add the remaining items (the sugar cubes) and see if their weight forces another trip. These 2 pounds can also go in the same trip because 2 < 2250. So the farmer actually needs to make only 2 trips to transport all the feed.

We already know that sugar cubes weigh 2 pounds and carrots weigh 48 pounds. To find the total weight of hay, we multiply the weight per bale (75 pounds) by the total number of bales (42). This gives 75 * 42 = 3150 pounds. Similarly, we calculate the total weight of oats by multiplying the weight per sack (65 pounds) by the total number of sacks (20), which equals 65 * 20 = 1300 pounds. Adding up the weights of sugar cubes, carrots, hay, and oats, we get 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3400 pounds. Finally, since each trip can carry 2250 pounds, the number of trips required would be 3400 / 2250 = 1.511 (rounding down would not be accurate because if you send 2250 pounds one day, you still have another 150 pounds the next, making it 2 trips).
