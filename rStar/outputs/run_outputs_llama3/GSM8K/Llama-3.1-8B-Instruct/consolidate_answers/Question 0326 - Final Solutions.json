Therefore, these two stops resulted in a net gain of 1 additional person because 8 - 7 = 1. However, since this net gain is accounted for before reaching the second stop, we can simply consider the original statement of people being on the bus at the start and those additions as the main variables in our calculation. Given this, let x represent the number of passengers on the bus before any stops. When considering the addition of 5 people at the first stop and the overall outcome of the sequence of events, the problem directly informs us that after all adjustments, the total number of people on the bus equals 20. By establishing this relationship: x + 5 + 1 = 20, we can simplify and find that x + 6 = 20. To solve for x, subtracting 6 from both sides results in x = 14. Therefore, the answer is 14.

We need to go backwards to find out how many people boarded the bus initially. The last thing we know is that when the bus reached its 3rd stop, there were 20 passengers. Before this, no new passengers got on. So we can ignore everything past the 2nd stop because nothing changes until the 3rd stop. By the second stop, 7 exited and 8 joined. That means by the 2nd stop, there were (20) - (8) + (7) passengers. This simplifies to 19. Before that stop, 5 people got on. So the total was 19 - 5 = 14 people.
