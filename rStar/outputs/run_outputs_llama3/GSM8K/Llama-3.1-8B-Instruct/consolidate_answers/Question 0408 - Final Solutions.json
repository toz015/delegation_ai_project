We know how long it takes to read the book and how much time Toby has before leaving for the airport. To find the time advantage, we need to subtract the time needed to read the book from the remaining time. 60 minutes (time before leaving the house) - 30 minutes (reading the book) = 30 minutes. However, since the question asks about the advantage being 'earlier' upon arriving at the airport, not before departing, and since Toby will spend 10 minutes getting to the airport after reading the book, the actual difference we want is 30 - 10 = 20 minutes. The answer is: 20.  I could get this value from simply subtracting 10 instead. \n\nLet me re write the code based on what you said.\n```python", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

There are 200 words per page and the book is 45 pages long, so the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. If Toby reads at 300 words per minute, he will need 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the book.
