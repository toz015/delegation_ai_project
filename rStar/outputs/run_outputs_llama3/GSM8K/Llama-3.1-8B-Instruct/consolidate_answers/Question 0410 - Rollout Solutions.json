One pound is $3, and one pound is 1/2 off, which is 1/2 of 3 dollars or 3/2 dollars. In order to add these together, convert 3/2 to an improper fraction by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2, which results in 6/2 = 3. Then change 3 to 6/2 as well. Since the denominators now match, we can add the numerators (which are 3+6=9) and keep the same denominator (which is 2), resulting in 9/2. Converting back to a mixed number, 9 divided by 2 equals 4 remainder 1, or 4 1/2 dollars. So she pays 3 dollars for one pound and 4 1/2 dollars for the other pound. To find out how much she paid in total, multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds she purchased: 3 * 2 = 6 + 4.5 = 10.5 dollars.

Let\u2019s break it down further: When Sally buys two pounds of taffy, she is getting a 0.5-pound discount, but she still pays for the whole two pounds. However, what she really got for her money was like 1.5 pounds worth of taffy, considering the half pound is essentially free.

However, the second pound actually contains only half a pound of new taffy, so it\u2019s effectively a half-pound discount which doesn\u2019t add any extra cost. Therefore, we just consider 2 pounds at the original price without calculating the discount, which would normally confuse people into overpaying. To buy 2 pounds of normal priced taffy without the promotion would indeed mean paying twice. However, due to the nature of the deal, she\u2019s getting essentially half of what she paid for in the second pound. Thus, it remains that if 1 pound was $x, you pay $2x total for 2 pounds.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  How much money does Sally have left?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Sally starts with 10 dollars. To calculate the cost of taffy, we need to find the price of two pounds first. One pound costs 3 dollars. Half a pound is half-off, or 1.5 dollars. Since these two pounds together form a whole pound and a half, we take the average of their prices: (3 + 1.5) / 2 = 2.25 dollars. Sally buys 2 pounds of taffy for 2 * 2.25 = 4.50 dollars. This leaves her with 10 - 4.50 = 5.50 dollars. Next, she buys a mixed bag of seashells for 1.50 dollars and 4 magnets that cost 4 * 0.25 = 1 dollar. Subtracting this total from what she has left results in 5.50 - 2.50 = 3 dollars remaining. The answer is: 3.", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
