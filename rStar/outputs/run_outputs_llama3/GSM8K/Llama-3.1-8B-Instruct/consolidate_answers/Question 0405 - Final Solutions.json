First we need to determine how many sandwiches are needed. We divide the total number of people (which is 20) by the number of people one sandwich can serve, which is 4. This is 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese, we'll need 5 pounds of meat and also 5 pounds of cheese. Meat costs 7 dollars a pound and cheese costs 3 dollars a pound. So we multiply 5 pounds of meat by 7 dollars a pound, which gives us 35 dollars for the meat. We multiply 5 pounds of cheese by 3 dollars a pound, which gives us 15 dollars for the cheese. Adding these together, we get 35 + 15 = 50.
