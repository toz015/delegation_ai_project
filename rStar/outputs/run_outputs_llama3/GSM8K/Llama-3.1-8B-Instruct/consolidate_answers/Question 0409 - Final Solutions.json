First, we know that there are 40 employees originally. Then 25% or 1/4 of them were laid off in june. That means 1/4 x 40 = 10 employees lost their jobs. Therefore, the remaining number of employees who stayed working throughout the entire 2-month period is 40 - 10 = 30 employees.\n\nSecondly, since every employee worked a 40-hour week at $15 an hour, the weekly pay for each of them is $15 * 40 = $600.\n\nLastly, as there are 30 employees who worked for the full 2 months, so their combined bi-weekly pay would be $600 * 30 = $18,000. Since there are 2 months, therefore the total pay for both months will be 2 times of the bi-weekly pay, which equals to 2 * $18,000 = $36,000.

Since each employee works 40 hours at 15 dollars per hour, each employee makes 15 * 40 = 600 dollars per week. To find out how much all employees made in one month, we multiply 30 employees by 600 dollars per employee: 30 * 600 = 18000 dollars.
