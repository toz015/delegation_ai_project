{"id": 689, "problem": "Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.\nSo four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.\nThus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.\nTen lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.\nTen candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.\nHence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.\n#### 7", "gold_answer": "7"}
