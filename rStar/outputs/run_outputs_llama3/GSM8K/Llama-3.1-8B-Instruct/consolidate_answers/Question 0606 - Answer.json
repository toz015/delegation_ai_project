{"id": 606, "problem": "Every 2 miles a car drives the tires rotate 725 times.  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire needs to be replaced?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles\nThat means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations\nSo the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months\nThat means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years\n#### 6", "gold_answer": "6"}
