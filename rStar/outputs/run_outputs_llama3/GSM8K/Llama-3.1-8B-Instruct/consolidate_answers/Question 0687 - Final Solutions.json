First, let's put what we know into an equation. We know one of the twins is t years old. That means the other twin is (t + 7) years old. The triplet who is younger is x years old. Therefore the older triplet is (x + 7) years old. When you add up all their ages, it adds up to 44. This gives us the following equation: x + x + 7 + t + t + 7 = 44. Simplify this and combine like terms. 2x + 14 + 2t = 44. Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation. 2x + 2t = 30. Divide both sides of the equation by 2. x + t = 15. Remember, x + t is the sum of the triplet's and the younger twin's age. To find out how old the twins are, we need to figure out how old the older triplet is. Since the sum of all the triplet's and both twin's ages is 44, then the older triplet is 44 - (sum of the triplet's and the younger twin's ages).

Since we established earlier that there are two sets of twins/triplets, and one set consists of two people, while the other set consists of three people, the total number of individuals is 5. We also know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If the triplet is X years old, then the twin would be X + 7 years old. Because the other twin would also be X + 7 years old, we get 3X + 21 = 44. Subtracting 21 from both sides results in 3X = 23. Dividing both sides by 3 gives X = 23/3 which isn't a whole number; therefore, we can't use this approach. Instead, let's try solving the problem with integer solutions. Since there are three distinct ages among the children, we should look for possible combinations of those ages. Let's go back to the initial idea and break down the ages. Assuming one triplet is 'y' years old, then another triplet would be 'y' years old, and a twin would be 'y+7' years old and the other twin 'y+14'. However, given this setup, finding integer solutions remains challenging. Looking closely, it appears that we should focus on setting up equations based on their combined ages. Given that there is only one triplet, and two twins, let's express this as equations. The sum of the triplet's age 'T', the first twin's age 't1', and the second twin's age 't2' equals 44: T+t1+t2 = 44. Additionally, t2-t1 = 7. These two equations provide us a system to solve the ages. We can substitute t2 = t1+7 from the second equation into the first equation: T+(t1)+(t1+7) = 44. Simplify the first equation to obtain: T+2t1+7 = 44. Next subtract 7 from both sides of the equation, yielding: T+2t1=37. From the initial data provided, we can observe that the sum of their ages must be odd since there is only one female (triplet) and two males (twins).

In Question 5.2, we realized that we can't find a valid solution for Y. Our analysis in Question 5.1 was incorrect in its final conclusion. The correct way to approach this is to realize that one triplet is X years old. Another triplet is also X years old. The older twin is X + 7 years old, and the younger twin is X + 14 years old. Because we are told their combined age is 44, we can write an equation based on this information. The equation becomes X + X + (X + 7) + (X + 14) = 44. Combine like terms: 4X + 21 = 44.
