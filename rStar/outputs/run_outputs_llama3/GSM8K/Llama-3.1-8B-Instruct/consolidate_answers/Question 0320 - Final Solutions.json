To multiply 3/4 by 40, first divide 40 by 4 which is 10. Multiply 10 by 3 which is 30. Therefore, 30 people remained. We also know that 22 men stayed. Let's see how many women stayed. 30 people stayed in total and 22 of those were men. So the number of women can be calculated as follows: women = 30 (total number of people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed). Therefore, women = 30 - 22 = 8.
