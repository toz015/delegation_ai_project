We want to find out what her speed is in Mb/hour. First, we need to convert Mb to kb. According to condition 1, 1 Mb is 1000 kb. This means 1 mb / h is 1000 kb / s * 3600 s / h = 3,600,000 kb/h. Therefore, to convert Ashley\u2019s speed from kb/s to mb/h, we use her original speed in kb/s (20), multiply it by the conversion factor to change seconds to hours. Ashley\u2019s speed is 20 * 3600 = 72,000 kb/h. Dividing her rate in kb/h by the conversion factor of 1mb / 1000kb, we get 72000/1000=72 Mb/h.
