Each correct question earns 3 points, and each incorrect question earns -1 point. If she completes 10 questions, gets 7 correct answers, and got 3 wrong answers, what would be the final score? Question 6.1: How many points will she earn if she answered all questions correctly? Answer 6.1: If she had answered all 10 questions correctly, she would get 10 * 3 = 30 points. The answer is 30. Question 6.2: How many points will she lose due to the wrong answers? Answer 6.2: She lost 3 * (-1) = -3 points from the wrong answers. The answer is -3. Question 6.3: Now we can answer the question: What would be her final score? Answer 6.3: She earned 7 correct answers worth 7 * 3 = 21 points and lost 3 points from the wrong answers, resulting in a net gain of 21 + (-3) = 18 points. The answer is 18.
