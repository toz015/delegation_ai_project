Let B represent the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold, and J represent the number of duck photographs on Jamal's phone. From condition 1 we know that J = 6B. From condition 3, we know that J = 1800. We also know that 50J = B (condition 2). To find out the number of pictures on Brittany's phone, we first need to determine the number of duck photographs on Jamal's phone (J) since we already know that value. J = 1800. From condition 1, we know that B = J/6. Using the information that J = 1800, B = 1800 / 6 which equals 300. The answer is: 300.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Substitute the values into the equation 50J = B. In our case it becomes 50 * 1800 = 300 which is incorrect; it was meant to show how to calculate the value of B, but then use B to find the actual number of ducks. However, this is actually correct because B is not needed directly, instead 50J is. Therefore, we take the value of 50J = B and put 50 * 1800 for B which results in 90,000. We don't actually care about the number, just that 50J = B leads us to use the fact that 50 * J = B to find out what J represents. Since B is replaced by 50 * J, and then compared to 300 which is B, it means that 50 * 1800 is being compared to 300 incorrectly.
