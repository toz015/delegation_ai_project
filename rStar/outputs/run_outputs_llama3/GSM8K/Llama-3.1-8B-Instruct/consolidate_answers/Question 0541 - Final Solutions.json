Since we know Elvis' goal and want to know how much he needs to save per day during the second half of April (which is 7 days), let us calculate how much he saved in the first half of April. First we'll determine how much Elvis saved in the first half of April. We know that the second half of April must be double the savings goal of the first half. Let x be the first half's savings goal, so the second half's savings goal would be 2x. And since the total goal is 1125, then x + 2x = 1125. Solving the equation, 3x = 1125. Dividing both sides by three, x is equal to 375. Therefore the second half of April must be twice the first half, which means 375*2 or 750 dollars needed to be saved over 7 days. Therefore if elvis wants to save the sum of 750 dollars within 7 days, he will need to save 750/7 = 107.14.

We know that Elvis wants to save $1125 this month. Let's assume he saved X dollars during the first half of the month. Since his savings goal doubles in the second half of April, he needs to save 2X dollars during the second half. To reach his target, the sum of savings from both halves must equal his monthly target: X + 2X = 1125. 3X = 1125. Divide both sides by 3: X = 375. Now we know that Elvis needs to save 2 * 375 = 750 dollars during the second half of the month.

Elvis wants to save $1125 all together. To find out how much he needs to save per day in the second half, we first need to know how much he saves in the second half. We know that he doubles his savings compared to the first half. Let's call the amount in the second half X. If he doubles it, then it equals $1125. Therefore X = $1125 / 2 = $562.50. In order to get to this amount in the second half, we just found out he also has to save this amount in the first half, since he doubles it later. We already knew he would save $1125 - $562.50 = $562.50 in the first half, which confirms our previous assumption that the value of X is correct. So if he is going to save $562.50 in the second half, we divide this by 15 (since it is the second half of april and there are 30 days in April) and get $37.50 as the daily savings needed.
