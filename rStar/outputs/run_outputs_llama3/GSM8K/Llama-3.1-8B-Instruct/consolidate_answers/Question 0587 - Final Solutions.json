Adding these up will equal 3.99B, so 3.99B = 4500 (since that is the total number of jelly beans). Dividing both sides by 3.99, we find that B = 1131.31. However, jellybean count cannot be a decimal value so this means that the problem does not have integer solutions, but the closest number would be 1131 blue jellybeans. Since 0.99B represents red jellybeans and 1.01B represents green jellybeans, we plug in our values. This will result in 1111.11 red jellybeans and 1141.41 green jellybeans. Therefore the difference between the number of green jellybeans and red jellybeans will be 30.30, however again jellybean count can't be a decimal value.

", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many blue jellybeans are in the jar?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let B denote the number of blue jelly beans. We know that the number of green jelly beans equals B + 1% * B = 1.01B and the number of red jelly beans equals B - 1% * B = 0.99B. The sum of these equals 4500, or 1.01B + 0.99B = 4500. So 2B = 4500, meaning that B = 2250. The answer is 2250.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many green jelly beans differ from the red ones?", "subanswer": {"text": "To find the difference between the numbers of green and red jelly beans, subtract the number of red jelly beans (0.99B) from the number of green jelly beans (1.01B).
