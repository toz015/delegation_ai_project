And Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and luge 2 times, meaning he also rode a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Given the information about total ticket usage per ride, it will be easier to just sum up all their rides since both of them had an equal number of rides. So if they both made 6 rides, then together they rode a total of 6 + 6 = 12 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, they used a total of 12 * 6 = 72 tickets.
