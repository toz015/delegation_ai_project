Let's call the unknown height of the shortest tree H. Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, we can write an equation: H + 5 = 11. Solving this equation will tell us that H = 6. But we already knew that. The third condition tells us that the tallest tree's height equals twice the sum of the heights of the other two trees. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall and the second tree is 11 feet tall, their combined height would be 17 feet. Twice that would be 34 feet. Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.
