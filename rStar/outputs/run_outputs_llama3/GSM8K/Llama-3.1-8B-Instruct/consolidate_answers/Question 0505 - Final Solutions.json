We also know that we need to make as many sticks as possible. To find this out, we should see what combination of x and y adds up to the most. We can only guess if we do not try every possibility. So let us look at the equation 4x + 6y = 24. First, we solve for one variable. We start by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. That makes 2x + 3y = 12. We could divide it again but then things might become difficult to understand. Instead, let us subtract 2x from both sides. That leaves us with 3y = 12 - 2x. Now we divide both sides by 3.

Since we know that 2x4s yield 200 popsicle sticks and cost $4, and that 2x8s yield 400 popsicle sticks and cost $6, we want to maximize the number of popsicle sticks while staying within our budget. First, let's find out how many popsicle sticks can be made with a single dollar, based on either piece of information, and compare them to find the most efficient option. A single 2x8 (costing $6) makes 400 popsicle sticks. That's $6/400 popsicle sticks or 0.015 per stick. A single 2x4 makes 200 sticks at $4. That's $4/200 popsicle sticks or 0.02 per stick. The 2x8 is cheaper per popstick ($0.015 vs. $0.02). So Frederick should spend all of his money on 2x8s. With his $24, he could purchase 24 / 6 = 4 2x8s. The 4 2x8s would make 1600 sticks.

According to condition 1, we get 200 popsicle sticks per dollar if we buy only 2x4s (at a rate of 1 2x4/100 popsicles), and 400 popsicle sticks per dollar if we buy only 2x8s. Let's calculate the maximum amount of popsicle sticks using both options. Option A: Buying only 2x4 lumber would result in us having 4 pieces of 2x4 (because 24/4=6). Using condition 1, this means we could have 4*200=800 popsicle sticks. Option B: Buying only 2x8 lumber results in us having 4 pieces of 2x8 (because 24/6=4). Using condition 1, this means we could have 4*400=1600 popsicle sticks. This option is clearly better than option A. Therefore, the most efficient way for Frederick to purchase woods is to purchase 4 pieces of 2x8 lumber, which costs him 4 * 6 = 24 dollars.
