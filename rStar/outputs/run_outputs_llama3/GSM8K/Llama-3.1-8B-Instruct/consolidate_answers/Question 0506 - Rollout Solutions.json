This means no matter how many dogs there are, the answer to this question depends on the fact that you cannot give a specific number unless we know the number of dogs. However, in order to follow your request, I'll answer it as if there was enough information to solve it correctly: Let's assume that Mario has a certain number of dogs (n). Condition 1 states that each sled dog has 4 legs. But since this condition isn't about dogs or how many are there but rather the characteristics of a dog, it can be ignored when answering your prompt. Condition 2 states that each dog needs one pair of snowshoes for $12.
