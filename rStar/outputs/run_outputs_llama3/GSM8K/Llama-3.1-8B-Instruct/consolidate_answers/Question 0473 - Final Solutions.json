To calculate what percentage of the shark's body length this is, we first need to determine what fraction of the shark's body length the remoras occupy. The shark's body length is 120 inches. The remoras' length is 12 inches. So, the fraction is 12/120 which can be simplified to 1/10. This fraction represents the portion of the shark's body length taken up by the remoras. The next step is to express this as a decimal or percentage. A decimal is obtained by dividing the numerator by the denominator, i.e., 1 divided by 10 equals 0.1. However, since the question asks for the answer in percent, we need to multiply the decimal by 100 (e.g., 0.1 * 100 = 10%). Therefore, the remoras take up 10% of the shark's body length.

Benny saw a 10-foot shark. Since we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 10 feet into inches by multiplying it by 12. So 10 feet would be 10 x 12 = 120 inches. Two 6-inch remoras attached together would add up to be 6 + 6 = 12 inches. We need to find the combined length so 120 inches (shark) + 12 inches (remoras) equals 132 inches.
