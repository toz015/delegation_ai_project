This implies x = $150 / ((2/3) * $1.5). Solving for x, we find x = 300. The answer is 300. However, since x includes the cards Kenny kept, x should equal 300 + (1/3)*300 = 400. The answer is 400. The initial solution was wrong, so I re-solved this problem. I found the correct answer to be 400 because if Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards, then he sold 2/3 of the cards, earning 150 dollars after paying 100 dollars for the ticket and having 50 dollars left over. If 2/3 of the cards equals 300 cards, then 1/3 of the cards would be 150. The sum of both fractions would be 450, but the question states Kenny starts with 1/3 of the cards being 150, meaning he starts with 450 cards. The answer is 450. I got 2 answers above, 400 and 450. But the correct one is not any of these. Because when solving the equation $(2/3)x \\cdot$1.5 = $150, 300 is the correct answer; however, 300 represents the cards that Kenny sold, not the total number of cards. If we multiply 300 by (2/3), we get 300, which is the correct representation of the cards Kenny sold. To get the total number of cards Kenny started with, we need to divide 300 by 2/3 or do the inverse operation, which is multiplying 300 by 3/2. Doing so, we get 450. However, we still don't know if the answer is correct yet. To verify our solution, let's plug it back into the original problem statement. Kenny kept 1/3 of the cards. He starts with 450 cards. So, Kenny kept 1/3 * 450 = 150 cards. That means he sold 450 - 150 = 300 cards. We previously stated that the 300 cards represent the cards Kenny sold. Let's multiply those by the price per card and see what we get. Kenny sold 300 cards for 1.5 dollars each. Therefore, we get 300 * 1.5 = $450.
