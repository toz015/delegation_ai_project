Let's call the cooking time of pork 'p', the cooking time of rice 'r'. We know p = r + 20. Since beans cooked in half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, we can say b = (p + r) / 2. But since p = r + 20, we can substitute this into b = ((r+20)+r)/2. This simplifies to b = (2r + 20) / 2 which simplifies further to b = r + 10. The question says b = (p + r) / 2 so we can also say (p+r)/2 = r + 10. As p = r + 20, we can say ((r+20)+r)/2 = r + 10. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get (r + 20) + r = 2(r + 10).

Let x represent the number of minutes it takes to cook the rice. Cooking the pork took x + 20 minutes. Combining these numbers together results in (x) + (x+20).
