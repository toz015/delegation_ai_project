{"id": 619, "problem": "Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights. If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, calculate the total number of functioning street lights if 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, the total number of poles having street lights is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24\nSince each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights, the total number of streetlights in all the poles is 24*4=<<24*4=96>>96\nIf 20 streetlights from the total number are not working, the number of functioning street lights is 96-20=<<96-20=76>>76\n#### 76", "gold_answer": "76"}
