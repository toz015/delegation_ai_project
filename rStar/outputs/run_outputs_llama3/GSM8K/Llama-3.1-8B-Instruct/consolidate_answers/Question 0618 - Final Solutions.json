There are 72 seats in total (Condition 3). Condition 2 says one-fourth of the seats were taken by administrators. That would be 72 / 4 = 18. Now we know 18 were taken by administrators. Condition 3 tells us the remaining seats were divided into thirds. Two-thirds went to the students. 72 - 18 = 54 seats remained. To find out how many seats the students took, multiply 54 by 2/3. This can also be written as 54 x 0.66... or 54 * (2/3) = (54*2)/3 = 108/3 = 36. Therefore, 36 seats were occupied by the students.
