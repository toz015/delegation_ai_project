Those 9 children each have 3 babies, making a total of 9 x 3 = 27 babies. However, the problem asks for great grand-babies, meaning the question asked about the third generation from Great Grandma Jones herself! To answer that, we use our first bit of knowledge that Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, each having 3 children, for a total of 9 kids! Now, to get the final count of babies, let's consider what the children themselves also have! There are 9 children from before, and they now have 9 * 3 = 27 children of their own! That answers the problem. The answer is 27.  However, I notice that the prompt said the baby was born within the last generation! Therefore, the correct answer should be 27*3=81, because if there were 27 kids then each kid had 3 kids of their own. However, let me try a different way to solve this one: The original prompt says each of the grandchildren has three babies, but does it really? No, it doesn't say that; it says \"And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own\". Therefore, in order to answer the question correctly, you cannot assume that each of the 27 grandchildren that we determined earlier has three babies of their own. This makes no sense, since we were told nothing about those 27 people. However, there are 27 grandkids that each have 3 kids of their own. Therefore, to find the answer, simply multiply 27 (number of children) by 3 (number of grandkids per child), which gives us an answer of 81. Another reason I could make this calculation is that 27 kids times 3 children/kid = 81, but this would be wrong, since those 27 kids we calculated aren't even present yet. But we can calculate the answer another way using another piece of information. We have been told that there are 27 grandchildren, and therefore, since we know there are 27, we may multiply that by 3, but again, we'll get the wrong answer. However, we can also use another piece of information: the prompt says that the 27 children are the ones that have 3 children of their own, or rather, that the 27 children have children.
