According to condition 1, Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so in total, there are 34 + 22 oranges. That makes 56 oranges. \nAccording to condition 2, they plan to share these oranges among themselves (Sitti and Juris) and their 6 other friends. This means there will be a total of 8 people sharing the oranges (Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends). To find out how many oranges each person gets, we need to divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (8). \nSo, 56 \u00f7 8 is 7.
