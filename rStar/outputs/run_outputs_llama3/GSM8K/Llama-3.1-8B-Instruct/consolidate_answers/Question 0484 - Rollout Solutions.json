Therefore, he paid 0.4 * 10 * 60 = 240 dollars. However, we should find out what he lost. In other words, we need to figure out how much would be if he didn't eat those 24 oranges. The correct way to think about this is to realize that since he pays 10 dollars per orange, eating 24 oranges costs him 24 x 10 = 240 dollars. If he hadn't eaten any, Stetson wouldn't have spent any money at all, which means he \"lost\" 0 dollars had he not eaten any oranges. Therefore, the actual loss is simply the cost of eating 24 oranges. This can also be found by subtracting the payment for the oranges that were not eaten from the payment for the oranges that were eaten. That payment for the uneaten oranges is (1-0.4)*10*60=360 dollars. Then we can determine his actual financial loss by finding the difference between these numbers, i.e., 360-240=120.
