That means each sneaker costs 576/48 dollars. 576 divided by 48 is 12. This means each sneaker cost 12 dollars. He sold 17 of these shoes for 20 dollars each. So the total amount of money he made from this is 17 times 20. 17 times 20 is 340. Next, he sold the other 31 shoes for 25 dollars each. So the total amount of money he made from these sales is 31 times 25. First calculate 31 times 25. 31 times 25 is 775. Add both numbers together. 340 + 775 is 1115. He spent 576 dollars on sneakers.
