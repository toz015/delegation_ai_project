First we need to figure out how much energy the AC uses in one day if it runs for 8 hours. Energy usage is power times time (in hours). Power is 900 watts. Time is 8 hours. So the AC uses 900 * 8 = 7200 joules or watt-hours of power in a full day. Then, the AC only runs 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. Finally, 7200 / 3 is 2400 joules or watt-hours. The answer is: 2400.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: Over 30 days, what amount of kilowatts of electricity would be saved?", "subanswer": {"text": "In 30 days, with an 8-hour operation, we consume 7.2 kWh/day * 30 days = 216 kWh. With an operation of 3 hours a day, we consume 2400/1000*30=72 kWh. So the difference is 216 - 72 = 144 kWh. The answer is 144.   Note: To calculate the yearly savings, one should multiply this number by 365, as there are about 365 days in a year. This yields 52440 kWh/year. This is equivalent to 52.44 MWh/year, or 52.44/1000=52.44 MW/year, or 5.244e+5W / 1000 J/W/s = 52440 MJ/s. As we know that one Watt is one Joule per second, 52440 MJs/s is equal to 52440 J/s, or 52440 W, or 52.44 kW. Hence, in terms of peak electric load reduction, the air conditioner's presence reduces our maximum demand by 52.44 kW.", "value": 0.75}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
