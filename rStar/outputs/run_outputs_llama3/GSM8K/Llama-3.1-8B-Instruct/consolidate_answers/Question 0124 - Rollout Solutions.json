Since there are 30 stamped letters after applying postage to one third of all, there must have been 30 * 3 = 90 letters that existed in the first place. But we know Jennie only needs stamps for 60 letters (Condition 1). That means 30 out of those 90 letters didn't need postage. Therefore, 90 - 30 is 60. This confirms Condition 1 as true. However, it does not directly tell us how many of these 60 letters actually needed postage. To find this out, let's calculate what fraction of the original stack was stamped: 30 / 90 = 1/3 (from Condition 2). Let x equal the number of unstamped letters. We can write the following equation because we know the unstamped letters plus the stamped letters make up the whole: x + 30 = 90. Solve this equation for x to determine the number of unstamped letters. Subtracting 30 from both sides yields x = 60. Therefore, 60 / 90 = 2/3 of the original 90 letters didn't need postage.
