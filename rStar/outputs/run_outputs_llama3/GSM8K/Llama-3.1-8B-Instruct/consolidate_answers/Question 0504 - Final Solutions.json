We can determine the price of all packs except the 2 packs of strawberry. The total cost of these 3 packs is $7. The total cost of the 2 packs of strawberry plus the 3 other packs is $7. Let 's use C to represent the cost of one pack of strawberry gum. Total Cost is 2 * C + 2 + 1 = 7. 2C = 7 - 3 = 4. 2C = 4, so C must equal 4/2 or 2. So each pack of strawberry must be $2.
