In those 19 minutes, they would cover the same ground they've already covered, which is 19 minutes / (6 minutes to the corner + 13 minutes) * distance from the beginning to the end or simply 19 minutes / (19 minutes) * distance from the beginning to the end which is equal to the distance from the beginning to the end. This simplifies down to the distance between these points. They covered 6 minutes worth of ground in 6 minutes, and 13 minutes worth of ground in 13 minutes. We know that they have been traveling for 19 minutes total. This means they traveled for 13 minutes of their full trip, and 6 minutes worth of ground in the first part of their journey. To figure out what distance this represents, we divide the number of minutes by the number of minutes per unit length of the path. Since they have been walking for 13 minutes, and took 13 minutes to get to the fire station, we can say that this is all of their path. Therefore, they have walked the entire path for 13 minutes. The speed is the distance divided by the time taken. However, we're looking at how long it takes to travel a certain distance, not how fast you go. So instead of using the formula d = rt, we should use the inverse t = d/r. Unfortunately, we don't actually need to find the distance because the question asks us how much longer they have until they get there, rather than what distance they'll be past. If they normally reach the school after 30 minutes but they're halfway done, then they've got half as much time left.

Assuming the rest of the journey back is equal time to the journey from the library, the entire journey would be 19 minutes (6 + 13), making half of it 9.5 minutes to get from the fire station to the library, so the whole second leg will take 13 + 6 = 19.
