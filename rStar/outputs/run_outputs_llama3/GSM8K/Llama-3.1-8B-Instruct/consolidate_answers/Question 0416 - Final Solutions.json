We know that there are 304 bumps and that x camels will contribute x*2 = 2x bumps and that y dromedaries will contribute y bumps. Thus, we know that 2x + y = 304. Furthermore, since we know the total number of animals, we know that x + y = 180 / 2 = 90, because there are 180 heads which implies 90 animals. Solving the system of equations above, we get 2x + x = 304 - y, 3x = 304 - y, x = (304 - y) / 3, substituting into x + y = 90, we have ((304-y)/3)+y=90, multiplying both sides by 3 yields 304-y+3y=270, we add y to both sides which gives us 304+2y=270, subtracting 304 from both sides we get 2y=-34, then dividing both sides by -2 we obtain y=-17, however, y must be positive, therefore our initial assumption about number of camels being x must be wrong. Thus let's call number of camels z instead and proceed with solving the system again. Solving the system with y + z = 90 and 2z + y = 304 results in 3y + z = 394 and -y + 2z = 214. Multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3, we obtain 6y + 2z = 788 and -3y + 6z = 642. Adding these two equations together, we get 8z = 1430. Dividing both sides by 8 results in z = 179. Since we assumed z to represent the number of camels and got a positive number, our substitution was correct. Finally, substituting z = 179 into y + z = 90, we get y + 179 = 90, thus y equals 90 - 179 = -89, which again can't be true. However, if we assume z to represent the number of dromedaries, then we would have the following equations: z+y=90, y+z=304/2=152.
