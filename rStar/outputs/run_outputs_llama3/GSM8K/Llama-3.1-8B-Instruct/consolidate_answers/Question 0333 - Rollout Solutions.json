Robert needs to calculate the costs of both options. Let's look at them one by one. Furniture United has an initial cost of $1350 and then six additional costs of $350 each. First, we add $1350 and $350 which equals $1700. Next, we need to find out how many times we can multiply this sum by six. We have six payments left, so we simply need to multiply it by six once: $1700 * 6 = 10200. This is our total for the furniture. For comparison, let's go over the other option too. Cozy Homes starts off with $1100 and then adds nine payments of $250. First, we need to add $1100 and $250 together which gets us $1350. To determine how many times we can multiply this result by nine, we just multiply it by nine since there are nine more payments: 1350 * 9 = 12150. Our goal was to find out the price difference. Therefore, we subtract 10200 from 12150 which equals $1950.
