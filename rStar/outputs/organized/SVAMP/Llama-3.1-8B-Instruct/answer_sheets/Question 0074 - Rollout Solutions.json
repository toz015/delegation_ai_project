A total of 351 students suggested adding only bacon. We also know that a total of 218 students suggested adding both mashed potatoes and bacon.

This means 218 students' suggestions are being counted twice because they wanted bacon too. But we don't want it doubled, so we need to find out just how many people in total said \"Bacon\" and subtract off 218 because those people also said mashed potatoes. Therefore, to get the correct count for just bacon, we can take the group who suggested both (218) away from the group who suggested just bacon (351). This would look like 351 - 218.
