We know that they made a certain amount from selling the jerseys, but we also don't know how many jerseys were sold. However, we do know that they sold 158 t-shirts and 2 jerseys, so let's find out the total earnings from selling t-shirts. Condition 2 says they earn $204 per t-shirt sold. Multiply this amount by the total number of t-shirts sold (158) to get their earnings from t-shirts. This will be 204 x 158 = 32152. We're told they sell each jersey for $76.
