First, we find out how many chairs are needed. There are 9 sets of tables. Each set needs 14 chairs. 9 x 14 = 126. To determine how many chairs they have, we don't know yet. So let's just keep it as a variable. If you look at your code again, you can see this. After all the sets of chairs are put together, I'll come back to this later. So let's say they have x amount of chairs. x - 126, since they have fewer chairs than required. To solve for the difference between chairs and tables, that means subtracting 126 from whatever amount of chairs we decide they have later. But we still don't know what x equals. However, the instructions tell us to give a numerical value as our final answer. This doesn't make sense because x isn't defined or something. I made a mistake. Let me think of a new solution. 9 sets of tables need 9 x 14 = 126 chairs. We don't know how many chairs they have.

Since we already know the number of chairs needed is 126 and it exceeds the actual quantity (that we are trying to find), let us call the unknown quantity as 'x'. Since there are 9 tables, we can write 9=x. That would mean there are 9 tables. Since there are 9 tables, then there must also be 126 chairs, according to the problem statement. This would imply that they indeed have enough chairs but we still need to find out how many more chairs they have than the number of tables. To get this value, we subtract 9 from 126.
