In order to get the final answer, let's go back to the prompt for Question 5.5 and see if we actually need to do anything else. Yes we do! The problem asks us to \"Calculate the amount of money they made in all\", which implies we should be calculating the sum of money from both periods. However, we are told that we've been given 2 periods of data (the first 44 days and the remaining 10 days). Since we were also told that these 2 pieces of information would allow us to determine the answer to the overall question, we could simply add 382 + 374 to arrive at our solution, but there isn't enough information in the prompt to tell us whether or not that is allowed. The prompt does say however that we can use the information about how much they made over the 10 day period to calculate the overall amount, implying that using one number and another number doesn't satisfy this requirement. We are trying to find the total income of the ring toss game, so we will want to look at the numbers given and try to figure out how to use them. The prompt tells us that the ring toss game made 382 dollars in the first 44 days and 374 dollars in the remaining 10 days, so we will combine the two periods and then divide by 54 days to arrive at our solution. This isn't going to work though, because the prompt states that the answer can be determined from the 2 provided values alone. This means we cannot divide by anything other than 1 or use any additional information. We are given two different periods of information, and we're asked to determine the amount of money they made in all. If we add the money they made during the two periods, we'd be using both of the provided numbers and adding them together, rather than doing some form of calculation with either number separately. Since we're looking for the final total, we'll simply add the money they made during the two periods of time and give that value as our response.

To find out how much it made per day on average for the first 44 days, we need to divide the amount earned during those 44 days ($382) by the number of days (44).
