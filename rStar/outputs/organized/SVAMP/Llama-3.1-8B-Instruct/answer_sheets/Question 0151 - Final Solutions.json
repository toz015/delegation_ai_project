That's why the direct computation is presented here instead of describing intermediate steps explicitly as done in other cases. The process of computing 5440 * 32 involves breaking down one or both factors into easier parts (e.g., 5440 into 5400 + 40) followed by multiplying these easier numbers together along with the second factor. These easier multiplications can then be combined to obtain the final result.\n```python\n# Define variables\ngardens = 10\npots_per_garden = 544\nflowers_per_pot = 32\n\n# Compute total number of pots across all gardens\ntotal_pots = gardens *", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
