We need to consider Nell starting with 246 baseball cards and gaining some when she gets them from Jeff as well. To figure that out we need to follow condition 1, which says she started with 246 baseball cards. However, we still don't know how many more baseball cards she gained since it was not specified but it can be found if we add how many baseball cards she ended up with and subtract what she initially had: 404 - 246. 404 - 246 equals 158. To determine how many she got from Jeff, simply use the subtraction of how many baseball cards she had initially minus the number of baseball cards she had initially plus how many baseball cards she acquired later: 246 + (number she received from jeff) = 404 so the amount of baseball card received from her was 406-214=171.
