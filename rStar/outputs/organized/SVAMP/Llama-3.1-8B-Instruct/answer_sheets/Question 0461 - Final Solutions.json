Mary had already used 2 cups of the required 12 cups of flour. So we still need 12 - 2 = 10 cups of flour. Since the problem asks us to compare it with the amount of salt which is 7, we just need to tell how much more flour is needed compared to the salt. 10 > 7 so we need 10 - 7 = 3 more cups of flour compared to the amount of salt.
