Paul originally had 71 books. He bought 38 more so now he has 71 + 38 = 109 books. We don't know how many he sold yet. Since we want to find out how many he sold, let's use the information again. Let's say he sold x books. He went from 71 to (71-x) books. And then he bought 38 more books. This means that he currently has (71-x)+38 = 109.

However, the problem states he currently possesses a total of 116 books. This means he had fewer than 116 books before acquiring the 38 new ones. Thus, Paul actually started with more than 71 books. Let us try another approach considering the previous statement. If he acquired 38 books and ended up with 116, then he must have had 116 - 38 = 78 books before the new acquisitions. The information regarding starting with 71 contradicts this result. Hence we proceed with the fact that Paul had more than 71 books before he bought 38 new books to reach 116 in total. If we assume Paul had x books initially, then 71 + 38 < x <= 116 since he purchased 38 to end up with 116 or more. However, if x was more than 71 but not enough to make 116 without adding 38, then x could be one of these values: 71+1=72, 71+2=73 etc. We need to check which value of x (number of books he had before buying 38 new ones) would allow him to finish with 116 after adding 38 to the initial amount x. To find out how many books he sold during the garage sale, let us continue checking values of x until we meet the condition stated in condition 3 (which says the final count is 116). To identify which of these possible initial amounts allows him to end up with exactly 116 books after the garage sale, let's look at the numbers in order until finding a fit: 72+38=110 (too low), 73+38=111 (still too low), 74+38=112 (getting closer but still too low), 75+38=113, 76+38=114, 77+38=115, 78+38=116.
