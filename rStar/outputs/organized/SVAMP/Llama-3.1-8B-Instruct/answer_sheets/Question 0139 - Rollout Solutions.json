Given that you can't cut below 0 roses, we can safely conclude that there MUST have been fewer than 19 initial roses in order for us to cut enough roses and still have some left. Let's rephrase the question as \"What number times 3 equals 19?\" Since we can't divide both sides of a equation by a negative number and still expect a valid answer, let's assume she didn't actually take any of the known value (as that would mean there were no roses and she just magically got 19) and instead, try to solve for \"x\" where x was some unknown number of roses that were also taken.
