We know the original amount of roses (9) and orchids (6), but we also need to find out how many orchids and roses Jessica cut. First, let's figure out how many orchids Jessica cut. If there were 13 orchids after cutting, that means she cut 13 - 6 = 7. Next, we need to find out how many roses Jessica cut. If there were 3 roses after cutting, that means she cut 9 - 3 = 6 roses. We can calculate the difference between orchids and roses: 13 (orchids) - 3 (roses) = 10. The answer is: 10. \n\nHowever, this problem doesn't follow the same steps as all the others because it requires us to not only solve the question asked but also figure out additional information that wasn't explicitly stated. But if we look closely, we see that the problem actually asks for us to calculate the difference between orchids and roses after they've both been cut.
