First we need to find out how many students there are in total in the school. Each classroom has 58 students, and there are 87 classrooms. Multiply these numbers together: 87 x 58. To multiply these numbers, let's first multiply 80 (which is close to 87) and 60 (which is close to 58). 80 x 60 = 4800. Since 87 is slightly less than 90 and 58 is slightly less than 60, our result will be a bit less than 4800 but still very close. We can subtract 700 from 4800 to make up for this difference, or just calculate it precisely if you know your multiplication tables well. 87 x 50 = 4350, and 87 x 8 = 696. Adding 4350 + 696 = 5046. Thus there are 5046 students in the school. There are 2 seats on each school bus. Therefore we will divide the total number of students, 5046, by 2. This results in 2523.
