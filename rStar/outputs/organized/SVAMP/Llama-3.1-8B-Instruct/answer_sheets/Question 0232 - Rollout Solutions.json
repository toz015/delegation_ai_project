That means we made a mistake somewhere in our previous steps. The hint said to figure out how much he spent in total before we calculate the difference between books and pens. Since he spent 16 dollars on books and 8 dollars on pens, we need to figure out how much he had originally. It is 19 + (books + pens) because the amount of money he has left plus the amount he spent is the same as the original amount.
