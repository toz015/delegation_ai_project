We already figured this out earlier as being 1493. Now, to get the total number of students in the school, we simply need to add these numbers together, so 1493 + 690 is 2183. But since you only asked about the girls, we just need the number of girls. The problem statement said there were 732 girls originally, but it didn't say anything about the boys. We also need to consider that 682 more girls joined the school. Therefore, we need to add the original number of girls (732) to the number of new girls (682), which makes 732 + 682 = 1414. However, we realized our solution was incorrect as per your instructions which require only the numeric number at the end. Let's correct this by just providing the number of girls.
