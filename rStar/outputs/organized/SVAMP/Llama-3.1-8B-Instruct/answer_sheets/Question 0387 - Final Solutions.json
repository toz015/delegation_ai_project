Since we already know the correct answer from the hint, we will skip it and go straight to finding out how many games she played. If Melissa scored 7 points per game and she scored 21 points in total. To find the number of games, we need to divide the total score by the score per game. 21 \u00f7 7 = 3. The answer is: 3. \n\nHowever, I still want you to practice your problem-solving skills as if you did not see the hint before solving this problem.\n\n21 is the total score. It is divided evenly into 7-point groups since every game scores 7 points. We start with 0 and add 7 to 0 until we get 21. We get 0+7=7, 7+7=14, 14+7=21. So we count the steps: 0+7, 7+7, 14+7.
