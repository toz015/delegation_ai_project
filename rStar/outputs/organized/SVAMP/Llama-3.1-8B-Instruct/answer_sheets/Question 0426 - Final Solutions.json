Matthew had 29 crackers. He must have kept at least 1 for himself. And he gave equal numbers to his 2 friends, so it looks like 28 / 3 would not work out evenly. So maybe we need to re-think the problem. If we consider that he kept 1 cracker for himself and gave 14 to each friend, this is possible because 28 is divisible by 14. Matthew had 30 cakes. It seems that we cannot find a solution where we divide all 30 cakes into 3 even groups of cakes, but what if we also have to divide the crackers? We know from above that we had to keep at least 1 for ourselves and divide the rest evenly, which works if we keep 1 cracker for ourselves and give 14 to each friend. This leaves 2 groups of 14, or 28 crackers. Let us see if dividing 30 cakes into 3 groups works if we also have 2 extra cakes, just like the crackers. We know that we can't divide them equally into three groups, because we'll get a remainder of one. But what if we leave one in each group? That is 3.
