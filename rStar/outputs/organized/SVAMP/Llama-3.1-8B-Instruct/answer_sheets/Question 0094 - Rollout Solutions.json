Since this equation holds true, our original equation also holds true.

First let us find out how many hours Julia played tag with each group. We know that she played with 19 kids for 1 day and 18 kids for 1 day.

But we know she played a total of 38 hours. That means 2x = 38. To find 'x', divide both sides of the equation 2x = 38 by 2. This results in x = 19. We can confirm that we calculated correctly because 19 * 2 = 38. Now that we know she played 'x' = 19 hours with 19 kids and 18 kids.

", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many more hours did Julia play on Monday?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let x be the hours she played on Monday. Since the game went for 38 hours total, then (38-x) is the number of hours she played on Tuesday. If we add the hours for both days together, we get 2x + 38 - x = 38, or x = 0. However, since x cannot equal zero, our equation is inconsistent with known facts. Instead, consider that the hours per day will be constant because both games started and ended at the same times. Then if there are 19 kids on Monday, there must be 18 kids on Tuesday, meaning Julia spent one hour longer on Monday than on Tuesday. However, we need to calculate this in a different way as well. Consider the ratio between the kids and the hours. There are 19 / 18 = 1.0556 ... kids per hour on Monday, versus 1 kid per hour on Tuesday. This tells us that we don't need the actual number of kids to solve the problem, but rather their ratio. To determine by how many kids Julia played on Monday compared to Tuesday, let's first divide the 38 hours by the 1 kid per hour on Tuesday. If there is 1 kid per hour on Tuesday, then there must be 38 kids-hours on Tuesday, i.e., 38 kids*1 hour/ kid = 38 kids-hours. Now let's do the same thing for Monday. We know there are 19 kids playing, and we want to find out how long they play for. Since there are 38 kids-hours on Tuesday, we can set up an equation, where Monday's kids play for X hours and we multiply the result by 19 kids. 19 * X = 38, because the ratio of kids-hours must be equal. Divide by 19 to find the solution for X. The final result for X equals 2. Thus, we now know that on Monday, Julia played for 2 hours. The difference in time played on Monday vs Tuesday is therefore 2 hours. But remember, our ratio earlier said there were more kids on Monday than Tuesday. Now we understand why Julia played for 2 hours on Monday. However, what about the kids per hour part of the ratio? Since we have the kids per hour ratios, we see that we should use 1 hour on Tuesday as our denominator instead of 19 kids on Monday. As we have already calculated in step 5.1, there are 38 kids-hours on Tuesday.

We know the number of hours each day (38) and the number of kids on each day (19 and 18). Since 38 / 19 is approximately 2, we can assume the same amount of time was spent per kid each day. Let's use this information to find out how many kids Julia played on Tuesday. If it takes 2 hours to play with 19 kids, then it would take 2 hours to play with 18 kids as well. This makes sense since the problem states that she played with the same number of hours each day.
