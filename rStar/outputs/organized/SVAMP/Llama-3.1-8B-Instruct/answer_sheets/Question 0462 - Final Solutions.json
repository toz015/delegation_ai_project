First we know she threw away 33. Next, we know that after throwing them away, she added some to make it 17 roses again. We don't know how many she added yet but since it went up from 0 (no roses left after throwing 33) to 17, then 17 - 0 = 17. This means she added exactly 17 more roses than the 33 she threw away. The difference is the question - 17 more roses she added - 33 that she threw away = -16. But this is wrong because we can't add a negative to find the difference. What we need is how many she added so 17 - thrown-away-roses = new_roses_added. 17 = 33 + new_roses_added. To solve for new_roses_added, subtract 33 from both sides, which leaves us with new_roses_added = 17 - 33 = -16. So we know she added 17 roses back to reach 17, meaning 17 - 33 is not the correct way to find the answer; instead, use 17 = 33 + new_roses_added to find out the number of roses she added.

There were 15 roses originally, then 15 - 33 = -18 roses. Then, she added 17 roses, making it 17 - 18 (which should be calculated as 17 + 18) = -1. However, I believe the question wants us to figure out how many roses she needed to add, not how many she had after adding or removing roses. Since she ended up with 17 roses, she needed to add enough roses to make up the difference between 17 and the 15 original roses. We know that when you do an addition problem and want to find how much extra you need for something, we subtract instead. So, 17 - 15 = 2 roses needed to be added from her garden.
