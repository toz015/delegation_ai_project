Since we can't watch 19 movies since there are only 10 movie options, we know we didn't watch all 19. We must have read them instead because you can't read more movies than are available! So we read 19, but if you count all the movies you get 8 (because there are 10 options) + 19 = 27 movies would have been read/watched (but that is wrong so it means it was the books that were not 19!) if all the books were 19 this time and none were watched instead 27-8=19 which is the number of books!

We want to find out the difference between the number of movies and the number of books in the series. First we need to know how many movies and books are in the series. According to condition 1, the series contains 8 books and 10 movies. Next we need to find the difference between the total number of movies and the total number of books you've consumed (read or watched). According to condition 2, you have read or watched 19 books and 61 movies. Subtracting the total number of books from the total number of movies, we get 61 - 19 = 42. However, this result tells us about your movie-to-book ratio, not the movie-to-book ratio within the series itself. Since both the book count and the movie count of the series itself is known, all we have to do is subtract the smaller value from the larger one, which results in: 10 - 8 = 2. Therefore, the crazy silly school series exceeds by 2 more movies than it does books.
