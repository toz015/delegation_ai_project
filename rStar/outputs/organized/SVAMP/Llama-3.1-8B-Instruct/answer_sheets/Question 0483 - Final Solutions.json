We're not interested in negative numbers here. The real task is to find out how many more crayons he lost compared to what he gave to his friends. Since we don't know how many more he lost, let's try to figure it out using the information provided in the question. Paul had 110 crayons initially. He lost 412 but he only gave away 90.

What we need to find out is the difference between 412 (lost) and 90 (given). That would be 412 - 90. To make it easier, we can subtract 90 from 400 (which is close to 412), getting us 310. Now let's add 12 to this result which will bring us closer to our original target: 310 + 12 = 322.

However, if we want to find out how many more than the 90 he actually lost (not just those he was left with), it would be the difference between the original 41 and the ones he gave away which is 41 - 90, no wait... He lost 41 but gave away 90, so we need to compare the amount of crayons lost to the amount given away which is 41 vs 90 and that difference would be 90 - 41 which equals 49.
