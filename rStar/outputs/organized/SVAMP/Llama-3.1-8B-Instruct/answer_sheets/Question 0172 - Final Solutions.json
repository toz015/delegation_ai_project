If Frank put his candies into 26 bags. Each bag has 33 candies. To find out how many pieces of candies he has, we need to multiply the number of bags (which is 26) by the number of pieces in each bag (which is 33). That will be 26 * 33. We know that multiplication is commutative so this is equal to 33 * 26. Using our multiplication fact 30 * 20 = 600 and 40 * 10 = 400, we can simplify this problem. First let us calculate 33 * 20 = 660 and 33 * 10 = 330. Since 26 = 20 + 6, we can rewrite 33 * 26 as (33 * 20) + (33 * 6). We now substitute these values in the equation above to get (33 * 20) + (33 * 6) = 660 + 198 = 858. Therefore, Frank has 858 pieces of candies.
