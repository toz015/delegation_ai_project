Now we can answer the question: Now we can answer the question: How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does Mary need to add now? Answer 5.2: First, let's determine how much sugar and salt Mary still needs in total. This will be calculated based on the fact that she started adding the ingredients without making the entire amount required yet. For flour, she needs 1 cup. For sugar, she needs 8 - 0 = 8 cups (she used none). And for salt, she needs 7 - 0 = 7 cups (she used none). Thus, in total, she needs 1 + 8 + 7 = 16 cups. As previously determined, she needs 1 cup of flour. But the problem wants the difference between sugar and salt. Given that she needs a total of 16 cups and she needs 1 of flour, the other 15 must be made up by both sugar and salt. However, the ratio between sugar and salt should remain the same. The recipe specifies 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. That is a ratio of 8:7 or approximately 1.14:1 (sugar:salt). Based on this ratio, for every 7 units of salt, 8 units of sugar are needed. Since the total they make up from the recipe is 15 cups (not including the 1 cup of flour), this is 15 * 7 / 15 = 7 units of salt per 15-cup block and 8 units of sugar per 15-cup block. 16 cups would therefore require (7/15)*16=7.46666667 units of salt and (8/15)*16=8.53333333 units of sugar.

The recipe specifies 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. That is a ratio of 8:7 or approximately 1.14:1 (sugar:salt). Based on this ratio, for every 7 units of salt, 8 units of sugar are needed. Since the total they make up from the recipe is 15 cups (not including the 1 cup of flour), this is 15 * 7 / 15 = 7 units of salt per 15-cup block and 8 units of sugar per 15-cup block. 16 cups would therefore require (7/15)*16=7.46666667 units of salt and (8/15)*16=8.53333333 units of sugar.

The ratio is 8:7, so for any given number of salt, we multiply it by 8/7 to get the corresponding number of sugar.

To find out how much sugar and salt she needs to add, we need to calculate how much of those she still needs according to the recipe. Since the problem asks us about the difference between cups of sugar and salt, let's first find out if we can answer that question based on what we know. Now we can answer the question: Now we can answer the question: How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does Mary need to add now? Answer 5.2: First, let's determine how much sugar and salt Mary still needs in total. This will be calculated based on the fact that she started adding the ingredients without making the entire amount required yet. For flour, she needs 1 cup. For sugar, she needs 8 - 0 = 8 cups (she used none). And for salt, she needs 7 - 0 = 7 cups (she used none). Thus, in total, she needs 1 + 8 + 7 = 16 cups. As previously determined, she needs 1 cup of flour. But the problem wants the difference between sugar and salt. Given that she needs a total of 16 cups and she needs 1 of flour, the other 15 must be made up by both sugar and salt. However, the ratio between sugar and salt should remain the same. The recipe specifies 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. That is a ratio of 8:7 or approximately 1.14:1 (sugar:salt). Based on this ratio, for every 7 units of salt, 8 units of sugar are needed. Since the total they make up from the recipe is 15 cups (not including the 1 cup of flour), this is 15 * 7 / 15 = 7 units of salt per 15-cup block and 8 units of sugar per 15-cup block. 16 cups would therefore require (7/15)*16=7.46666667 units of salt and (8/15)*16=8.53333333 units of sugar.
