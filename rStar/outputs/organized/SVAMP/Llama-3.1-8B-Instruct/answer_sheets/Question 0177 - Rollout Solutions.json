But we need the value of y so we divide both sides by 1 (which would turn this equation into 163Y/1=163). Divide both sides by 163. This will be 163Y /163. Which will get us Y = 163 / 163 which is 1. However, since we are looking for t-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game (not the Arkansas game), let's call the number of tshirts sold in the Texas Tech game N. N + Y = 163.
