Let's break it down step by step. First, let's figure out how many bags Tiffany had on monday. That's easy \u2013 she had 7 bags. Next, let's figure out how many bags she had in total. We know she found 12 more bags on Tuesday, so we add those to the 7 she already had: 7 + 12 = 19. The question asks us to find how many more bags she found than she had on monday, which means we need to subtract how many bags she had on monday from how many bags she had when we're all done: 19 - 7 = 12. Wait, no \u2013 we need to subtract 7 from 12, but since we want to know how many more bags she found on Tuesday compared to what she already had on Monday, we'll actually subtract the amount she already had on Monday (7) from the amount she found on Tuesday (12).
