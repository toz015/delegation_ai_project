You want me to think about how many students are taking the trip first. But let's go back to step one. We know that each bus has 3 seats. We need to divide the number of students by the number of seats per bus. That is 111 divided by 3. However this isn't exactly correct because not every class has a student going on the trip. To calculate that we have to assume that each class has at least one student. Therefore the problem states that there are a total of 111 students. 111 divided by 3 is 37.

We also know there are 111 students going on the trip. And finally, we are told that every bus can fit 3 students. We can figure out how many buses we need by dividing the total number of students by the capacity of one bus, or 111 divided by 3. That equals 37. However, since you can't have part of a bus (you have to have a whole number), you round up if you get any decimal points.

Since we know that there are 111 students in total but we don't know how many classes are going, let's assume every class goes because we need as little buses as possible so we'll say all of them go. That means there are 72 classes. Each class needs a bus since it's assumed all go, so we need 72 buses. But we also know that each bus holds 3 people, which means one bus can hold 3 x 72 = 216 people. We only have 111 people, which is less than 216, so we actually just need to find out how many groups of 3 we can make with 111. This is called division and can be represented as 111 / 3 = 37. So we can fit 37 groups into buses and still not use up the entire capacity. However, this doesn't necessarily mean 37 buses are needed, it means we've divided our problem correctly. Now if we divide 111 by 3 we get 37, and we know that there are three seats per bus so 111/3 = 37 and since 37 * 3 = 111 then it's safe to say that 37 buses are needed.
