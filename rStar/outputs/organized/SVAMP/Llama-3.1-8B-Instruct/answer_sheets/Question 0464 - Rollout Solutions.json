Since Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and we're told that Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, let's figure out what we know about Jill first. We're trying to solve this equation: x (peaches Jill has) + 9 (more than Jill that Jake has) = 7 (fewer peaches than Steven that Jake has). That means we have x + 9 = 16 - 7 = 9. Subtracting 9 from both sides leaves us with x = 0. But since you can't have zero peaches, something doesn't add up here.\n\nWe have one more way to set up our equation. We could say Jake has x peaches and has 7 fewer than Steven, who has 16, so the equation would look like this: Jake's peaches - 7 = 16. Since this is not true, let's try another way: x peaches is how many peaches Jill has and Jake has 9 more than that.
