This means that when it was just those 24 who boarded plus the original 23, we get 47. And since 8 of them ended up staying, this leaves us with 47 - 8 = 39 kids exiting. Therefore the difference in the number of children who got off (which was 39) and those who got on (which was 24) would be 39 - 24 = 15.
