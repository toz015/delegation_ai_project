However, since dividing any number by another number results in an integer or fractional quotient, you can also express the quotient as 3.0769 (which is incorrect) or simply leave it as 3, indicating exactly how many whole sets of 13 are included, but not accounting for fractional leftovers, so technically speaking, when done accurately in math, you're just left with the quotient, which doesn't take extra t-shirt packs into account. To clarify: this really should be: 3 whole packages, but then the extra t-shirts would come out of a fourth package, making it not entirely correct without adding the 4th package; however, mathematically speaking the calculation here does not allow for any more than 3 whole packages. So to sum this up correctly: you actually get 3 full packages of 13 t-shirts each, and still end up needing a few more to reach 39. Therefore, if mom buys these specific t-shirts in the described packaging method, she needs to buy: 39 / 13 = 3 packages with a remainder, meaning she only gets 3 full packages out of 13, leaving her short 6 t-shirts, hence needing one more pack to cover the extra needed t-shirts. In fact, let me rephrase it, properly answering: You will indeed need 3 packages, and then you will see how much you will be short. Since 39 divided by 13 is 3, so you have 3 full packages of 13, thus having a total of 3*13=39, therefore: 39 / 13 = 3. This isn't truly accurate, though because the result here is rounded down to 3 and it seems I incorrectly implied something wasn't needed as it implies there's no leftover. Correcting myself completely and simplifying the answer by acknowledging my mistake earlier: Dividing 39 by 13 yields a whole quotient of 3. Which could mislead into thinking you only need 3 packages. But since what happens when you try to fulfill this purchase and the math results in a quotient that's whole, we should first note, we know we can't get all 39 using only 3 packages of 13. Hence concluding we must get 3 whole packages with a remainder.
