Let's just look at this like we need to find out how many cookies pacco would have eaten if he only had 25 cookies. We already know that he ate 28 cookies but that can never happen. In real life you cant eat something that you dont have. But lets go ahead and try to come up with an answer to see if we get anything close. He had 25 cookies and he ate all of them, plus 3 more.
