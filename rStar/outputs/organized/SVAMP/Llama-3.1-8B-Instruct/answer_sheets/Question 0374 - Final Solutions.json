Randy has 37 blocks. He used 33 blocks to build a tower. So he must have had 37 - 33 = 4 blocks left over. We also know he used 13 blocks to build a house. To find the difference between the tower blocks and house blocks, we need to subtract the smallest number from the largest. Since we don't know which one was smaller, we'll have to look at the numbers. They are 33 (tower) and 13 (house). The larger number would be 33 since it's greater than 13. The smaller number is 13 since it's less than 33. The difference between these 2 numbers would be 33 - 13 = 20.
