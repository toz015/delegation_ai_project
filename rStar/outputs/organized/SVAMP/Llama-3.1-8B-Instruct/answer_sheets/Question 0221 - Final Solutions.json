To find out how much money Razorbacks made from Texas Tech game, first we need to figure out how many shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. Total shirts sold is 186, and 172 were sold during the Arkansas game. So 186 - 172 = 14 shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. Since Razorbacks make $78 per shirt, they made 78 * 14 = 1092 dollars selling shirts during the Texas Tech game.
