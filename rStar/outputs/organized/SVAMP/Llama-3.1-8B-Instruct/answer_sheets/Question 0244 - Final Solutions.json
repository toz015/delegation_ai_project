A better way to solve this problem would be that if Ed had x marbles and Doug had x-19 marbles initially, then we could solve for x. Since now Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, we know that x+(number of marbles Ed lost)=x+19-19+8. So, x-(number of marbles ed lost)+8=x-11. Therefore, 8-(number of marbles ed lost)=-11. Solving for the number of marbles ed lost gives us -11+8=-3. Finally, we know that Ed had x marbles and lost some marbles to have 8 more marbles than Doug, who had x-19 marbles initially.

At the end, they both have x marbles because, from what we've determined above, we already stated that x+19 and x represent the initial marbles of Ed and Doug, respectively. Since we want to find out how many marbles Ed loses, it must follow that Ed loses some marbles so that at the end, they have the same number of marbles. In other words, Ed has x-19 marbles initially and eventually ends up having x marbles because he has 8 more than Doug, who initially had x-19 and still had x marbles at the end. This means that 8 is the difference of the number of marbles Ed has at the beginning and at the end and the difference of the number of marbles Doug has at the beginning and at the end is 19, so they are equal. The equations that describe the situation are x+19-x=x-x+8. Simplifying these, we get 19=8, which is false. We should realize that if Ed and Doug initially had x marbles and Ed lost some marbles, then we can determine that Ed initially has x marbles and Doug has x-19 marbles because we initially stated that Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Thus, the number of marbles Ed has at the end can be expressed as x-19+number of marbles lost by Ed, where the number of marbles lost by Ed equals 19. Now, the last thing we need to know to solve this problem is the relationship between Ed's marbles at the beginning and at the end. We know that Ed had x marbles at the beginning, and now has x-19+19 marbles. Now we can set up an equation. We know that x-19+19=x. Adding 19 to both sides of the equation, we get x=x+0. Simplifying this, we get 0=0. As you see, the statement we made is not helpful because it led us to a conclusion that says nothing about anything. To sum up, what I'm trying to say is that it really doesn't matter whether Ed initially had x+19 marbles or x marbles. It just matters that the number of marbles ed lost is 19, because if he didn't lose any marbles, he wouldn't have 8 more marbles than Doug.

This implies that the number of marbles Ed lost is 19. The answer is 19. Question 5.2 may seem confusing and useless, but it helps establish the fact that if Ed initially had 19 more marbles than Doug, and now Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, the difference between the number of marbles Ed had initially and the number of marbles he has now is indeed 19, meaning he lost 19 marbles. In the previous attempt, I tried to prove that they have the same number of marbles initially, which isn't true. Instead, if x represents the number of marbles Doug has initially, then Ed also has x+19 marbles initially. Then, since Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug after losing some marbles, it follows logically that the difference between the number of marbles Ed has initially and the number of marbles he has now is the same as the difference between the number of marbles Doug has initially and the number of marbles he has now, which is 19. So even though my initial solution was incorrect, it is correct now that the number of marbles Ed lost is indeed 19, regardless of whether or not x represents the number of marbles Doug has initially or whether or not Ed initially had x+19 marbles.
