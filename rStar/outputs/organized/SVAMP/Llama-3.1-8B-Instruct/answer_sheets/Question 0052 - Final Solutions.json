If Emily can make a certain number of necklaces with the same number of beads, then she can also make one necklace with X beads. And since she made 5 necklaces with 5 times as many beads, it means that she needs the same amount of beads for each necklace. Since Emily made 5 necklaces and she used a total of 5 * X beads, let's calculate the remaining beads when she finished making these 5 necklaces: If Emily had 20 beads initially, she had 20 - 5X beads left after making these 5 necklaces. However, we are told that this situation applies to any set of 5 necklaces; therefore, we know that she used all the beads for these 5 necklaces, because if she didn't, then the relationship wouldn't hold true for any other set of 5 necklaces. This implies that the only possibility is that there are no remaining beads. We can express this mathematically as follows: 20 - 5X = 0. Solving for X, we get 5X = 20.
