But, considering that she removed some to then add others back, we interpret the removal as adding back 2, meaning she actually just removed the ones she had to replace.

That means she added 17 - 15 = 2 roses. Since she also added 34 orchids, she added 2 roses. However, the correct way to find out is to calculate the total increase of flowers and then find what percentage of that increase came from roses or orchids. To do that, let's first calculate the total increase. Initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids, now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids. The total number of flowers went from 77 (15+62) to 113 (17+96), an increase of 36 flowers. Of those 36 new flowers, 2 were roses and 34 were orchids. The ratio of roses to total flowers went from 15/77 to 17/113. The difference between these ratios represents the proportion of flowers that were roses. We need to solve the equation (17/113 - 15/77)/(1-(17/113)) = 2/36 to confirm if our initial assumption is correct or not. Simplifying the equation yields 2/(113*77/11377 - 17/113^2) = 2/36.

If we remember that initially there were 15 roses and after the change, there were 17 roses, that would mean that Jessica took 15 (initial) roses to put 15 (new) roses, because they had to be equal (the same number), therefore we subtract the initial roses from the final number of roses, which is 17 - 15 = 2. The answer is 2. The other thing we know is that we should make sure the context makes sense; if only 2 roses were exchanged and the total number of flowers increased significantly, something doesn't add up. Looking back at the context, one might think that replacing a flower implies taking it out first before putting a new one, which is why I said we needed to confirm this is what happens in our case. Since there are 62 initial orchids and the 16 additional ones that were added from the garden, there are 78 orchids after being added, not just any random increase, as one might initially suspect given the big difference in numbers between orchids and roses.
