We're told that the difference between the number of boys and girls is 142 more boys. That means that if we take the number of boys (x) and subtract the number of girls (700), we get 142. This can be written as x - 700 = 142. To solve for x, we need to add 700 to both sides of the equation. This results in x = 842.
