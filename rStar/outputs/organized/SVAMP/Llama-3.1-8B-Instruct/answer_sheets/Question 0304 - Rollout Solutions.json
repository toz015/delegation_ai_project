This results in $19 being his earnings. However, looking back at the problem statement, it seems like he got a loan or borrowed $9, which changed his amount from $86 to $105. Thus, his earnings would be the change in his amount: $105-$86=$19. But, this doesn't match with what is provided in the condition; therefore, looking again at the statement, it says his new earnings amount to $19, however it says from $86+$9.

Let's break it down. We know that last week Fred had 86 dollars and Jason had 5 dollars. But now we need to find out how much they have together now. When the question said Fred washed cars, this means he earned money. So, let's first try to figure out how much money he made. Since he went from having 86 dollars to having 9 dollars, he must have spent all his money except for 9 dollars. That would mean he lost 86 - 9 = 77 dollars. This can't be correct because it doesn't make sense that he would lose money by washing cars. A more logical approach is that we ignore what happened with Fred and instead just focus on what Jason did or didn't do. We already know Jason did not wash any cars.
