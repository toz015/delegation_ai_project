We don't need condition 1 or the second part of this problem because we already solved it earlier (Emma). We can ignore those parts since the question only asks about Emma. Therefore, we only look at the information about Emma which states she had 27 pencils and then found 17. So if we add them together 27 + 17 = 44.
