If his strawberries were not heavy enough to make up 22 pounds when alone, then adding them would not exceed 36 pounds if they're heavier. First let's check this idea using algebra, but actually we don't need to. If he had no strawberries, the remaining weight would be 22. If he had one pound, the remaining weight would be 21 etc... so as soon as you get close to 22 it won't matter. His strawberries now weigh 36 pounds and all strawberries together weigh 52 pounds.

Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds after his dad picked more, and if we add his dad's extra pick (which is 30 pounds), then the corrected initial weight is not relevant. Since his dad found 30 pounds more on the way back, but we don't know the original weights, we need the total weight after picking more to find out what was his original contribution. Since we know that after his dad's pick, Marco's weight added to his father's pick equals 66 pounds (36+30=66), we subtract the 30 added pounds from the 66 total to get the father's strawberries' final weight. So, the father's strawberries weighed 66 - 30 = 36 pounds. However, since 66 pounds includes both their original combined strawberries (22 pounds) and the 30 that his dad picked, that makes the father's original strawberries actually equal 36 (because the mother's is already included in the 66). The father's new strawberries plus the mother's strawberries weighed 66 pounds, we now know that 66 pounds contained both their original strawberries. This implies that his original strawberries weight could also be represented by 66 - the strawberries picked by the father, which is 66 - 30 = 36 pounds.
