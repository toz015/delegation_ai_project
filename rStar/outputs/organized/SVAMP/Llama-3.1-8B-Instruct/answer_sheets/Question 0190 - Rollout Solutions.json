Baker started with 43 cakes and 114 pastries. So 43 + 114 = 157 items in total. Baker sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes. That means he sold 78 cakes out of 43 original ones (so we can ignore this part) but 154 out of 114 pastries. Let's focus on the latter as we're comparing pastries to cakes. First we find out how many pastries were not sold. This would be 114 - 154 = -40 pastries. However, because you cannot have negative numbers (we don't know what that would mean), it implies that baker didn't actually make so many pastries or people stole them from him. But we'll assume everything is fine. We want the difference between pastries and cakes. 154 (pastries) - 78 (cakes) = 76.
