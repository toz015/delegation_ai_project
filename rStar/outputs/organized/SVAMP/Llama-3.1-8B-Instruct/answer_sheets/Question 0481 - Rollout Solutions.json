We don't know Ron's height yet but we'll start by saying it is x. The depth of the water will be 5x. Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron so his height will be (x - 11). However, since this problem asks for Ron's height, we need another equation using the information about the depth of the water. But looking closely, the question actually asked about Dean's height, not Ron's. To find Ron's height, you would need more information or a different kind of equation involving both heights. \n\nHowever, let's just continue with what we can. Using the fact that the depth of the water equals 5 times Ron's height, which also equals Dean's height plus 11 feet, we get 5x = (x-11) + 11. 5x = x. 4x = 0. x = 0. Since we said Ron's height was x, x = 0 doesn't make sense because someone cannot be zero height.
