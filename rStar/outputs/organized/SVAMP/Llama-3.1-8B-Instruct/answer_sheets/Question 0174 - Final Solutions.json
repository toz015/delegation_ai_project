You cannot have negative peaches. However, going back to Question 5.1, I made an error; however, this error led me to point out that I previously wrote \"You cannot have negative peaches.\" However, what I actually meant to say was that there might be other problems in my previous work. This being said, using logic (in the case of peaches, negative numbers don't make sense), we will rework the entire problem. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. And since Steven has 5 peaches, we can deduce that Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches. Next, we'll determine how many peaches Jill has. To do so, we first state that Jill has X peaches. Then we can say Steven has X + 8 peaches. We already know that Steven has 5 peaches, so now we set up the equation X + 8 = 5. Now we solve for X: X + 8 - 8 = 5 - 8, which simplifies to X = -3. However, we want a positive solution. Let's recalculate: The problem tells us that Steven has 5 peaches. Also, let's remember the phrase \"Steven has eight more peaches than Jill\". Since Jill has X peaches, we can say Steven has X + 8 peaches. But as mentioned earlier, Steven has 5 peaches, so X + 8 = 5. We now calculate X: X + 8 - 8 = 5 - 8, which simplifies to X = -3. However, we are looking for a positive solution. In order to find this positive solution, let's recalculate. Steven has 5 peaches. He has 8 more peaches than Jill. So Jill has X peaches. Thus, X + 8 = 5, so we can calculate X: X + 8 - 8 = 5 - 8, which is simplified to X = -3. Now we go back to what we were originally trying to figure out. We found out Jake had 2 peaches. But let's keep going with our calculations: Steven has 5 peaches. Now, we'll write X + 8 = 5. We see that we've used Jill's peaches multiple times. To simplify this, let's try something new.
