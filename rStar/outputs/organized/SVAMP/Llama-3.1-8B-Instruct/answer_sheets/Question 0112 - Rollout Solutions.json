What we really need to calculate is how many orchids remained in the vase after she finished pruning and then subtract the new amount from the old. To get the number of orchids initially in the vase, add the new amount to the unknowns that were removed: 7 + X = 13. This means that the total # of items was 16 (original roses) + X (items cut including some roses & orchids) or 13 (roses remaining after the cut), plus other stuff like X amount of orchids.
