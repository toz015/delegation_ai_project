The problem tells us we need 2 more cups of flour than sugar, which means we will need the amount of flour equal to the amount of sugar plus 2.

Since the condition tells us the amount of flour will increase by 2 minus the difference of what was initially stated between 7 and 11 (which is 4), this would be 2 + 4 = 6 more cups.
