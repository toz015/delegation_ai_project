Originally, Danny had 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers. Then he found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers. Let's see how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found by calculating both the difference between what he had and found for both items. To do this we need to add the number of each item he originally had to the number of each item he found. This will be the total amount for each item. 68 + 11 = 79 bottle caps total. 51 + 28 = 79 wrappers total. The difference between the total amount of wrappers and the total amount of bottle caps he found will show us how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found. Since both totals are equal (79), it means he found the same amount of each type of item.
