This means Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. But you cannot have negative peaches, this would mean the problem statement about condition 2 being true is wrong. Therefore, I will assume it was meant to say Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill or vice versa. Let's change it around and see what happens if Jake has 18 less peaches than Jill. The new equation becomes: Jill has 18 + 7 = 25 peaches (condition 2). Steven has 16 peaches. So Steven exceeds Jill by 25 - 16 = 9 peaches.
