We know the shop sells 106 t-shirts for every one they sell. We also know in total they sold 242. And we know 115 were sold in the Arkansas game. To find out how many shirts were sold in Texas Tech, we need to divide the total shirts sold by the price per shirt. That would be 242 / 106. This equals approximately 2.28. Since you can't buy a fraction of a shirt, this isn't what we're looking for. Instead, let's try subtracting the shirts sold in the Arkansas game.
