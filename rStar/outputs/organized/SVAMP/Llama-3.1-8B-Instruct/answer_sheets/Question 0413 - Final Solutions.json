The number of marbles he found doesn't contribute to whether he lost or gained any marbles; it just tells us he found some.

Since we already figured out Josh loses 12 marbles, that leaves us with finding 8 new marbles, which we just calculated. Now let's calculate our final answer. Josh lost 12 but found 8, so the difference is 12 - 8 = 4. The answer is: 4.  We're not done yet. Let's continue! We also need to find out the net change in the number of marbles Josh has. We calculated earlier that he lost 12 but found 8. So now we need to add those together and subtract it from his original 4 marbles. That would be 4 - (12-8). To simplify that, we can first calculate 12-8, which is 4. And then we'll have 4 - 4, which is 0. The answer is: 0.  But let's finish the last one. First, we need to calculate Josh's final marble count by using the information given in the second condition. Josh's original marble count was 4.

The answer is 8.  Wait, didn't the other part of the question state Josh ends up with -4 marbles? Yes, this problem is a bit messed up! So, while math says he ends up with -4, and Josh is clearly losing marbles, logically speaking he doesn't end up with a positive or zero amount of marbles; he ends up with nothing (since he has negative marbles!). Thus, when looking at the numbers we've been given, if Josh started out with 4 marbles and 'lost' 12 (which is 16 + 4 = all the marbles he ever had!), and he found none of them (because in reality, finding something would be considered 'gaining'), then indeed the amount of marbles lost exceeded the amount found by 12. Since he never actually had any marbles left after the initial loss, let alone found any, the correct number to use should have been the difference between what he lost and what he found; however, that difference is still based upon the idea that Josh lost something (the difference is 8) that he could only have lost IF he initially had enough. Which is not true because math has said he ended with -4 marbles instead! What can we say about this? In conclusion, since the problem asks for the number of marbles Josh LOST EXCEEDING the marbles he FOUND and we already determined he lost 16 and found 8, then it stands to reason that the correct answer will indeed be the same as calculated using the incorrect information above. The answer is indeed 8.  However, I believe that's not what the questioner wants because that doesn't account for how the numbers were used in relation to one another... We can look at it like this: in order to have a certain number of marbles, Josh had to gain some more (or else his initial amount wouldn't be the starting point). This leads us to know that 4 > -4. But, in this case, the problem statement actually IS asking the wrong thing. If I'm right about my interpretation, then we'd simply say: \"you can't gain more marbles than you started with\".
