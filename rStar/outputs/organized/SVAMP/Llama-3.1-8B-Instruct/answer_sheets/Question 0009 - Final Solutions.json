We know that 9 people left, so we just need to find out how many customers there were originally. Let's work backwards. If there were 12 customers left, before those customers left, there would have been 21 (12 + 9). To get the original amount of customers, let's think about it another way... Let's say the original amount was x. When 9 left, x-9 remained. But we already know what remained, which was 12. Therefore, x-9=12. Adding 9 to both sides of the equation we get x=21.
