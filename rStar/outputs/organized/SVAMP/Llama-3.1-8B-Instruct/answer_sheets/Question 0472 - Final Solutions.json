The question asks us to ignore this information for simplicity. \nSince this was a tricky one, let me clarify why we ignored this part. We just needed to find out if Rebecca could make groups with what she already has. Using the marbles is redundant because our goal is only focused on dividing the existing egg amount into groups of 5. Therefore, the marbles' ability to buy more eggs isn't something we need to consider within this problem context.
