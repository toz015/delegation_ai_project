There were originally 50 objects (birds + storks) on the fence. Of these, 46 were storks. So, 50 - 46 = 4. These 4 must have been birds because we know 4 were sitting there initially. This means that the initial count of birds was already correct as stated in the problem. We only need to add the new birds. Initially there were 4. Six more arrived. 4 + 6 = 10 birds.

It said \"and\" which means there are other things besides storks. There are 4 birds. This is besides storks, which are 46. There could be more, or there might not be any. But we need to get back to the question which asks how many birds are on the fence. \"And\" suggests that the 4 are birds. The 6 new ones are also birds. And maybe, just maybe there is another bird. So if you put all of those together, you get 4 + 6 + 1 = 11 birds. The answer is: 11.  You can try combining 4 birds with the 46 storks to find out what would happen if this were actually true, to see how absurd this statement sounds. (You may want to try it.)  The result would be 50 birds and 46 storks or simply 96 animals. It sounds quite ridiculous doesn't it?
