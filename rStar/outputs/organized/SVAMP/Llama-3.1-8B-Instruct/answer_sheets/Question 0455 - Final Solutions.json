But we need to get back to the question which asks how many birds are on the fence. \"And\" suggests that the 4 are birds. The 6 new ones are also birds. And maybe, just maybe there is another bird. So if you put all of those together, you get 4 + 6 + 1 = 11 birds. The answer is: 11.  You can try combining 4 birds with the 46 storks to find out what would happen if this were actually true, to see how absurd this statement sounds. (You may want to try it.)  The result would be 50 birds and 46 storks or simply 96 animals. It sounds quite ridiculous doesn't it?

Since we already solved it in the previous prompt, this response is redundant. However, I'll follow your instruction anyway. Let's assume you meant that we should find how many animals were sitting on the fence initially. 46 storks + 4 birds = 50. That was not what you asked though. You asked us to find out how many birds were on the fence after 6 birds arrived. 4 initial birds + 6 birds arriving = 10. This is also not correct based on our prompt instructions. What you actually wanted was to find the total amount of animals after 6 more birds arrived. In that case, 4 initial birds + 6 birds arriving = 10 birds. But since 6 birds arrived, there would be 10 birds. To get the total, add those 10 birds to the 46 storks. Therefore the total amount of animals (birds and storks) is 46 (storks) + 10 (birds).
