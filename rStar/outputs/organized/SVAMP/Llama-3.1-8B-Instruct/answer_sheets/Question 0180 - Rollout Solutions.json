To find out how many nails John has left after using 221 nails from the 13 large planks, we first note that the question says nothing about what John had previously. We don't know if he started with zero or an unknown number of nails. However, since you asked us to continue with a certain format, let's just say John starts with 0 nails. Using all 221 nails would mean he has 0 - 221 = -221 nails left. But that doesn't make sense, because we're not allowed to subtract more than the total we have, which is 0. Let's try another approach! Let's go back to Question 5.1. There we said that each plank of wood needs 17 pieces of nails to be secured. That's where our previous calculation got its numbers from. Since we are dealing with a fixed number of planks (13) and a fixed number of nails per plank (17), we can easily calculate how many total nails are used for the large planks (13*17=221). There's no variable here that we can change to get an answer greater than 221. However, if we combine the fact that we used 221 nails for the large planks with the 8 extra small planks' nails, then we can add those together. This is 221+8=229 nails in total. Since we're still following your specified answer format, which implies we should give an answer based solely off the information provided in the prompt, we can write: Since the question asks for the total nails, we simply add both numbers together and get 229.

First let's find out how many nails are needed in total. That would be 13 planks times 17 nails per plank, plus 8 extra. That comes to (13 * 17) + 8. We know that 13 x 17 is 221. Adding 8 to this makes 229. Next we want to determine the number of planks. To do this, divide the total nails by 17, which is the number of nails per plank. Therefore, (total nails) / (nails per plank) = (number of planks). Plugging in our numbers, we get 229 / 17 = 13.5. Since we cannot have half a plank, it seems like it is impossible to use exactly 229 nails for the 13 larger planks. However, we only calculated the number of planks if they all require 17 nails, but since not all of them might need the full 17, there can still be an amount less than 17 nails.
