So the total number of kids she played with is 32 + 2 = 34. However, the hints suggest that this is not the correct way to solve it. According to the hint, we get 17 + 15 = 32. We just need to add 2 kids to get 34. But according to the question, the answer should be 17 + 15. This seems like a trick problem since we can't add 2 kids into our equation because the answer is supposed to be 17 + 15, which doesn't make any sense when considering all three numbers. Looking back at the instructions and re-reading them again, I see that it says, \"The answer is: <ANSWER>.\" Where <ANSWER> is supposed to be a numeric number.
