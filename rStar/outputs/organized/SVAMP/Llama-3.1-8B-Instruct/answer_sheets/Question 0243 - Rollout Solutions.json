We know that Edward ended up with 3 dollars. Before this, we can say that Edward had (3 + X) dollars. Where X is some amount he spent earlier.

However, it is the problem statement which says Edward spent some money - meaning he didn't spend $10. It could be $1 or any other value lesser than $10 or even more greater than $10 but the question states he ended up having $3 so therefore he definitely must have spent a certain amount of money to get from $13 to $3.
