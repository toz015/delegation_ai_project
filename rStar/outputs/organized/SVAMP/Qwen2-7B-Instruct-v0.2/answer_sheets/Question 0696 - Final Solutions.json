To clarify our process, let\u2019s consider that her goal is to understand the total egg quantity based on creating X groups of 11. In this scenario, however, since we do not know the specific value for X (the number of groups of 11), we cannot directly calculate the total egg count from this information alone.

This oversight points to a need for more definitive details in understanding the true operation intended behind the initial query.
