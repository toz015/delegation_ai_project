The answer remains 2 because the question indirectly poses a scenario suggesting a comparison without explicitly stating the exact number exiting in relation to those entering for clarity. To align with the direct interpretation aimed for, clarifying the intent could enhance the educational value of the question and its solution. In this specific format, understanding that 82 children boarded while acknowledging the final count suggests a net effect where essentially, every child on the final count beyond the initial group arrived through boarding (including those previously accounted for or assumed to not have exited significantly affecting the overall numerical comparison), thus inherently affirming the 2 additional children as accurately representing the net increase without specifying the exit count directly\u2014emphasizing the core calculation from the initial boarding perspective relative to the intended question's implied goal of comparing entrants against total presence adjustments.
