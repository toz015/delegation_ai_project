The calculation needed is based on finding how many roses she would have had if no action took place (starting from zero), and since she started with 2 roses and ended with 23, including the initial deficit (which doesn't directly translate into the addition of roses but rather the context indicates the overall increase), we should calculate based on the end state minus the initial deficit or absence (assuming 'cut' refers to adding roses beyond what would logically be required to go from 2 to 23 without considering any removal): Starting with 2 roses, going to 23 implies additional roses cut (beyond reaching balance) to make up for the 4 thrown away and surpassing the initial count by subtracting the throwaway count and applying the adjustment logic: 23 - (-2) = 25 roses.
