The actual calculation aligns with the scenario presented where no subtraction was necessary to clarify differences between purchased and sold books based on the steps outlined. Given the sequence of events described, if one interprets the question asking simply how many books he had in the intermediate state versus the final state, the answer remains centered around the clarification note above acknowledging a potential misunderstanding in framing the query for a direct comparison between purchased and 'sold' books without additional detail in the narrative or clear instruction on the specific calculation aiming to find more books 'bought than sold'. Contextually, focusing on the actions described rather than interpreting the question to seek a comparative 'more' in book transactions leads logically to recognizing the emphasis on purchases over initial possession rather than contrasting against sales, thus illustrating the nuance in understanding the question's intent when faced with such ambiguities in narrative-based math problems. As such, with the initial calculations providing clarity that the focus lies on acquisitions over disposals as indicated in the narrative without specifying quantities traded during the described scenarios, the emphasis on Paul\u2019s actions reveals the importance of precise phrasing in questions concerning financial changes or comparisons. The answer is that Paul bought more books than he could have hypothetically sold based on transitioning from 71 books to 116 without a detailed account of sales quantity mentioned between these steps.
