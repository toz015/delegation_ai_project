The answer depends on what's asked correctly interpreted, typically when asking about splitting eggs into groups of 3, it doesn't extend the grouping to other items unless specifically mentioned or implied. Given the context implies just egg grouping, 3 groups are formed from the eggs alone. If looking broadly for all items, then it would be 23 groups across all items collectively but this isn't typical interpretation based on standard question structure.
