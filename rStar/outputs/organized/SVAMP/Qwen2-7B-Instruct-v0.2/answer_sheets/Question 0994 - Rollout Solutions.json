First, we know the total amount of color needed is 57g. It says he needs 22g of wax more than this. To find out how much more wax he needs compared to the total required (colors + wax), we can first add the total of colors and wax which would be 57g (color) + 22g (wax) = 79g. Therefore, it means that in addition to requiring 57g of colors, he requires another 22g of wax. Comparing the additional wax requirement to just the total required (colors), you subtract the colors' total from the combined total. That's 79g (total) - 57g (colors) = 22g.
