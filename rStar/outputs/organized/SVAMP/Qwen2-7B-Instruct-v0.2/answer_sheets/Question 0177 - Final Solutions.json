Based on the hint, you're trying to figure out how many t-shirts were sold specifically during the Arkansas game. Here\u2019s how we can go about it:\n\nFirstly, we know a total of 163 t-shirts were sold over two events (Arkansas and Texas Tech). \n\nWe\u2019re told they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. To determine how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we subtract the number sold during Arkansas from the total:\n\n\\[ Total\\ sold = Sold\\ during\\ Arkansas + Sold\\ during\\ Texas\\ Tech \\]\n\\[ 163 = 89 + Sold\\ during\\ Texas\\ Tech \\]\n\nTo find \"Sold during Texas Tech,\" we rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ Sold\\ during\\ Texas\\ Tech = 163 - 89 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Sold\\ during\\ Texas\\ Tech = 74 \\]\n\nSince we already knew they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we just confirmed how many were sold during the Texas Tech game as being 74.\n\nNow, to find out how much money they made specifically during the Arkansas game when selling those 89 shirts", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
