This doesn't make sense practically because you can't have negative fruit.\n\nGiven this scenario might need clarification or correction in terms of its logic, but if the intent was to determine how many peaches Jake has compared to Steven (with the understanding that '3 fewer' refers to quantity difference), here\u2019s the clarification:\n\nSince Steven has 5 peaches, and Jake has 3 fewer than Steven,\nJake has \\(5 - 3 = 2\\) peaches.\n\nSo, Steven indeed has 5 peaches under standard mathematical interpretation.
