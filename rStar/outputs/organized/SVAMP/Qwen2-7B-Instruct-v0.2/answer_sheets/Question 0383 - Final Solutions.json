Initially, Paul had 601 crayons and later ended up with 336. So, he used 601 - 336 = 265 crayons. Since he didn't lose any erasers, he initially had 406 erasers and still has all those. To find out how many more erasers than crayons Paul got initially, we compare the initial amount of erasers to the remaining crayons, which is 406 - 265 = 141. The answer is: 141.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?", "subanswer": {"text": "He has 336 crayons left, which is fewer than his initial number of erasers, or the total he got. Subtracting the number of crayons from the number of erasers gives us an excess of 406 - 336 = 70 extra erasers compared to the crayons. The answer is: 70.", "value": 0.75}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
