In this specific format, understanding that 82 children boarded while acknowledging the final count suggests a net effect where essentially, every child on the final count beyond the initial group arrived through boarding (including those previously accounted for or assumed to not have exited significantly affecting the overall numerical comparison), thus inherently affirming the 2 additional children as accurately representing the net increase without specifying the exit count directly\u2014emphasizing the core calculation from the initial boarding perspective relative to the intended question's implied goal of comparing entrants against total presence adjustments.
