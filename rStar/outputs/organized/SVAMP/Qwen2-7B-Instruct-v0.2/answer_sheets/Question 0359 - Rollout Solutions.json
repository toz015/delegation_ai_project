Let's correct it by understanding Jake has exactly 18 more peaches than Jill. Given that Steven has 16 peaches:\n\n- Jake has 16 (Steven's peaches) + 9 (since Jake has 9 fewer than Steven, which means if you add 9 to what Steven has, it equals what Jake has) = 25 peaches.\n\nTherefore, Jake has 25 peaches.
