They started off with 22 pounds together. Marco's strawberries ended up weighing 36 pounds. That means the total weight was increased by 36 - 22 = 14 pounds due to Marco's dad finding more strawberries on the way back. \n\nHowever, we know that Marco's dad actually found 30 more pounds of strawberries on the way back. To find out how many more pounds this is compared to what it would've just been based on Marco's share increasing alone, you subtract the extra amount that just came from Marco's strawberries from the total increase:\n\nSo, 30 (total found) - 14 (increase only considering Marco's strawberries) = 16.\n\nTherefore, Marco's dad found 16 more pounds of strawberries than what would've happened if only Marco's strawberries had increased by the initial 14 pounds.\n\nThe answer is: 16.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?", "subanswer": {"text": "After adding the additional 30 pounds found by his dad to the original combined weight of strawberries they collected, we calculate his dad's strawberries' new total weight.
