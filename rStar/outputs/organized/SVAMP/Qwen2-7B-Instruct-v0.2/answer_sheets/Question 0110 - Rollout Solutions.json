Let's correct it:\n\nGiven the initial conditions, if there are indeed 52 cookies in total and no candies involved in the cookie count (since only 15 candies were mentioned and their presence doesn't impact the cookie distribution), the calculation should simply focus on dividing the total number of cookies by the number of bags:\n\nTotal number of cookies divided by number of bags should be exactly divisible to indicate an even distribution without any remainder, implying each bag holds an equal share of the cookies.
