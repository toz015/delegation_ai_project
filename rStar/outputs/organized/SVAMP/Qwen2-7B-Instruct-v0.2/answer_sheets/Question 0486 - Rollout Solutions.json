Calculating this, we get 84 (total capacity of the Ferris wheel) - 16 (current riders) = 68. This implies that another 68 people could join the ride if the seats were filled to their maximum capacity. However, I made an error here in my explanation; because the calculation should be based on the number of full seats times the capacity per seat, rather than subtracting from the total capacity directly. Correctly, we would find the number of empty seats and multiply those by the number of people they can hold. Since 16 out of 6*14 possible positions are occupied, that means 6*14 - 16 = 84 - 16 = 68 potential spots for people existed before considering that the wheel may not fill every seat fully. Hence, the correct approach should focus on understanding the total potential occupancy versus actual occupancy instead of directly calculating open spots by subtraction.
