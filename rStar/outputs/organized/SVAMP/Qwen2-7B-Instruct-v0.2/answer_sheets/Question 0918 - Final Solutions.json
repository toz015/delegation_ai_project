There are 102 students who might go on the trip. Each bus can carry 8 students. So, to find out how many buses are needed, we divide the number of students by the number of seats per bus:\n\n\\[ \\frac{102}{8} = 12.75 \\]\n\nSince you can't have three-quarters of a bus, you'll need to round up because even if the last bus isn't completely full, it still counts as one. This means you actually need 13 buses to accommodate all the students.\n\nTherefore, 102 students are going on the trip. \n\nThe answer is: 102.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many buses are needed to take the trip?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since 22 students don\u2019t want to go on the trip, then 102 - 22 = 80 students will be going on the trip.
