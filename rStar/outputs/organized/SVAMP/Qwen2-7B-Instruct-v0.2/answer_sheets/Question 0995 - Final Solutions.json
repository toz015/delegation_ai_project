However, since you can't have a fraction of a flower bed filled, we need to consider the actual scenario where all seeds would ideally be utilized if fully available. In reality, based on the given information, we understand that not every seed turned into a flower due to the context suggesting that fewer seeds grew into flowers compared to what could fit per bed (implying the 58 was actually achievable with full utilization). Therefore, considering the logical approach assuming optimal outcome despite the initial miscalculation in dividing, and based on the provided data points, it's clear the intention is to directly address the total seeds and their application rather than mathematically partitioning within unrealistic constraints suggested earlier.
