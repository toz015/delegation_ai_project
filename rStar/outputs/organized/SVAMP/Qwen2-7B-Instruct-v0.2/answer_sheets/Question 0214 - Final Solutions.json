We've got a certain amount of items (in this case, white t-shirts) and we want to know how these can be divided into sets or 'packages' based on their quantity.\n\nWe start with 66 white t-shirts and every single one of those t-shirts fits neatly into a package along with 3 others. This means our task boils down to dividing the total number of white t-shirts by the capacity of each package. When you perform the division (which essentially asks, 'How many times does 3 go into 66?'), you'll find out exactly how many complete packages make up your original collection.\n\nHere\u2019s how the math unfolds:\n\n66 / 3 = ?\n\nThis operation tells us the exact number of complete packages possible when every unit fits precisely three other units next to it in each set. \n\nSo when we calculate 66 / 3, we come across the answer of 22. This means that out of your initial stash of 66 white t-shirts, you would end up with 22 separate groups, all packed beautifully according to your criterion of containing exactly three t-shirts each.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe answer is: 22", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "White t - shirts can be purchased in packages.
