However, considering your hint aimed to identify the deletion count, here is the clarification:\n\nWhen breaking down the scenario into steps:\n\n1. **Initial Count**: Dave had 23 apps.\n2. **Deletion**: He removed 18 apps.\n3. **Remaining Count**: After deletion, he was left with 5 apps.\n\nThis confirms the correct process and validates the original solution aligning well with the instructions you've outlined in your hints and responses.
