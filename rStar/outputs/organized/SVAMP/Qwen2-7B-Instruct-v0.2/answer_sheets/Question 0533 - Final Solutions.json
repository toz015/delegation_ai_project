Let X represent the amount of bottle caps Danny initially collected. First, we determine what happened to the bottle caps:\n\nHe threw away 60, so those are subtracted from his initial amount: \\(X - 60\\).\n\nThen, he found 58 new ones, which adds to his count: \\((X - 60) + 58\\).\n\nFinally, we know this equals 67, his current total: \n\\[ (X - 60) + 58 = 67.\\]\n\nFirst, solve for \\(X\\) by adding 60 to both sides of the equation to isolate \\(X\\) terms on one side:\n\\[ X - 60 + 60 + 58 = 67 + 60,\\]\n\\[ X + 58 = 127.\\]\n\nSubtracting 58 from both sides allows us to find \\(X\\):\n\\[ X = 127 - 58,\\]\n\\[ X = 69.\\]\n\nSo initially, Danny collected 69 bottle caps before throwing away any or finding more.
