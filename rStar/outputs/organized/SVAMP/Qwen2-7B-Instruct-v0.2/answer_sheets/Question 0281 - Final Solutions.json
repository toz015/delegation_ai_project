Given that there are 111 students and assuming every student needs a seat, we should calculate how many buses are needed rather than dividing the students into the number of buses as was initially suggested. \n\nTo determine the number of buses required:\n\n- First, identify the capacity of one bus, which is 3 seats.\n  \nSince we're trying to figure out how many full buses we can fill with 111 students (understanding the premise might not align perfectly with real-world logistics but adhering to the provided instruction), we divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus:\n\n- Number of buses needed = Total students / Seats per bus\n  \nPlugging in our numbers: \n  \nNumber of buses needed = 111 students / 3 seats/bus = 37 buses.\n\nHowever, interpreting the question literally suggests looking for the number of students per bus rather than determining the number of buses directly from the context provided.
