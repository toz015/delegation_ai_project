The farmer had 90 tomatoes initially. Yesterday, he picked 154 of them. Today, he picked 50. This means before picking today's amount, the farmer had 90 + 154 = 244 tomatoes (since these include both what was originally there plus what was picked yesterday). To find out how many tomatoes the farmer picked today based on this calculation, you subtract the original count from the sum of the initial count and yesterday's picks: \n\n244 (total after yesterday) - 90 (original count) = 154 (yesterday's picks).\n\nHowever, since we're asked specifically about how many were picked today:\n\nSince it's stated that today he picked 50 tomatoes, this aligns directly with the information provided without needing further calculation beyond confirmation.\n\nThe answer is: 50.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many tomatoes did he pick in all?", "subanswer": {"text": "In total, the farmer picked 154 from yesterday and an additional 50 today, making a grand total of 154 + 50 = 204 tomatoes picked in all.
