This means:\n\nTotal points = Points per game \u00d7 Number of games\n             = 109 \u00d7 79 \n\nCalculating this directly:\n\nTotal points = 109 \u00d7 79 \n             = 8551 \n\nSo if you followed through with the calculation process suggested by the hint but overlooked its application to the final outcome, you might mistakenly conclude \"the answer is 109.\" However, based on proper computation, Melissa's total score across 79 games, considering no other factors like bonus points beyond what's implied here, would indeed be calculated by multiplying these numbers together.
