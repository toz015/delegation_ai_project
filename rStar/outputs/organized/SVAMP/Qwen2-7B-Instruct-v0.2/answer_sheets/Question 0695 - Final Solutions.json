Dave initially had 11 apps and 3 files. So together, this was a total of 11 + 3 = 14 items. At the end, Dave had 2 apps and 24 files which totals up to 2 + 24 = 26 items. To find out how many items (files) Dave deleted, we subtract the final count from the initial count: 14 - 26 = -12. This means Dave didn't delete any files; instead, it appears there might be an error or misinterpretation since the final numbers exceed the initial count. Given the usual process of deletion resulting in fewer items, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in inputting the scenario details. \n\nIn a correct interpretation based on standard operations:\n\n- Initial number of items = 14\n- Final number of items = 26\n\nIt would imply Dave added 26 - 14 = 12 files rather than deleting them, which contradicts the question's context of 'deleting' files.\n\nGiven the original scenario and following typical problem solving, the answer regarding the deletion of files doesn't align properly under conventional understanding.
