We know he started with 3 and then added 4. To get back to his current total, let's first calculate the net addition: \\(3 (initial) + 4 (added) = 7\\). However, since the question asks about the final count when he has 6 action figures, it suggests no additional action figures were added beyond those mentioned, implying all actions led to reaching exactly 6 figures without exceeding it. This means the subtraction part (removals) would involve reducing the previous total plus additions down to 6. Since he started with 3 and added 4, making a total of 7 before any removals took place, and now he has 6, this indicates Jerry removed \\(7 (total before removal) - 6 (current total) = 1\\) action figure from the shelf.
