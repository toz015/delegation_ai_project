However, strictly from the arithmetic perspective, considering whole numbers, each group could ideally receive 7, since distributing equally involves whole units, and we're aiming for an equal division without fractional Skittles. The answer is based on whole unit distribution, implying ideal mathematical equality might allow for slight adjustments in actual distribution scenarios but adhering to the strict calculation yields an approximate average per group, hinting towards a common practice where rounding rules dictate handling fractions according to specific instructions or constraints not explicitly mentioned here. In essence, focusing on whole numbers, each group would optimally receive 7 Skittles, acknowledging real-world considerations may require adjustments. The precise interpretation depends on whether fractional Skittles are theoretically allowable in this scenario. Assuming they are not, the direct arithmetic suggests 7 skittles per group, aligning closely with practical expectations. The answer is based on whole numbers, leading to the conclusion each group receiving 7 Skittles under ideal conditions, subject to clarification on any theoretical allowance for fractional items in such distributions. Considering standard practices within contexts like organizing collections or allocating resources, the answer reflects a practical approach to ensuring equitable distribution without introducing partial items.
