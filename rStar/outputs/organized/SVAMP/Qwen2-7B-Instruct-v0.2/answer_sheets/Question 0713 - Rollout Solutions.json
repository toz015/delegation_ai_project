But without further details or another piece of data like 'he has X blocks left', we can't determine an exact number. \n\nHowever, let me show you how to set up the calculation based on your scenario:\n\nIf Randy initially had 97 blocks and used some to build a tower, the formula would look something like:\n\nBlocks Used = Initial Blocks - Remaining Blocks\n\nFor example,\n\nIf he ended up with 72 blocks remaining,\nBlocks Used = 97 - 72\nBlocks Used = 25\n\nSo if you provide the number of blocks Randy has left, I can calculate exactly how many he used.
