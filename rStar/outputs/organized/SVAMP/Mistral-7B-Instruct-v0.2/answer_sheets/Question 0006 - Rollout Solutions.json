Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nInitial number > 3.\n\nSince we know that Jerry had 7 new action figures, and he now has a total of 10 action figures, we can figure out that he initially had 10 - 7 = 3 action figures fewer than the current amount. So the initial number is 3 plus some additional action figures. Let's say X represents the additional number.
