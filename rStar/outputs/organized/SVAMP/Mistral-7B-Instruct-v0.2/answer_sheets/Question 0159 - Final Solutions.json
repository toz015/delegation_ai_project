This gives approximately 0.67 students per student. To determine how many students one bus can carry, we need to know how many students fit into one seat. Let's assume each student needs exactly one seat, so one bus can carry 58 students (the total number of students). Therefore, the number of buses required would be the number of students divided by the number of students per bus. 58 / 58 = 1 bus. However, due to condition 4, which states that two seats are available per bus, the actual number of students each bus can carry is 1 bus * 2 seats/student = 2 students/bus. Thus, the number of buses required to transport all the students is 58 / 2 = 29 buses.
