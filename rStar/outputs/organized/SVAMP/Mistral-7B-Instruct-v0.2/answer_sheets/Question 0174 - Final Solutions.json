We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our calculations: if Steven has 5 peaches and Jake has 3 fewer, then Jake has 5 - 3 = 2. Since both Steven and Jake have positive numbers of peaches, we must conclude that Steven actually has 5 +3=8 more peaches than Jill. This makes Jill have 5-8=-3 fewer peaches than Steven, which is indeed a mistake. To fix this, we should subtract 3 from the number of peaches that Jake has instead of adding 3 to the number of peaches that Steven has.
