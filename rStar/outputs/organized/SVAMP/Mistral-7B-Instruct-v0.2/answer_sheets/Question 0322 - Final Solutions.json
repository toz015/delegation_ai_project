According to condition 1, there are 3 birds and 4 storks initially. From condition 2, we learn that 6 more storks joined them. Therefore, the total number of birds and storks on the fence now is 3 (birds) + 4 (storks) + 6 (additional storks). 3+4+6 equals 13.

Initially, we know there are 3 birds and 4 storks. That means there are 3 birds + 4 storks = 7 non-bird animals. When 6 more storks arrive, the total number of animals increases to 7 (birds) + 10 (storks) = 17. However, the initial condition specified only birds as \"3 birds\" without explicitly stating there were no other animals present. Therefore, the presence of the 6 additional storks would actually replace some of the birds. Subtracting the 6 birds replaced by the new storks from the total number of animals leaves us with the original number of birds: 17 - 6 = 11. But this contradicts the initial condition specifying \"3 birds.\" Instead, it seems likely that the initial list of animals included both birds and storks, but the initial condition was mistakenly stated to apply only to birds.
