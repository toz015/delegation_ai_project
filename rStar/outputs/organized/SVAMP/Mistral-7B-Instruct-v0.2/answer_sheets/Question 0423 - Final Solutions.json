Hint 1 suggests that the number of students suggesting adding bacon is the total number of students responding, minus the difference between the number of students suggesting bacon and the number suggesting mashed potatoes. Since we know there were 63 fewer students suggesting mashed potatoes, we can write the equation numberOfBaconStudents = numberOfMashedPotatoStudents + 63. Rearranging terms gives us numberOfMashedPotatoStudents = numberOfBaconStudents - 63. Substituting the known value, numberOfMashedPotatoStudents = 457 - 63 = 394.

Substituting the expression for numberOfMashedPotatoStudents into the equation from part (a), we get: numberOfBaconStudents = numberOfBaconStudents + 63 - 63. Solving this equation reveals that the number of students who proposed adding bacon to the menu is zero. However, since we know that some students made suggestions, the correct answer is: the number of students who suggested adding bacon = 457 - numberOfMashedPotatoStudents. Using the equation from part (a) once again, we have numberOfMashedPotatoStudents = 457 - numberOfBaconStudents. Rearranging terms gives us numberOfBaconStudents = 457 - numberOfMashedPotatoStudents, or numberOfBaconStudents = 457 - (457 - numberOfBaconStudents). Simplifying, we find that numberOfBaconStudents = numberOfMashedPotatoes, which contradicts our earlier result of no students proposing adding bacon. This indicates that there is likely an error in one or both of the conditions provided.
