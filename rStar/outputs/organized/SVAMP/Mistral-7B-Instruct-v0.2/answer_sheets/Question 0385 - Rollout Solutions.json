Since she has none right now, she needs to add 5 cups of sugar. Therefore, she needs to add 3 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. In terms of the question asked, though, it was asking how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needed, not how much sugar and flour she needs in total. So the answer, according to the instructions, would just be 5 - 3 = 2. But this isn't really a valid answer since we don't actually know what amount of cups she had initially. It may seem like 2 might represent the difference in cups, but without knowing if she started with any sugar or flour, it's hard to tell. So while this calculation is technically correct based on the information provided (she needs 2 more cups of sugar compared to cups of flour), it may not actually be accurate because of the way the question was phrased.
