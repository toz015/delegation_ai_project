We know that the total number of items in all the bags is 26 and the total number of items including both candies and cookies is 67. Since the total number of cookies is equal to the total number of identical bags, we can determine the number of cookies in one bag as follows:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of candies in one bag. Since there are 67 items in total (condition 2) and 26 bags exist (condition 1), we can find the number of cookies in one bag as the number of bags itself, which is 26. By subtracting this value from the total number of items (67), we can determine the number of candies in one bag.\n\nTotal items = Items in one bag * Number of bags\n67 = (Items in one bag) * 26\n\nTo find Items in one bag, divide both sides by 26:\n\nItems in one bag = 67 / 26\nItems in one bag = 2.58\n\nSince it is not possible for a bag to", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
