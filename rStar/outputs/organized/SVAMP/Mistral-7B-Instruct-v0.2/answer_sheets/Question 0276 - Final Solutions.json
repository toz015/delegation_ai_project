Instead, we need to find the smallest multiple of our starting condition (quantity created) that can result in the correct final quantity. By checking multiples of 10 (the smallest reasonable quantity), we find that if he starts with 110 cakes, after selling 145 he would indeed have 72 remaining. The answer is: 145 - 110 = 35.
