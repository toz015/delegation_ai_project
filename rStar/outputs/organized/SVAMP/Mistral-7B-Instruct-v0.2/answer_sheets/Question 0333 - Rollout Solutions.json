All we can determine is that there were originally 2 roses and Jessica threw away 4, making a net loss of 2 roses. But the current number of roses, 23, suggests that she also added some new roses. Without knowing the exact number of new roses, we cannot directly calculate the difference between the current number of roses and the original number to find out how many roses Jessica cut. Instead, we can set up an equation to represent the information given: 2 (original) + X (newly cut) = 23 (current). Solving for X requires one more piece of information, which isn't provided.
