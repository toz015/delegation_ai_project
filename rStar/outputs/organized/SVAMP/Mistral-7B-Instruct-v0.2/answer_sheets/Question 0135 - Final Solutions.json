So now he has 77 potatoes remaining (because he picked 172 and subtracting that from the initial 77 leaves us with 77). The amount of tomatoes remains the same as initially since no information was provided about him picking or losing any tomatoes. Therefore, the farmer has 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes left in his garden.

Based on the information provided, we don't know how many tomatoes the farmer picked. However, since we know he had 175 tomatoes initially, we can calculate how many potatoes remain by subtracting what he picked from his original quantity. Given that he picked 172 potatoes, this leaves him with 77 - 172 = -95 potatoes. Since it's not possible to have negative numbers of potatoes, there must be missing information.\n\nThe problem statement should include either the number of potatoes the farmer didn't pick or the number of tomatoes he picked. Without this information, it's impossible to determine the current quantities of both vegetables. The answer is: We cannot determine the quantities of tomatoes and potatoes based on the available information.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
