Let x be the initial number of roses. x > 19 (because she didn't remove any). Since she added enough roses to make a new total of 19, we can write this equation: x = 19 + n * 3 (where n is the number of batches of 3 roses she added). Solving for x, we find that x = 19 + 3n. Since x is an integer, n must be an integer as well. Let's test n=1: if x = 19 + 3*1, then x = 22, which doesn't work since we said x is greater than 19. So let's try n=2: if x = 19 + 3*2, then x = 25, which also doesn't work. Continuing in this way, we find that when n=6, x=19+3*6 = 27.
