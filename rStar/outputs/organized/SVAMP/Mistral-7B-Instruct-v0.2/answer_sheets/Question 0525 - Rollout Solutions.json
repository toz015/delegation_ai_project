Each guest received 19 cookies. To feed this number of cookies to one guest, it takes 19 cookies. So to feed all the guests, it would take as many sets of 19 cookies as there are guests. The number of guests is equal to the number of sets of 19 cookies which can be made from the 38 cookies. Let's calculate the number of sets: 38 / 19 = approximately 2 (with remainder 1). Since you cannot have a fraction of a guest, we need to add another set, so the actual number of guests is 2 + 1= 3.
