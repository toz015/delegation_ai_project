Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill. And Steven has 19 peaches. Using this information we can write the equation: Steven = Jake+18, Jake=Jill+13, Steven=Jill+13+18=31. Since Steven has 19 peaches, this means Steven has 19-2=17 fewer peaches than he should based on our equations. Thus, Jill has 19+17=36 peaches. But since the problem states that 'Steven has 19 peaches', it seems that there's a mistake in the problem statement. Based on the provided information, Jake and Jill should both have 36-13=23 peaches.
