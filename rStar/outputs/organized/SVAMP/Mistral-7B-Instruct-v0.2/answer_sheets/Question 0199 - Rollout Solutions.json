First, we calculate how long the water bottles can last Debby. She buys 162 water bottles and consumes 122 per day, so this means she goes through (162 - 122 =) 40 water bottles every day. To find out how many days the water bottles can last, we divide the total amount of water bottles she has by the amount she uses per day: 162 / 40 = 4.1 days. Since she cannot have a fraction of a day, it lasts for 4 full days.\n\nNext, let's calculate how long the soda bottles can last her based on her daily consumption: she consumes 9 soda bottles per day, so they last 360 / 9 = 40 days.
