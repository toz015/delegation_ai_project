This suggests that we need to find out what fraction of the total seating capacity each large seat represents. \n\nWe know that one rotation holds 132 passengers, and 7 of those seats are large seats. Let x be the number of people that can fit on one large seat.

Instead, one large seat has a capacity of 132/7 \u2248 18.86 passengers. Rounding down the number of passengers for one large seat to the nearest whole number, the answer is approximately 19.
