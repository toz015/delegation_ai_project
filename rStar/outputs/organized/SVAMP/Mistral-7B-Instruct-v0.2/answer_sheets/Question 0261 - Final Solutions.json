Let's assume they sold exactly 10 t-shirts for $23 each. Their actual revenue would be 10 x 23 = 230. But as stated, their total profits were $230. We need to consider that they probably rounded either the profit or the quantity sold. One possibility is that they actually sold 11 t-shirts (which would result in a revenue of 23 x 11 = $253). In reality, they might have recorded 10 t-shirts sold and adjusted their stated profit per unit accordingly to match their reported total profits. As such, it's hard to pinpoint the exact number of t-shirts they sold without further information.

Each t-shirt sale results in a profit of 230 dollars. Hence, they sold 230 / 230 = 1 t-shirt. But this isn't the correct answer since we know they didn't sell just one shirt. Let's try again. To find the actual number of shirts sold, divide the total profit by the profit made per shirt: 230 dollars \u00f7 23 dollars/shirt = 10 shirts. However, we missed an important detail in our calculation. We assumed that the profit mentioned was pure profit without any cost involved. Since there might be costs like taxes or production fees associated with each sale, let's revise our previous calculation. Let x be the number of shirts sold. Then, the profit equation becomes Profit = Revenue - Costs. Here, Revenue = 23x (dollars) and Costs = some constant value C for each shirt. Solving the equation, we get Profit = 23(x-C), where x represents the actual number of shirts sold. Since the profit was reported as 230 dollars, setting up an equation, we have 230 = 23(x-C). Dividing both sides by 23, we get x-C = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10+C. Since C is a constant representing the cost per shirt, we cannot determine its exact value with the provided information. Thus, we cannot give a definitive answer. Nonetheless, we now have an expression for x, which is x = 10+C, indicating that the number of shirts sold is equal to 10 plus the cost per shirt.", "value": 0.875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold.
