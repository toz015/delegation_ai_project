Apples, as mentioned in condition 1, Jake has more of them. We also know that Jake has 8 more apples (condition 3). To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, first let's figure out how many peaches Jake has. Since he has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 17, Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches. However, according to condition 1, Jake has more apples than peaches, and according to condition 3, he has 8 more apples than Steven. Therefore, Steven has 16 apples (from condition 3), and since Jake has 11 peaches and less apples, it means Steven has more peaches than apples.

According to condition 1, Jake has fewer peaches than Steven but more apples. We know that Jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples (according to conditions 2 and 3 respectively). Since Jake has fewer peaches than Steven, we can assume that Steven has more peaches than Jake. We already know that Steven has 17 peaches. Let's find out how many apples Steven has. According to condition 3, Jake has 8 more apples than Steven, so Steven has 16 apples (as per condition 3) and Jake has 24 apples (16 + 8). To determine the difference in the number of peaches and apples that Steven possesses, let's subtract the number of apples he has from the number of peaches he has. So, the difference is 17 (peaches) - 16 (apples) = 1.
