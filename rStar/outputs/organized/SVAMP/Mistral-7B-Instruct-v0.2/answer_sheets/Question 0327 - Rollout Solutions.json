However, this does not make sense since it implies that Luke earned less than 3 points in his last round. Instead, we might have made a mistake in our calculation. It could be that Luke earned 3 points per round in the earlier rounds and then earned 78 - (number of early rounds * 3) points in the later rounds. We can try different numbers for the number of early rounds until we reach a valid result. Let's try 24 early rounds and see if that works: 24 * 3 = 72. 78 - 72 = 6.
