One row holds 22 pencils. She has 6 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 14 pencils. To find the total number of pencils, we first calculate the number of pencils in all the packs: Number of packs * Pencils per pack = Total number of pencils in packs => 6 * 14 = 84. Since one row fits 22 pencils, divide the total number of pencils by 22 to see how many rows can hold them: Total number of pencils / Pencils per row = Total number of rows => 84 / 22 = 3.81. But since Faye cannot organize her pencils into a fraction of a row, round up to 4 rows and add the remaining pencils to the last row: Rows * Pencils per row + Remaining pencils = Total number of pencils => 4 * 22 + 8 = 92.
