We know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Since Ed lost 17, before he lost them he had 29 + 17 = 46 marbles. But we know Doug had X marbles. So 46 - X = 29. Solving this equation for X, we find that X = 17. So initially, Doug had 17 fewer marbles than Ed, or equivalently, Ed had 29 + 17 = 46 - 17 = 29 more marbles than Doug.

Initially, Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Let's call the number of marbles Doug had D. So Ed had D+29 marbles. After Ed lost 17 marbles, he had D+29-17=D+12 marbles. Since Ed initially had 29 more marbles, it means Doug had D=D+29-29=D marbles. Also, since Ed had D+12 marbles after losing 17, we can write the equation: D + 12 = D + 29 - 17 => 12 = 12. This equation holds only if both sides are equal to zero. But this result doesn't make sense here, so let's try again. Since Ed initially had 29 more marbles, we know that: D = Ed's marbles - 29 = (D+29) - 29 = D. This equality holds only when Ed's initial marbles count was D = 29. Therefore, Ed lost 29-17=12 marbles.

But this result makes no sense, because there should be some initial difference between their marbles counts. Let's assume a small mistake was made in the problem statement and instead of \"Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug,\" it should read \"Ed had 29 fewer marbles than Doug.\" In this case, our previous reasoning still applies, but the signs for the differences in the number of marbles should be reversed. Thus, Doug had D = 29 marbles initially, and Ed had D = 29-29=0 marbles. But again, this result doesn't hold. To find the correct answer, let's calculate it from first principles: Ed initially had D marbles; Doug had D+29 marbles; the difference between their amounts of marbles was 29. Subtracting Doug's marbles count from Ed's, we get Ed's marbles = D, Doug's marbles = D+29. The difference between their marbles counts is 29, so D - (D+29) = 29 => D = -29, which contradicts reality. Therefore, the assumption about the incorrect sign of the difference between their marbles counts is invalid. Consequently, Ed initially had 29 fewer marbles than Doug.
