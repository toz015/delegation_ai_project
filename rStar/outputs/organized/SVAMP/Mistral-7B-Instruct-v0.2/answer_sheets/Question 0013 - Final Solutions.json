The water depth is 15 times Dean's height, or 15(h+4). Substituting the value of Dean's height back in, we get 15(h+4) = 15(h+4+4) = 15(h+8). Dividing both sides by 15, we have h+8 = d/15. We don't know d, but it doesn't matter since the question asks for the depth of the water. Thus, the water is h+8 units deep (we don't care about units, so let's call it just 'depth'). Now, we can find h using the fact that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. So h = Ron's height - Dean's excess height = 13 - 4 = 9 feet. Substituting h = 9 into h+8 = d/15, we get 9+8 = d/15. Solving for d, we have 17 = d/15. Multiplying both sides by 15, we obtain d = 15*17 = 255. So the depth of the water is 255 units, or approximately 255 feet. However, considering the context of the problem, it seems unlikely that the depth of the water would be measured in feet rather than in meters. So it might be more reasonable to assume that the water depth was described in meters instead, making the depth 255 * 3.28 = 823 meters. In summary, the depth of the water is either 255 feet (approximately) or 823 meters depending on the measurement unit used in the problem statement.
