First, let's find out how many baseball cards were transferred to Jeff: We know that the number of baseball cards Nell holds later is 404. Subtracting the initial number (246) reveals the number of baseball cards transferred: 404 \u2013 246 = 158. Next, let's determine how many Ace cards Jeff received in exchange: Since Nell kept 214 Ace cards initially and ended up with 495 Ace cards, the increase is 495 \u2013 214 = 281. However, since 158 baseball cards were transferred, we need to subtract the equal number of Ace cards that Jeff must have received in return: 281 \u2013 158 = 123. Therefore, the difference in the number of Ace cards and baseball cards is 495 \u2013 404 = 91.
