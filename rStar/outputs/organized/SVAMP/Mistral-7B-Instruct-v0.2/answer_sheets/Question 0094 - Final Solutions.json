To find out how many hours each kid spends on one day, we divide the total hours by the number of kids for that day. So on Monday, hours per kid = 38 / 19 = approximately 2 hours. And on Tuesday, hours per kid = 38 / 18 = approximately 2.11 hours (but since kids can't have fractions of hours, we round it down to 2 hours). Since each kid interacts with all other kids once during tag, the number of interactions each kid makes is equal to the total number of kids minus one. So on Monday, Julia made (19 - 1) = 18 interactions. And on Tuesday, she made (18 - 1) = 17 interactions. Therefore, she made 18 - 17 = 1 more interaction on Monday than on Tuesday.

Since kids spend slightly less than an hour playing tag on Monday (19 x 1 hour = 19 hours), and slightly less than an hour on Tuesday (18 x 1 hour = 18 hours), it means that one additional child joined them on Monday (19 hours / 1.027 hours/kid \u2248 18.6 children, so almost 19 children).
