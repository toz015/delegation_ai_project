Jerry initially had 8 action figures. He added 4 more. So he ended up having 8 + 4 = 12 action figures. Since he removed 5 old ones, he still has 12 - 5 = 7 new action figures. The answer is: 4 (4 new action figures were added).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Hint 1 confirms that 4 new action figures were added. As for the total number of action figures on Jerry's shelf throughout this period, we know that initially, he had 8 action figures. After adding and removing some, he ended up with 7 new ones. Therefore, the total number of action figures was 8 (original) + 4 (added) = 12. However, he only has 7 new ones. That means there must have been 12 - 7 = 5 old action figures on the shelf before removing them. Thus, the total number of action figures on Jerry's shelf throughout this period was 12. The answer is: 12.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
