We know that there are 10 red peaches in a basket and each basket has 11 total peaches. So there are 11 - 10 = 1 extra peach, which is a green peach.

But this question asked for the number of green peaches in just one basket, so it should be 144 / 11 = 13. But it seems like I made a mistake, since 13 is not divisible by 18.

However, in my previous hint I mentioned a wrong calculation for the number of green peaches in one basket, which resulted in the incorrect calculation of the total number of peaches. The correct number of green peaches in one basket is indeed 18.
