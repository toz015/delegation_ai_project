To find the total number of emails Jack received, we add the emails from the morning, afternoon, and evening: 6 (morning) + 3 (afternoon) + 5 (evening) = 14. But we missed counting one email somewhere! Let's re-evaluate. We see that condition 3 says \"5 emails arrive\", but it doesn't specify if those are new emails or just emails that Jack received in the evening. If those were already counted in the morning or afternoon, then Jack actually only received 9 emails in total.\n\nThe correct answer is: 9 (if all emails were unique).
