On Monday, Tiffany collected enough cans for 4 bags. Let's assume she collected x cans per bag. Then she had 4x cans. The next day she collected some more bags worth of cans, so she collected 4x + x additional cans. If she ended up with y bags of cans, then we know that y-1 bags contain 4x cans and 1 bag contains (x+4x) cans, which is 5x cans. We can set up an equation: 4x + 5x = y*5, or 9x = y. Since it's not possible for y to be a fractional value, there must be some multiple m of x such that my equals mx. Thus, y=mx. Substituting back into the first equation, we find that mx = 4x + 5x => 9x = 9x + 5x => 4x = 5x.
