Hint 1 says that each bag holds 11 pieces of candy. The problem states that Frank has exactly 22 pieces of candy. To find out how many bags he needs, we need to know how many candies one bag can hold and divide the total number of candies by that. Therefore, X is equal to the quotient of the number of candies Frank has (which is 22) divided by the number of candies in one bag (which is 11). We write this as X = 22/11 = 2. So, Frank needs to buy 3 bags to have enough candy for all the bags. However, since he only has 22 candies, the last bag won't be filled completely.
