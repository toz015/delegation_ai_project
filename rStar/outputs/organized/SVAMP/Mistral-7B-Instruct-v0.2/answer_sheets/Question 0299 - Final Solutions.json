In fact, there is no mistake in the question itself as stated. But since the length of the grasshopper's jump is already given, it is not necessary to calculate it again when trying to determine the length of the mouse's jump. The correct solution would involve using the information about the frog's jump being 18 inches longer than the grasshopper's, and the mouse's jump being 2 inches longer than the frog's, and then calculating the mouse's jump directly based on these facts without having to recalculate the grasshopper's jump. This would yield the result that the mouse jumped 45 inches (since the frog jumped 43 inches and the mouse jumped 2 inches more).
