Here, the Initial number of crackers is 15 and the Remaining number of crackers is 10. So the number of crackers each friend ate is (15 - 10) / 5 = 3. This means that each friend ate 3 crackers, so the total number of crackers eaten is 3 * 5 = 15.

Initially, Matthew had 15 crackers. After giving crackers to his 5 friends, he was left with 10 crackers. First, let's find out how many crackers each friend got. Since there's a remainder of 10 crackers when dividing by 5, it means that each friend got 5 less than the quotient. Quotient = Total_crackers / Number_of_friends. Quotient = 15 / 5 = 3. So each friend gets 3 - 5 = -2 crackers less than what Matthew initially had. But this doesn't make sense, since you can't give away negative crackers.
