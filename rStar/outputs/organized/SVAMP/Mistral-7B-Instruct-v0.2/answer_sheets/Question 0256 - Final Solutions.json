However, we also know that she bought a total of 12 packs of cakes and the total change was 56 units. Let's first find out the cost of one cake pack. Since the total value of her change is 56 units, and she had 12 packs of cakes, the cost of one cake pack is 56 / 12 = 4.67. However, since the number of packs must be a whole number, this implies that the cost of one cake pack is actually 5 units (rounding up). With this information, we can now calculate the number of packs of groceries (including both cookies and cakes) that Lucy bought.
