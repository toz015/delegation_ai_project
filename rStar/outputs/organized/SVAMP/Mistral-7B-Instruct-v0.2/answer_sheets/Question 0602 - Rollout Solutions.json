We know that during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 113 t-shirts and made 113 x $25 = $2825 in profit from those sales. Also, they sold 78 jerseys and made 78 x $115 = $8865 in profit from those sales. The total profit earned was $8865 + $2825 = $11690. But we only know the number of items sold, not their costs. To find the difference in cost between one jersey and one t-shirt, we can use this equation: Profit from one jersey sale = Cost of one jersey - Cost of one t-shirt. Setting up the equation: $115 = Cost of one jersey - Cost of one t-shirt. This equation doesn't have enough information to directly determine the answer. However, we can make some logical deductions: Since both the Razorback shop and you are buying these items to resell them, the cost of a jersey must be greater than the cost of a t-shirt (because the jersey sale price was greater", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The Razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt.

The total revenue was $8835 + $2825 = $11660. Since the difference in price between a jersey and a t-shirt is $90 ($115-$25), we can calculate how many jerseys they sold by dividing their revenue from jerseys by $90: 8835/90. Rounded up, this is 98. But since they only sold 78 jerseys, we must have made an error in our calculation. Let's double check it.
