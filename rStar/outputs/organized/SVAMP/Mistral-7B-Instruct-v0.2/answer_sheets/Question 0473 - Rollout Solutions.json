However, this answer seems incorrect. Let me check my calculations again. I see that I made an error in my first calculation. The correct calculation should be the difference between the initial number of books and the number of books that Paul has left, not the other way around. So, the correct calculation would be 153 (initial number of books) minus 13 (books left), which equals 140. Therefore, Paul sold 140 - 153 = -13 books.
