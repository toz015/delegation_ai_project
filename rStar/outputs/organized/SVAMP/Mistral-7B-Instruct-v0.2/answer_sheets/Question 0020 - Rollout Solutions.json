Then he sold 105 cakes. His sales earned him enough money to buy another 170 cakes. Let's find out how much he earned from selling 105 cakes. This involves setting up an equation for cake cost price parity. Let's say the price per cake that the baker sells it for is X dollars. We know he made 121 cakes, sold 105, so 121 - 105 = 16 cakes remained unsold, costing him X dollars. Since we also know that this money was used to buy 170 new cakes, this means that X dollars is equal to 170 dollars. By solving for X, we get X = 170 / 16 = 106.25 dollars.
