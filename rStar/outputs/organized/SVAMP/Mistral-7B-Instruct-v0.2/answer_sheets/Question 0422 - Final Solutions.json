From condition 2, there are 4950 erasers. This matches the hint's answer. Therefore, each group consists of the same number of erasers as there are in total. Since there are 495 such groups (condition 4), we can divide the total number of erasers by the number of groups to find out how many erasers are in one group. 4950 erasers divided by 495 groups equals 10.
