To find the exact number, we can round down the result to see if we can still distribute all the marbles equally: 6 marbles for each boy results in 18 marbles used up. We need 2 marbles more. So we can try giving 5 marbles to each boy instead: 15 marbles used up, we still need 5 marbles. It seems impossible to distribute the remaining 5 marbles equally between the boys. Maybe Haley can keep some marbles for herself or give one or more marbles to each boy until she manages to distribute all the marbles. In this scenario, each boy receives 5 marbles, but Haley keeps the rest, resulting in a total of 15+x=20 marbles, where x represents the number of extra marbles Haley keeps.
