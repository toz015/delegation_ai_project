Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. Since he wanted to give equal numbers of both to his friends, we need to find the common number.

We can check this with trial and error, 29/x = 30/x, so x=1 (divisible by 1), x=2 (doesn't work because 30/2 != 29), x=3... Finally, when x=5, it works (29/5 = 5.8, 30/5 = 6).

First, we need to find out how many items Matthew has in total. He has 29 crackers and 30 cakes, which sum up to 29 + 30 = 59 items. Since he wants to divide all his items equally between 2 people, each person gets half of this total: 59 / 2 = 29.5, but since it cannot divide evenly, we will round down to 29 items per person. However, since each person also receives the same number of crackers as cakes (which is not mentioned), they would actually receive an equal number of both crackers and cakes.

Matthew owns 29 crackers and 30 cakes. Since both friends will receive the same amount of each item, we need to find the common divisor of 29 and 30, which is 1.

But since Matthew only has 29 crackers, this isn't possible. Instead, the friends will each receive 14 crackers and 15 cakes (a total of 29 crackers). To check if this is enough for both friends, we calculate the remaining crackers: 29 crackers - (14 crackers/friend) * 2 = 1 cracker. Since there's no leftover cracker, this configuration is valid.
