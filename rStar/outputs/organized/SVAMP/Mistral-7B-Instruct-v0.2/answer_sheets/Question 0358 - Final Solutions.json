After migration to both Africa and Asia, there were 94 bird families (Condition 3). Since there were 47 bird families that flew away to Africa (Condition 2), then there must have been 94 - 47 = 47 bird families that flew away to Asia. The difference is 47 (the number of bird families that flew away to Asia) minus the number we already know is 47, so the difference is 0. However, since the question asks for the difference, not whether it's zero or not, the answer needs to be 47 to represent the difference in number of bird families between Africa and Asia.
