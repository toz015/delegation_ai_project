The answer is 91.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many Nintendo games did Kelly start off with?", "subanswer": {"text": "Kelly started off with the number of games she had before giving any away. She now has 92 games and gave away 91. So she started off with 91 + 92 = 183 Nintendo games. But this is incorrect because the initial condition says only 91 games were given away. This indicates that one game was mistakenly included in the list of games given away or the initial condition was incorrect. We don't know Kelly's starting number, but we do know she gave away 91 games and has 92 games now. Thus, the original question cannot be answered definitively from the given information.", "value": 0.3125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
