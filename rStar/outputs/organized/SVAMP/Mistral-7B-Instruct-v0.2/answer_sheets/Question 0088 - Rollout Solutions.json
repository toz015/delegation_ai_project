We know that Paco initially had 12 cookies (Condition 1). After eating 16 cookies (Condition 2), he was left with a lesser amount. Let's calculate how many cookies he must have given away (Condition 3) such that his current quantity is less than 12. Since Paco initially had 12 and ate 16, he now has 12 - 16 = -4 cookies. However, it's not possible for someone to have a negative number of cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies Paco gave away must be greater than 16. Specifically, if Paco gave away 1 more cookie than he ate, then he would have given away 16 + 1 = 17 cookies. But since the instruction asks for the difference between the number of cookies Paco gave away and the number of cookies he ate, the actual answer is 17 - 16 = 1.
