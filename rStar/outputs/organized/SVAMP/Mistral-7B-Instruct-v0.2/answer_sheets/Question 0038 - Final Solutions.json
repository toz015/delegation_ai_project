Condition 1: 142 bananas exist in the collection. Condition 2: The number of banana groups is 47. Condition 3: 356 oranges exist in the collection. Condition 4: The number of orange groups is 178. Question: What size is each group of oranges?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many oranges are there in the collection?", "subanswer": {"text": "To find out how many oranges are in the collection, we first need to determine how many oranges are in each group. Since there are 178 orange groups, and the total number of oranges is given to be 356, we can calculate how many oranges are in one group by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of orange groups. So, the size of one orange group is 356 / 178 = 2 oranges. Now, to find out how many oranges are in the entire collection, we can multiply the size of one orange group by the total number of orange groups, i.e., 2 oranges/group * 178 groups = 356 oranges. Therefore, the answer is: 356 oranges.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What size is each group of bananas?", "subanswer": {"text": "Similarly, since there are 47 banana groups, and the total number of bananas is given to be 142, we can determine how many bananas are in one group by dividing the total number of bananas by the number of banana groups. Thus, the size of one banana group is 142 / 47 = 3 bananas.
