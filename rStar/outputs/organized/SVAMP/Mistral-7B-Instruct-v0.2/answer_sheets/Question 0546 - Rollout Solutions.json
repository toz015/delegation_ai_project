The recipe requires 6 cups of sugar and 9 cups of flour. Mary has already used 2 cups of flour. Since there was no mention of sugar yet, let's focus on the flour. Flour requirement was 9 cups, and 2 cups have already been used. 9 - 2 = 7. But the question asked about sugar. So we need to find out the amount of sugar required using this information. Sugar and flour both go into cakes, so their ratio could be roughly 2:3 or 1:1.5. Since the recipe states only 6 cups of sugar, it seems like the ratio here is 1:1.5 (1 cup of sugar for every 1.5 cups of flour). Using this ratio, for 7 cups of flour, the corresponding amount of sugar would be 7/1.5 = approximately 5 cups. However, the recipe might not be exact, and this is just a rough estimation. To get the exact value, one would need to consult the recipe itself.

That means she still needs 7 - 2 = 5 more cups of flour. Comparing the difference between the quantities of sugar and flour she still needs to add, we have 1 cup of sugar vs 5 cups of flour. The difference is 5 cups. So, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. The answer is 5.", "value": 0.1875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
