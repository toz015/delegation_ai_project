Solving this equation reveals that the number of students who proposed adding bacon to the menu is zero. However, since we know that some students made suggestions, the correct answer is: the number of students who suggested adding bacon = 457 - numberOfMashedPotatoStudents. Using the equation from part (a) once again, we have numberOfMashedPotatoStudents = 457 - numberOfBaconStudents. Rearranging terms gives us numberOfBaconStudents = 457 - numberOfMashedPotatoStudents, or numberOfBaconStudents = 457 - (457 - numberOfBaconStudents). Simplifying, we find that numberOfBaconStudents = numberOfMashedPotatoes, which contradicts our earlier result of no students proposing adding bacon.
