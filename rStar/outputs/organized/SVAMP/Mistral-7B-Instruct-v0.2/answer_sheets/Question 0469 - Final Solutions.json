According to the first hint, David did 54 push-ups. Using the second hint, John did 45 push-ups. Since Zachary did 15 fewer push-ups than John, Zachary did 45 - 15 = 30 push-ups. However, we made an error in our initial calculation when determining how many push-ups David did. We mistakenly said \"David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary\", but it should have been \"David did 39 fewer push-ups than John.\" Therefore, the correct difference between the number of push-ups Zachary and John did is 45 (John) - 30 (Zachary) = 15.
