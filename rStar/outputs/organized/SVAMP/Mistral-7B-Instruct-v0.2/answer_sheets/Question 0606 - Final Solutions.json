Instead, we need to figure out how many full days of English study there are. By dividing the total hours spent on English by the daily hours, and rounding down to the nearest whole number (as Ryan cannot spend a fraction of a day on English), we get 344 hours / 24 hours/day \u2248 14.33 days \u2248 15 days. Therefore, Ryan studies English for 15 days. As there are 24 hours in a day, the number of hours Ryan spends", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Ryan studies English for 15 days. Each day, he studies English for 4 hours, so he spends 15 days * 4 hours/day = 60 hours on English. Similarly, he studies Chinese for 6 hours per day, making it 86 days * 6 hours/day = 516 hours. Adding these hours together, Ryan spends a total of 60 hours (on English) + 516 hours (on Chinese) = 576 hours on learning both languages. Converting hours to days, we have 576 hours / 24 hours/day \u2248 24.42 days. However, since Ryan cannot study for a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number, resulting in 24 days. Thus, Ryan spends 24 full days studying both English and Chinese. To find out how many hours he spends on both subjects daily, we divide the total hours spent by the number of days: 576 hours / 24 days = 24 hours/day.
