The number of customers increased from 14 (Condition 2) to the current number due to Condition 3. The difference between these numbers is the number of new arrivals. That means there were 10 more customers at the end than when Condition 2 was met. Since Condition 1 states that there were originally 12 customers, the initial count must have been one more than this, i.e., 13. However, if we make that correction, there would be 1 more customer than stated in condition 2, which contradicts the problem statement.
