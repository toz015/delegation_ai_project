This doesn't make sense because it implies that there are less than zero green peaches. It seems like there was an error made when adding up the number of green peaches. Let me double check: I see, you meant to say \"66 fruits in total, of which 6 are green and 60 are yellow.\" In this case, we can find the number of red peaches by subtracting the number of green and yellow peaches from the total number of fruits: 66 - 6 - 60 = 0.
