We're asked about the difference between the number of push-ups Zachary did, and the number of crunches he did. Since the question states that David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than Zachary, we can set up the following equation: (35 push-ups for Zachary) + 58 = (number of push-ups for David), and (3 crunches for Zachary) - 87 = (number of crunches for David). Solving this system of equations will yield the answer. Let's calculate it: 35 + 58 = 93. Subtracting 87 from 3 leaves us with 3.
