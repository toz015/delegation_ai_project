Condition 1 tells us Marco and his father picked 36 pounds together. Marco lost 8 pounds during transportation. This means his original portion weighed 12 + 8 = 20 pounds. Since their total was 36, his father's portion was 12 + 20 = 22 pounds. 22 pounds is equal to 22 * 16 (oz to lb conversion factor) = 352 oz. Converting back, 352 oz is equal to 352 / 16 = 21.875 lb. However, since we cannot have fractions of pounds in this context, we can round up to the nearest whole pound, making it 36 pounds as stated in condition 1. Therefore, our assumption was correct.
