Here's an alternative solution: Rebecca has 15 eggs and wants to divide them among 3 groups. Each group can have as many eggs as Rebecca has marbles (which is 4), and whatever remains. That means the first group gets 4 eggs, the second group gets 4 eggs, and the third group gets the rest which is 15 - 4 - 4 = 7 eggs. Thus, the total number of eggs is 4*3+7=15.
