The cage contained 79 total animals. Let x represent the number of snakes and y represent the number of alligators. We know that x + y = 79. But we also know that snakes typically have fewer legs than alligators. Since snakes have zero legs, and alligators have 4 legs per animal on average, we can assume that y must be smaller than x. To find the possible values of x and y that satisfy this condition, we can test different combinations of x and y until we find one that results in a valid total number of animals. Starting with the smallest possible value of x (i.e., 1), we can try different values of y until we reach 79. We find that when x = 31 and y = 48, the equation holds true.
