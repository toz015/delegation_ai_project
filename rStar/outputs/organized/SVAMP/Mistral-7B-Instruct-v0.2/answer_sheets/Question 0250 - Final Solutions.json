Initially, there were 3 bird families (Condition 1). Then, there were 26 new arrivals (Condition 2). However, Condition 3 mentions that some birds left, so the current number is lower than the sum of the initial and the new arrivals. The difference between the sum of the initial number and the current number is the number of birds that left. Let's find the initial number: 3. The sum of the initial number and the new arrivals is: 3 + 26 = 29. To find the current number, we need to subtract the number of birds that left: 29 - x = 27, where x is the number of birds that left. Solving for x, we get x = 2.
