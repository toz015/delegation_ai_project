Since he ended up with 12 apps and 30 files, the rest of the 74 items he deleted were all files. Thus, he deleted 59 (initial items) - 42 (remaining files) = 17 files.

That means he deleted some apps and files but we don't know exactly how many of each type he deleted. However, he now only has 12 apps remaining, so he deleted 15 - 12 = 3 apps.
