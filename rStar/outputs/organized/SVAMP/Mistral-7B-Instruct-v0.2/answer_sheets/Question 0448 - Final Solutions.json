Since the pickers fill 100 drums of raspberries daily and we know that the desired total for grapes is given for 77 days, we can set up a proportion to determine the number of drums filled with grapes daily. Here's how:\n\nTotal drums filled daily = Drums of raspberries filled daily + Drums of grapes filled daily\nFrom condition 1, we know that:\n100 (drums of raspberries) + Drums of grapes filled daily = Total drums filled daily\n\nWe want to find the value of \"Drums of grapes filled daily\". Let's represent it as \"x\". Given that the pickers fill 100 drums of raspberries daily and need to fill grapes for 77 days, we can create a proportion:\n\n100 (drums of raspberries) / 1 = x (drums of grapes) / 77", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
