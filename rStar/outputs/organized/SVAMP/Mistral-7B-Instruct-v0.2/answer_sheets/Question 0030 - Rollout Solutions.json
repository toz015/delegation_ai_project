Tiffany had 7 bags of cans on Monday. The next day she collected enough cans to fill 12 more bags. So she collected a total of 7 + 12 = 19 bags of cans. Since we want to know how many bags she had on Monday, the difference between the number of bags she had then and the number she had afterwards is equal to the number of bags she collected during Tuesday. Therefore, 19 - 7 = 12. The answer is: 12 (bags of cans she collected on Tuesday). However, since we wanted to find out how many bags she had on Monday, this value is the opposite of what we calculated. Thus, 12 becomes -12. The answer is: -12 (number of bags she had fewer on Tuesday than on Monday). Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of bags, we must have made an error.
