Thus, the question doesn't provide enough information to find out how much money Fred earned specifically.\n\nTo give you a hint, if we make the assumption that they earned their extra money equally, we could calculate how long they both worked in total based on the combined increase in their earnings. Assuming there are 168 hours in a week, each gaining an additional 21 dollars means they each worked approximately 10.5 hours. But keep in mind, these are only estimates.
