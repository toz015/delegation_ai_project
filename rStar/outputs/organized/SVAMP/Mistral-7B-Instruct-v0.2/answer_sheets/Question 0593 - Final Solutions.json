To find the cost of one shirt we can set up the equation Profit = Cost - Selling_price. We know Selling_Price = $43 (since they sold 5 shirts for $215), so we can set up the equation Cost - $43 = $215. Solving this equation for Cost yields Cost = $258. However, since it doesn't make sense for the cost to be higher than the selling price, we need to reconsider our assumption. Since the shop made a profit, the selling price must be higher than the cost. Thus, we can conclude that the cost of each t-shirt is less than $43.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Since the profit was $215, we know that the difference between the cost and the selling price for each shirt is $43. Let's assume the cost is C and the selling price is S.
