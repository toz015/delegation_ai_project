We know there are 16 books and we have read 19 of them. So there are 16 - 19 = -3 books left unread. Since this isn't possible, it means the question doesn't make sense as stated, or there's missing information. Could you provide more context about what 'available' means? Based on the context, if we assume that the 16 books mentioned include those that haven't been written yet, but don't count as being 'available' until they have been published, then the answer would be 16 - 19 = -3. However, this interpretation may not be accurate based on the information provided, so the question should be reevaluated or clarified.
