The answer is: 14.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Hint 2: How many books have you watched? We can use the fact that the difference between the number of books and movies is 5 (from the problem statement) to find the number of books you've watched. Let's think step by step. The number of movies you've read is 14, as we found in Hint 1. We also know that the difference between the number of books and movies is 5. So if we let the number of books be X, then X - 14 = 5. Solving this equation, we get X = 19. But wait, since we know that there are 10 different books in the series, it follows that you've watched all of them. However, according to the problem statement, you're supposed to have watched 5 more books than movies. This means that you must have read or watched some non-series items as well. But since condition 1 states that all the series items are either books or movies, it contradicts the problem statement that you've watched 5 more books than movies. Therefore, it seems that there is a mistake in the problem statement. I cannot provide a definitive answer without clarifying the situation", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
