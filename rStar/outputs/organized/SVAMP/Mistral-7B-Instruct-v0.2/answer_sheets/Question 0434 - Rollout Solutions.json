Bryan has 7 bookshelves, all of which contain the same amount of books. We need to find the number of books in just one bookshelf. Let's call this number x. Since all the shelves have the same number of books, we know that the number of books in all 7 bookshelves is 7x. But we also know that Bryan has 7 bookshelves and each shelf has x books, so the total number of books is 7x. However, we already know that Bryan has 7 bookshelves and each shelf has 58/7=8.6 books (approximately). That means the actual number of books Bryan has is 7*8.6=58 books. Therefore x=58/7=8.3 approximately. However, since it doesn't make sense to have a fraction of a book, we can assume that Bryan miscounted or rounded an error occurred when he said each bookshelf holds the same number of books.

Since 9 is a multiple of both the number of bookshelves and the desired answer, it might be correct as well. Let's double-check: 9 books per shelf * 7 shelves = 63 books.
