Since 11 students don't want to go, 102 - 11 = 91 students are going. There are 99 seats on a bus, so each bus can take 99 students. To find out how many buses are needed, divide the number of students by the seating capacity per bus: 91 / 99 = 0.9182... which when multiplied by the number of classrooms, gives approximately 91 * 102 = 9212 students, but this is an excessive result. We made a mistake in our calculation. Instead we should divide the number of students who want to attend by the seating capacity of one bus, and round up if the quotient isn't an integer, since you can't fill a bus with a fractional amount of students. In our case, 91 students / 99 seats = 0.9192... which rounds up to 1 student, so 1 more bus is required to accommodate all students.

Therefore, the number of students going on the trip is 102 (total number of students) - 11 (who don't want to go) - 66 (going) = 25.

We do this by dividing the number of students who want to go by the capacity of one bus: 94 / 99 = approximately 0.9523 (rounded to four decimal places). To get the number of buses, we round up to the nearest integer, which results in 1 bus not being enough, so we add 1 more bus: 1 + 1 = 2 buses.
