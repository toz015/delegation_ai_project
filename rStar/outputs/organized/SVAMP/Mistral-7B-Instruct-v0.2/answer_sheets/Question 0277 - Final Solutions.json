We know the area is 10 square feet. To calculate the length of the room based on the given width of 2 feet, let's find out how long the room needs to be for its area to equal 10 square feet.\n\nLength = Area / Width\u00b2\nIn this case:\nLength = 10 / (2)\u00b2\nSimplify the expression:\nLength = 10 / 4\nLength = 2.5\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the length in feet, we should round the result to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 2.5 feet is 3 feet. Therefore, Jesse's room is approximately 3 feet longer than it is wide.\n\nSo the answer is: The room is about 5 feet wide (given condition) and around 6-7 feet long (calculated). However, the exact length isn't mentioned in the instructions or provided by me, I can only tell you it's around 1 foot longer than the width.", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
