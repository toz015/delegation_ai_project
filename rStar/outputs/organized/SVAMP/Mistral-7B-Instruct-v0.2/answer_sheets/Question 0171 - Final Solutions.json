Since there are 30 pencils, then the number of rows must be equal to 30 pencils divided by the number of pencils per row: 30 rows/30 pencils = 1 row/pencil. So there is only 1 row needed, and no pencils are wasted. Therefore, the answer is: 1.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many rows can Faye create?", "subanswer": {"text": "We first incorrectly calculated that each row requires 5 pencils, leading us to believe that 30 pencils would require 6 rows. However, upon further consideration, we realize that there is only enough space for one row, as each pencil occupies its own spot in the row.
