Additionally, Paul lost Y crayons during the school year.

Since the problem statement states that Paul gave away some crayons, it can be assumed that X < 589. Based on this information, let's calculate the answer. First, we need to figure out how many crayons Paul had before gifting and losing any. We know that Paul initially had 589 crayons and then gave some away, leaving him with X crayons.
