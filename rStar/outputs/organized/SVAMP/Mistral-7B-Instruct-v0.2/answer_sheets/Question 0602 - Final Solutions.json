The total revenue was $8835 + $2825 = $11660. Since the difference in price between a jersey and a t-shirt is $90 ($115-$25), we can calculate how many jerseys they sold by dividing their revenue from jerseys by $90: 8835/90. Rounded up, this is 98. But since they only sold 78 jerseys, we must have made an error in our calculation. Let's double check it.
