However, since negative numbers don't make sense in the context of the question, we can conclude that our initial assumption about the number of kids she played tag with on Monday and Tuesday is incorrect. An alternative interpretation could be that the question asks for the number of unique kids she played tag with throughout the week. In this case, the answer is 97 (since all the kids are considered distinct). Alternatively, if we assume that the children who showed up multiple times on different days are still considered unique, then the answer would be 110 (since 15 + 18+97=120, and 120/2 rounded down gives 110).
