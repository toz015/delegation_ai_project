Let's assume a small mistake was made in the problem statement and instead of \"Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug,\" it should read \"Ed had 29 fewer marbles than Doug.\" In this case, our previous reasoning still applies, but the signs for the differences in the number of marbles should be reversed. Thus, Doug had D = 29 marbles initially, and Ed had D = 29-29=0 marbles. But again, this result doesn't hold. To find the correct answer, let's calculate it from first principles: Ed initially had D marbles; Doug had D+29 marbles; the difference between their amounts of marbles was 29. Subtracting Doug's marbles count from Ed's, we get Ed's marbles = D, Doug's marbles = D+29. The difference between their marbles counts is 29, so D - (D+29) = 29 => D = -29, which contradicts reality. Therefore, the assumption about the incorrect sign of the difference between their marbles counts is invalid. Consequently, Ed initially had 29 fewer marbles than Doug.
