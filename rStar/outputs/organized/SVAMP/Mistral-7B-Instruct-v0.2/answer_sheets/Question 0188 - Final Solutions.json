According to the problem statement, the candies are evenly divided between two bags. Since there are 42 pieces of candy, each bag should receive half of them.

Therefore, the first bag will contain 42 - 22 = 20 pieces. But wait! We rounded up for the second bag, meaning we made an error of 1 piece.
