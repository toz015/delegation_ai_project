However, you cannot divide a whole number by another whole number without leaving a remainder unless both numbers are even or odd and their difference is 2. Here, since both numbers are not even nor have the same difference, we need to find the nearest multiple of 3 to 8012 and calculate the difference to know the number of additional buses needed. We see that the nearest multiple of 3 less than 8012 is 8007. Thus, the number of bus seats required is 8007 / 3 which equals 2669.2.
