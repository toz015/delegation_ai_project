Although the swastika has historical roots in several cultures including the Indian subcontinent, its association with Hinduism and Jainism is distinct from the Nazi appropriation of this symbol during the 20th century. Most Hindus and Jains do not use the swastika in their religious practices, especially since the negative connotations associated with it during that period. So, while the swastika has historical ties to these religions, it is not commonly used as a symbol within them today. The answer is: false.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
