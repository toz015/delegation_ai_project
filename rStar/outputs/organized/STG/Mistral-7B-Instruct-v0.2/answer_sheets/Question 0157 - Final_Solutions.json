First, we need to understand that the age of a taxonomic group doesn't depend on the families within that group, but rather on when the earliest member of the group appeared. Mongooses belong to the order Carnivora, which split from the placental mammal stock earlier than rhinos' order Perissodactyla. Thus, mongooses and their families evolved before rhinos and their families. Consequently, the mongoose family is older in terms of evolutionary history than the rhino family.
