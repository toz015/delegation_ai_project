From the given conditions, we know that Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol Empire and may have had a large impact on the genetic makeup of modern populations due to his conquests. Comparing this to Julius Caesar, who also had significant historical influence but no verified connection to modern populations through genetics, we can conclude that a larger percentage of the world population today might potentially trace their ancestry back to Genghis Khan compared to Julius Caesar. The answer is: true.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
