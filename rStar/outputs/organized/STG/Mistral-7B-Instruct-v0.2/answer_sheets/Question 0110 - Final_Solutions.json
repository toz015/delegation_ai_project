Based on the given conditions, we know that swallows and ostriches are both types of birds. However, swallows build relatively small nests using mud pellets and grasses, whereas ostriches build large mounds of debris. Given the significant difference in nest structures, an ostrich cannot fit its body within the nest of a swallow.

Ostrich nests, however, consist of a shallow depression in the ground, lined with twigs and other plant materials.
