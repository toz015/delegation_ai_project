First, let's figure out how many square meters are covered by 200 men standing end-to-end. Each man covers approximately 1.8 square meters when lying down.

Unfortunately, 960 square meters falls short of the 13,120 square meter base area of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

To determine if 200 men can cover the entire base area of the Great Pyramid of Giza with their bodies, we need to find out how much area one man covers when standing end-to-end with another. We assume each man occupies 1 square meter (or 10.76 square feet) of space when lying down. Since each man takes up half that space when standing end-to-end, each man covers about 0.5 square meters (or 5.38 square feet). Therefore, two men cover about 1 square meter (or 10.76 square feet), and 200 men cover approximately 100 square meters (or 1,076 square feet).
