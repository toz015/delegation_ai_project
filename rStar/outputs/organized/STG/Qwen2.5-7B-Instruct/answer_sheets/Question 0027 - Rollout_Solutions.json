Advertising revenue for web search engines like Bing works through a process called sponsored search results. When users perform searches on Bing, advertisers pay to have their relevant ads displayed alongside organic search results. These ads appear based on keywords, user behavior, location, and other factors. When a user clicks on one of these sponsored links, the advertiser pays the search engine a fee.
