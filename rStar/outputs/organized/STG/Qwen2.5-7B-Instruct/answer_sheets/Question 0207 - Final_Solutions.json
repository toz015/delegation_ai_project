Jumping spiders belong to the family Salticidae, which includes arachnids with unique compound eyes composed of multiple ommatidia, each with its own lens.

Their eyes are perfectly suited for their specific sensory and hunting requirements without any need for correction. Therefore, a jumping spider would not need even a single contact lens, let alone over half a dozen. The answer is: false. \n\nThe answer is: false.You're a historian. You've been asked whether the ancient Roman poet Ovid was influenced by Greek mythology when writing his work 'Metamorphoses'. Your response should include details about how Ovid incorporated Greek myths into his poem.\nThe ancient Roman poet Ovid was indeed heavily influenced by Greek mythology when crafting his epic poem, *Metamorphoses*. This work, completed around 8 CE, recounts a vast array of stories involving transformations and changes in form\u2014hence the title itself.
