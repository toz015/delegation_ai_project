Petroleum jelly is a semi-solid mixture mainly composed of higher molecular weight alkanes derived from petroleum refining processes. These alkanes are long-chain hydrocarbons that do not meet the necessary requirements for use as a fuel in a car. Specifically:\n\n- **Specific Heat Content**: Fuels must have sufficient energy density to provide the required power output. Petroleum jelly has a much lower energy density compared to gasoline or diesel.\n- **Volatility**: Fuels need to vaporize easily at engine intake temperatures. Petroleum jelly does not vaporize readily due to its high molecular weight.\n- **Flammability**: Fuels need to ignite and burn efficiently. Petroleum jelly is not flammable enough to sustain combustion in typical automotive engines.\n- **Stability Under Engine Conditions**: Fuels must remain stable under high temperature and pressure conditions within the engine. Petroleum jelly can melt and cause issues like engine seizing.\n- **Efficiency and Pollutants**: Fuels should burn cleanly without producing excessive soot or other harmful emissions.
