WWE Heat typically has a varying duration depending on the specific marathon format, but it generally includes multiple episodes plus additional content like interviews, etc. For simplicity, let's assume a WWE Heat marathon is similar in length to a Bonanza marathon in terms of raw footage without commercial breaks.\n\nGiven these calculations, both marathons would likely take roughly the same amount of time to complete. However, since Bonanza marathons might include only full episodes without additional content, they might finish slightly earlier.\n\nConsidering all factors, a Bonanza marathon would very likely end before a WWE Heat marathon due to its focus solely on episodes versus the inclusion of additional content in WWE Heat marathons.
