Quartz, with its unique structure of silicon and oxygen atoms, contributes to human benefits in multiple ways when in its natural form. Here are some key applications:\n\n1. **Jewelry**: Natural quartz crystals can be cut and polished into gemstones like amethyst, citrine, and rose quartz.\n2. **Decorative Uses**: Natural quartz is often used in decorative items due to its aesthetic appeal and durability.\n3. **Industrial Applications**: Raw quartz is used in the production of semiconductors and other electronic components because of its piezoelectric properties.\n4. **Construction**: Crushed quartz is used as aggregate in concrete and asphalt.\n5. **Technology**: In watchmaking, quartz crystals are used in tuning forks that generate electrical vibrations for accurate timekeeping.\n\nWhile these are beneficial uses, they do not fully capture the specific question about what quartz currently contributes to human benefits directly from its composition alone. Considering only its intrinsic chemical makeup without application, quartz itself does not provide direct human benefit. It is the processed forms and applications derived from its composition that provide benefits.\n\nTherefore, if we strictly consider how quartz contributes to human benefits in its current form (considering both natural and processed forms), the answer is nuanced.
