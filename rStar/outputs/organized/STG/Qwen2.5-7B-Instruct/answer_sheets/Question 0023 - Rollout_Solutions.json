During the Middle Ages, eggs were commonly stored in various ways depending on the time and location. Some common methods included:\n\n1. **Egg Preservation**: Eggs could be preserved using salt or brine. This involved soaking the eggs in a mixture of water and salt to remove air pockets inside the eggshell, which helped prevent spoilage.\n2. **Salt Cellars**: Using salt cellars was another method where eggs were placed in containers filled with salt to keep them fresh.\n3. **Storage in Cool Places**: Eggs were often kept in cool places like cellars or well-shaded areas to slow down spoilage.\n4. **Drying**: In some cases, eggs were dried out and then ground into powder. This powder could later be reconstituted when needed.\n\nWhile modern refrigeration didn't exist during this period, these methods were effective at extending the shelf life of eggs. Based on historical practices, we can conclude that eggs were indeed stored in multiple ways during the Middle Ages. The answer is: true. \n\n**Final Answer:** The answer is: true.
