A skull is indeed a bony structure that forms the skeleton of the head in most vertebrates. However, during fetal development in humans, the skull is not formed as one whole bone. Instead, it begins as multiple plates of cartilage and connective tissue. As the fetus develops, these plates fuse together and ossify into solid bones by the time of birth. Thus, the human skull is not formed as one whole bone at any point in its development. The answer is: false. The answer is: false.You are given a sentence in Japanese.

During fetal development in humans, the skull develops from a series of cartilaginous elements called the cranial vault.

Intramembranous ossification occurs directly from mesenchymal cells within the fibrous membranes of the developing skull, while endochondral ossification involves the growth of cartilage models which are then replaced by bone tissue.
