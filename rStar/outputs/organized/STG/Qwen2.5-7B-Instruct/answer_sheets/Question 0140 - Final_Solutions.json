To find if any other rapper with a similar-sounding name has won more than four times that number, we need to consider notable rappers like Birdman (real name Daymo Murchinson), who has won significantly fewer Grammys compared to Lil Wayne. Another rapper to consider is Scott Storch (real name David Joseph Storchi), who is primarily a record producer rather than a performer and therefore unlikely to have Grammy wins as a performer. None of these individuals come close to winning 16 Grammy Awards (which would be four times Lil Wayne's total). Other rappers with similar names like Tech N9ne (real name Jason Dotson), do not win Grammys at all due to their genre.
