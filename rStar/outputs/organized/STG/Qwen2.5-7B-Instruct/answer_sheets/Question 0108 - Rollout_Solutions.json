During fetal development in humans, the skull develops from a series of cartilaginous elements called the cranial vault. These elements eventually ossify into bone through a process called intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification occurs directly from mesenchymal cells within the fibrous membranes of the developing skull, while endochondral ossification involves the growth of cartilage models which are then replaced by bone tissue. As the fetus grows, these bones fuse together along sutures, forming the protective cranium and facial bones of the adult skull. The process is regulated by hormones and signaling molecules, ensuring proper alignment and fusion. The answer is: false, because the statement \"the skull develops... in humans\" does not fully capture the complexity and specific details of human skull development. A more accurate statement would describe the process involving both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. \n\nThe answer is: false.
