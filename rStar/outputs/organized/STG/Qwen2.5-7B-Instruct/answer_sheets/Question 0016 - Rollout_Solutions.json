While other monarchs also ruled during some part of Columbus's lifetime, these two kings were the most prominent and influential during the early years of Columbus's voyages. The rulers of the Portuguese Empire during Christopher Columbus's lifetime were primarily King Manuel I and King John II. The answer is: false. To clarify, since the instruction asks if they were rulers during Columbus's entire lifetime, which spans different parts of their reigns, the correct answer would focus on both kings' reigns overlapping Columbus's life.
