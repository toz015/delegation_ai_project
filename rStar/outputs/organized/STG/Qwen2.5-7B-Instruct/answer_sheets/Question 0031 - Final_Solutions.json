In the Roman numeral system, MIX is not a valid representation because it does not follow the rules of combining Roman numerals.

However, IX represents 9 (10 - 1), not VIII + X = 18. \n\nMIX cannot be broken down into a valid Roman numeral sequence according to these rules. Furthermore, MIX is not a word in any language.
