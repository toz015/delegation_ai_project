Abortion is intentionally ending a pregnancy. The factors that lead women to consider abortion include unwanted pregnancies, financial constraints, lack of social or familial support, and health concerns.

Various methods of contraception are available, such as hormonal birth control pills, IUDs, implants, and natural family planning.
