A Bengal cat is a breed of domestic cat known for its striking appearance similar to that of leopards or tigers. However, cats do not possess the physical abilities necessary to jump over high bars like human athletes. Even with exceptional agility and athleticism, which some Bengal cats might exhibit, they cannot compete with human records set by athletes like Javier Sotomayor, who specializes in\u8df3\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u867d\u7136Bengal\u732b\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u6377\u548c\u5f3a\u58ee\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8aJavier Sotomayor\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1afalse\u3002\nThe answer is: false. \n\n\uff08\u6ce8\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u6301\u82f1\u6587\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408\u539f\u59cb\u683c\u5f0f\u8981\u6c42\u3002\uff09 The answer is: false. \n\nThis answer is based on understanding that while Bengal cats are very agile and strong, they lack the physical attributes required to jump over high bars like human athletes.
