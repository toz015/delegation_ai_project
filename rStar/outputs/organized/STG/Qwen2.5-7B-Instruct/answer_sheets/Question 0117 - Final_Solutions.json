Given Bloomberg's net worth, he could potentially cover this annual expense without depleting his entire fortune.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that funding the debt alone doesn't necessarily mean solving Micronesia's financial problems. Additional support might be needed for sustainable economic development and stability.\n\nConsidering these points, while it is theoretically possible for Michael Bloomberg to fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade with his current wealth, it is more accurate to say that it is feasible rather than guaranteed.\n\nThus, the answer is: true.

First, we need to determine how much it would cost to fund Micronesia's debt for a decade. According to Hint 1, Micronesia's total external debt is approximately $879 million. To cover this for ten years, we can assume the annual interest on this debt must also be covered. However, the problem doesn't specify whether only the principal amount needs to be funded or if the interest is included, so let's focus solely on the principal amount for simplicity.\n\nNow, we compare this amount to Michael Bloomberg's net worth. According to Hint 2, Michael Bloomberg's net worth is approximately $60 billion. To find out if he can fund the debt:\n\n- Bloomberg's net worth: $60,000,000,000\n- Micronesia's debt: $879,000,000\n\nWe can see that:\n\n$60,000,000,000 > $879,000,000\n\nTherefore, Michael Bloomberg's net worth is significantly larger than Micronesia's debt.
