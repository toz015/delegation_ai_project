Methane, when burned, produces a blue flame. This happens because the energy released from the combustion process heats the surrounding air, causing it to ionize and emit light. Let's try again. Can methane be seen by the naked eye?\nThe answer is: \n\nFalse. Methane itself is invisible, but the flame produced when methane burns can be seen due to the ionization of air molecules around the flame.
