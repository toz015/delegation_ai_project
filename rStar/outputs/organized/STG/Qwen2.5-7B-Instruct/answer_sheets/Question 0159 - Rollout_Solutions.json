Physical Characteristics:\n   - Eagles are adapted for life on land and in the air. They have streamlined bodies designed for swift flight, with long wings and strong tails for maneuverability.\n   - Their feet and talons are sharp and powerful, perfect for grasping and carrying prey, but not for swimming.\n   - Eagles do not have waterproof feathers like ducks or other aquatic birds.
