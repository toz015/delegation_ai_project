Telescopes in astronomy are primarily used for observing and studying celestial objects, such as stars, planets, galaxies, asteroids, comets, and nebulae. They allow astronomers to collect light from distant objects, which can then be analyzed to determine properties like distance, composition, temperature, and motion.

Firstly, they provide much greater magnification capabilities, allowing users to observe fainter and more distant objects. Secondly, they often include features like image stabilization, which reduces blurring caused by hand movement or atmospheric distortion.
