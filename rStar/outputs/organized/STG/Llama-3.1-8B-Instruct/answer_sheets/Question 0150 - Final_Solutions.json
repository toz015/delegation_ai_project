Real-world interactions involving fiction characters can occur at theme parks or similar events through costumes, live performances, meet-and-greets, etc. However, these instances do not count towards encountering characters within the themed environment itself, such as on rides like Space Mountain. Therefore, considering standard operation of such attractions, encountering Bugs Bunny at Space Mountain under normal circumstances is not possible without additional context indicating otherwise.
