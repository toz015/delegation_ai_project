The answer is: true. \n\nBut I'd also say, revisiting my initial interpretation, if we consider a broader context incorporating all the given conditions plus implications of each scenario, especially regarding technological capabilities impacted by the specified changes. Upon careful reconsideration of potential effects on quartz use due to reduced power supplies as a direct result of oxygen unavailability, the reassessment prompts me to refine my original assertion. Ultimately, in this revised understanding acknowledging both direct and indirect impacts, the correct assessment leans towards quartz retaining its fundamental value due to its inherent nature and properties, yet recognizing possible restrictions on practical application stemming from broader consequences. The answer is: true. \n\nGiven the complexity introduced by secondary implications, let's return to core properties and utility directly tied to the mineral itself. The essence of quartz remains unchanged by oxygen levels and doesn\u2019t inherently require electricity.
