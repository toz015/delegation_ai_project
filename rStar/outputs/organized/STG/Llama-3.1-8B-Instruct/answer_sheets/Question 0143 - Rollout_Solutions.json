Since pigs cannot comprehend the purpose or apply the rules in any meaningful way beyond mere physical action, the best interpretation leans towards acknowledging that the premise of the question may be based on a misunderstanding of how Pig Latin works.\n\nHowever, strictly adhering to the letter of the question and focusing on the capability to mechanically apply the rules, one might argue that, in theory, anything capable of performing the necessary actions (e.g., moving letters around) could technically play the game.
