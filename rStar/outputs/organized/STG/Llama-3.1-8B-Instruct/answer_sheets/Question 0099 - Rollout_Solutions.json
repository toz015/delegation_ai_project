His trial and subsequent conviction reflect the strict application of these laws and societal norms.\n-   **Current Standards of Fairness in the US Law:** Today, the United States has evolved its stance on LGBTQ+ rights. Many states have recognized same-sex marriage, and anti-discrimination protections are enacted at both federal and state levels. These advancements signify a shift towards greater acceptance and equality.\n-   **Comparison:** Considering these changes, it's clear that Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would not meet contemporary standards of fairness. The severe punishment he received for consensual adult behavior that is now legally protected in many places would be considered unjustifiable by modern legal and ethical standards.\n\nTherefore, considering the progression from the harsh laws of the past to the more inclusive and equitable environment of the present day, Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would not be deemed justifiable in the United States today.
