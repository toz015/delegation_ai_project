Since dogs (the common hosts of these worms) live in the temperature range conducive to heartworm infestation, they need heartworm prevention. However, since cartoons are fictional and not real entities (like pets), we cannot apply this rule directly. Considering Goofy's anthropomorphic characteristics and assuming him to behave like a living being, he might still be susceptible to certain diseases, but heartworms specifically target specific mammals (such as dogs and cats).

Since Goofy is a cartoon character that resembles a dog, we can consider him to behave similarly to dogs when thinking about health concerns relevant to pets like him. Given that heartworm disease primarily affects dogs, and Goofy being a representation of a dog-like character, we might initially assume that he would need heartworm prevention. However, Goofy is not a real living creature; therefore, the question is actually about a hypothetical scenario rather than a realistic situation regarding pets. The concern about heartworms doesn't apply directly to fictional characters. Thus, assuming Goofy is real, the answer leans towards \"yes,\" considering his hypothetical pet nature, but since he isn't real, this becomes a conceptual exercise rather than an accurate prediction about the real world. This kind of reasoning might lead some to believe the opposite\u2014Goofy wouldn't need heartworm prevention because he isn't a real animal subject to such diseases. The complexity here hints at multiple interpretations based on how one interprets \"hypothetical pet.\" If strictly logical, considering Goofy as a fictional entity immune to real-world diseases, then: The answer is: false. However, within the context of treating a pet resembling Goofy, the correct response might indeed be different, highlighting the confusion around Goofy's status as a pet or non-pet. For clarity and following strict logic given the instructions: The answer is: false. \n\nHowever, let's clarify based on typical interpretation: If considering Goofy as a pet-like character in a theoretical sense, his need for heartworm prevention would depend on his real-life behavior, diet, and exposure to the risk factors, which is not applicable here due to the cartoon nature making him exempt from such risks by default within the realm of fiction. The correct stance should reflect understanding that as a pet, Goofy wouldn't face such real-world threats, thus aligning closer to the initial intuitive answer based on Goofy's cartoon nature. This nuanced interpretation suggests reconsideration might place the answer as leaning towards \"false\" under specific conditions of Goofy being seen as any living creature rather than a protected cartoon character. But in most straightforward assessments based solely on the information given and avoiding deep theory about cartoons and real life mixing, one sticks closely to interpreting instructions, focusing on direct, literal meanings without deeper application or hypothesis.

Given that Goofy is a fictional cartoon character and not a real living being, any physical or biological attributes he has, like needing heartworm prevention, are purely fictional.

Since Goofy isn't a real pet, we cannot determine whether he needs heartworm prevention based on these real-world criteria.

Since Goofy is a fictional character, let's assume he has characteristics similar to those of real pets that might necessitate heartworm prevention.
