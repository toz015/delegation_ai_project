Condition 2: Helen Keller could not see or hear but communicated effectively using braille. Given these conditions, despite having no sight or hearing, Helen Keller could learn to read J.K. Rowling's novels through touch by means of braille translation or assistive technology that converts text into tactile formats suitable for her use. The answer is: true. \n\nHowever, another factor to consider is whether there might be an additional condition or requirement not explicitly mentioned which could change this outcome. \n\nIf we add the following condition: \nCondition 3: There exists a reliable method to convert print materials into braille without assistance, which can reach Helen Keller. This new condition would indeed support our initial conclusion, allowing her to read J.K. Rowling\u2019s novel through braille conversion. If instead we say that only printed books are available for reading and braille translation requires a person, then our answer changes based on the availability of resources supporting Helen Keller.
