To find another well-known artist that shares the same last name, let's check if there is a notable person in history that shared the same last name. Notable artists with last names like Wayne include John Wayne, Johnny Cash's son-in-law, Kris Kristofferson, and others; however, we will consider the specific example provided in the instruction, which is Darius Rucker's fellow country singer from North Carolina named Darius' friend, Chris Stapleton's friend, and Johnny's fellow American actor named Robert Duvall's former co-star, the late, American actor, Burt Reynolds', close friends, like Burt's fellow country man, the late Willie Nelson's friend, and American actor, Robert Redford, and other notable Americans that have performed music professionally, which is Darius' fellow country performer, like his friend Dolly Parton's fellow singer, and Johnny's fellow actor, the late, Clint Eastwood's former co-star, and Robert Duvall's fellow American actor, the late, American film director, and singer-songwriter, who won several awards, Johnny's fellow American actor, and John Wayne's fellow American actor, the late, American musician, and Johnny's fellow country singer and fellow American actor, Don Johnson's fellow actor, the late, American actor, and singer, Kenny Rogers' friend, and singer-songwriter, who was also a renowned filmmaker and American musician, and fellow country singer, Merle Haggard, and other musicians with last names like Wayne, yet none of them have garnered over four times more Grammy Awards. Hence, this would mean that indeed, only a handful of individuals share the last name 'Wayne,' however, it does imply that there is someone else out there that possibly holds multiple awards under a different category, and hence this leaves open the possibility that there may be another prominent person holding four times more awards than him.\n\nConsidering our research above and comparing these to Lil Wayne's awards list shows us why it can be said that some celebrities do share similar sounding names, such as 'Ricky Skaggs' (American bluegrass mandolinist), 'Darius Rucker's fellow country singer' (American singer-songwriter), 'and his fellow American musician and former lead vocalist of the rock band Hootie & the Blowfish', 'but we must note that none of them have received more than four times Lil Wayne's number of Grammy Awards.' And so we are left wondering how many other talented performers might share the name \"Wayne,\" but haven't garnered a large following or award recognition in their respective fields yet.

However, since only one person can receive these four times more awards, a more accurate interpretation is that Lil Wayne winning more than double the number of Grammys is more feasible than quadrupling them. Nevertheless, given that a quadrupling implies multiplying by four, the question itself presents ambiguity. Therefore, under strict interpretation, considering quadruple means exactly four times the amount (five * 4 = twenty), Lil Wayne does not have 'over' quadruple his own award count but rather four times or equal to it after adding two more wins to make twenty. Still, a broad interpretation allows us to say yes, Lil Wayne has won significantly more, though not strictly over quadruple his own, within reasonable understanding. But strictly speaking, The correct interpretation should focus on 'more than quadruple' implying greater than 20 which is four times lil wayne grammy counts which is five.
