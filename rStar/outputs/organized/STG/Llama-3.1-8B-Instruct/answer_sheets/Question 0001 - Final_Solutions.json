This inference stems from two primary considerations:\n\nFirstly, both men shared a commitment to advancing social justice, particularly in the realm of marginalized communities. Both played pivotal roles in history, one in the LGBTQ+ movement and the other as the first African-American U.S. President. Despite some criticisms, Obama's administration showed signs of openness to dialogue and possible policy shifts regarding LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nSecondly, Harvey Milk's pragmatic approach to politics and his willingness to form coalitions suggest that he would have been open to engaging with Obama's administration if they offered opportunities for incremental progress on key issues like LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nHowever, any direct statement of support cannot be made without understanding the nuances of historical context and personal perspectives.
