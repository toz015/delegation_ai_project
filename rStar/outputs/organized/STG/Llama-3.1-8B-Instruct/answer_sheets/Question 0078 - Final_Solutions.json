The answer is: false. \n\nHowever, we can make an educated guess based on what astronaut Jim Lovell said about himself and Neil Armstrong being able to ride a bicycle. This implies a high degree of balance and hand-eye coordination. Unicycling requires these same qualities. So our initial assumption might have been correct that the crew of Apollo 15 has some unicycling potential because of their physical training.\n\nSo if we are going to estimate that any person who has ridden a bicycle will probably have enough skill to ride a unicycle, then yes, given their extensive bike-riding experience, the crew of Apollo 15 would likely have little trouble learning how to ride a unicycle.\n\nThus, we have two different answers here based on reasoning with different assumptions. If we say that all cyclists can ride a unicycle, then the crew of Apollo 15 should be able to learn how to ride a unicycle easily.
