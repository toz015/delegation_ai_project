From historical data, we know that Apple continuously releases new versions of its iPhones with slight improvements over time, but these changes can sometimes be very minor.

Furthermore, looking at major releases alone still favors Apple given its consistency; however, considering the sheer volume of models released across different product lines within a similar timeframe supports Samsung's diversity of offerings, though this varies greatly depending on how you count. The critical comparison lies in how many distinct models each company offers, especially when combining lower-end variants, flagship editions, and special edition phones released over time. Historically speaking, Samsung has shown greater model diversity within its Galaxy line, mainly due to releasing several variants under different names (e.g., Galaxy S, Note, A series) compared to Apple's focus on the 'S' and 'Plus/Pro' series.
