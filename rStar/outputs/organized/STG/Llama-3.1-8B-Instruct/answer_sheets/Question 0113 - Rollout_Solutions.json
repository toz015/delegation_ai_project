We need to compare the duration of both shows. If we assume each episode lasts roughly the same amount of time (ignoring commercials), we can make a rough estimate.

Given that WWE Heat produced more than twice the number of episodes as Bonanza, even assuming each WWE Heat episode lasted only half the length of each Bonanza episode, it would likely take longer to watch all episodes of WWE Heat than Bonanza.
