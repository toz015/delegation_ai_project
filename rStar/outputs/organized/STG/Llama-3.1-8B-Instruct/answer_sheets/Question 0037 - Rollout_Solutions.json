Arnold Schwarzenegger was indeed known for his exceptional physical strength during his competitive bodybuilding days and later.

That being said, some reports suggest he could lift around 600-650 pounds for a single repetition. \n\nWhile we cannot say definitively how much weight Schwarzenegger could deadlift, it is reasonable to conclude that due to his physique and historical achievements in powerlifting, he could likely handle weights in excess of what the average person might expect for someone over the age of 75, even considering muscle loss associated with aging.
