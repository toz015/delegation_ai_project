If plants were unable to undergo photosynthesis due to the absence of chlorophyll, it is indeed possible that most plant species could become extinct because they rely heavily on photosynthesis for their very existence.

The answer is: true. \n\nHowever, considering a broader interpretation focusing strictly on the specific wording of the question regarding the extinction of humanity specifically due to the absence of chlorophyll, a precise assessment might lean towards acknowledging that without chlorophyll, plant life and thus the foundational basis for many ecosystems supporting human existence could collapse, leading to dire consequences, including potentially severe limitations on resources needed for human survival. But, if interpreted narrowly focusing on direct causal linkages leading exclusively to human extinction solely because of chlorophyll absence, then the response needs to consider that the chain of impacts would indeed include a significant threat to human existence due to ecosystem collapse but is best framed within a broader context emphasizing ecological interdependencies and resilience. Hence, considering the broad implications of chlorophyll absence on ecosystems critical to human sustenance and well-being, the correct stance leans towards affirming that the absence of chlorophyll could indeed make humanity vulnerable to extinction due to ecological disruptions caused by the loss of plant life and associated ecosystem services.
