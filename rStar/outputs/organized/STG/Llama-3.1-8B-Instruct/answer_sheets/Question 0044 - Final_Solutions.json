The Gorillaz is a British virtual band consisting of several fictional members: Murdoc Niccals (bassist), Russel Hobbs (drummer), Noodle (guitarist), and 2D (lead vocalist). On the other hand, the actual members of the Gorillaz are just two real individuals: Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. Since two real individuals form the group that creates the music behind the fictional characters, it seems like the Gorillaz is composed of more members than they have.
