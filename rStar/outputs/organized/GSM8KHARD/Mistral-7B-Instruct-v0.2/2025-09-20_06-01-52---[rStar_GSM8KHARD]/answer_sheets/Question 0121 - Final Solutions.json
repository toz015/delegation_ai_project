The answer is: 540.\n\nHint 3: How many legs do mutant invertebrates have? Let's think step by step. Although the exact number isn't mentioned in the problem, we are told that mutant invertebrates have 10 legs. However, since no numerical value is provided for the number of these creatures, it's impossible to calculate their total contribution to the count of legs. The problem only asks about the legs of the spiders and insects present.\n\nSo the answer depends on the information provided. The answer is: Based on the given conditions, the total number of legs observed would be 640 (from the spiders) + 540 (from the insects) = 1180. But this", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
