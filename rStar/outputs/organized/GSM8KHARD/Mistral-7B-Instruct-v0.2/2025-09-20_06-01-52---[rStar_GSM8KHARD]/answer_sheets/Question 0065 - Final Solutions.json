According to condition 1, Jan has 3 times as many pets as Marcia. And according to condition 2, Marcia has 1 more pet than Cindy who has 3336833. Therefore, Jan's number of pets is 3 times Marcia's which is 3 * (Marcia's pet count - 1) = 3 * (3336833 - 1). We need to calculate the exact value of Marcia's pet count first to find Jan's pet count. Since Marcia has 1 more pet than Cindy, Marcia's pet count is Cindy's count plus 1 = 3336834. Substitute this back into our equation, we get Jan's pet count is 3 * (3336834 - 1) = 10006499. Thus, the combined number of pets they have is 3336833 for Cindy + 10006499 for Jan = 13341332.
