From the hint, we find out that doctors work for 40 hours daily. Based on condition 3, doctors charge the hospital $6914510 per hour. Therefore, the total charges per day would be 40 hours * $6914510/hour = $276580400. Next, the patients pay $200 per hour for their appointments. Since there are 500 patients seen daily, the revenue from patients would be 500 patients * $200/patient = $1000000. Finally, the difference between total charges and revenue gives us the profit. That is $276580400 - $1000000 = $275580400.
