First, let's calculate the weight of the other types of feed separately. Sugar cubes come in 1-pound boxes, so the farmer buys 870373 pounds of them. Carrots come in 12-pound bags, so the farmer buys 4 bags which amount to 48 pounds. Hay comes in 75-pound bales, so the farmer buys 4870373 pounds of it.\n\nNow we need to find out the combined weight of all the feed. To do this, add up the weights of each type of feed: 870373 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 4870373 (hay) + 13000 (oats). This sum equals 5850708.\n\nSince the farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the number of trips needed is 5850708 / 2250, rounded up if necessary because the driver cannot take a fractional load.
