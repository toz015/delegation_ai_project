Each horse needs 5 pounds of oats per meal, so they need 5 pounds * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds of oats per day. Uncle Ben wants to feed them for 5 consecutive days. So, the total amount of oats needed for Uncle Ben's horses is 10 pounds/horse/day * 959304 horses * 5 days. This amount is too large to directly convert into bags. However, we know that one bag holds 50 pounds of oats. We can find out how many bags are required to hold this amount by dividing the total amount of oats needed by the capacity of one bag. The calculation would look like this: (10*959304*5)/50= 9593040.
