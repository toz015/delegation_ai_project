The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM (condition 2). Since 1 hour equals 2 centimeters of melted candle length (condition 1), we can calculate the total melted candle length as follows: First we determine how many hours are between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM. An hour is 60 minutes, so 5:00 PM minus 1:00 PM is 4 hours. Since 1 hour equals 2 centimeters, then 4 hours equals 4 times 2, which is 8 centimeters.
