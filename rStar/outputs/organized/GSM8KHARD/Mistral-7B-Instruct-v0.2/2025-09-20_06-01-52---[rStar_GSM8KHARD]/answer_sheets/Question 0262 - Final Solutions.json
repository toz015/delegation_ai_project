First, let's calculate how much Dean spent on toy cars. We know that each car costs $2. But the problem states that Dean bought 5,648,609 cars. This is an error, since it's impossible to write such a large number as an input in this conversation. The largest number we can represent directly is 9,999,999. So, Dean could have bought up to 9,999,999 cars. Let's assume this number instead: Dean spent 9,999,999 * $2 = $19,999,996 on toy cars. Now we need to find out how much money Dean had left before his mother gave him an extra $10. The initial amount was $28, so after spending on the cars, Dean had $28 - $19,999,996 = -$19,999,968.
