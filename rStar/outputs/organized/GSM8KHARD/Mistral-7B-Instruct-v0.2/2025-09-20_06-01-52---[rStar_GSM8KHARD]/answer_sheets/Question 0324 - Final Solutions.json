From condition 1, we know that 1/4 of Movie B's length equals Movie A's length. Let's denote the length of Movie B as X. Therefore Movie A's length is X/4. From condition 2, Movie B lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes (or 75 minutes) and is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie C runs for 1 hour or 60 minutes. We can calculate Movie B's length as follows: X = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes. Since Movie A's length is 1/4 of Movie B's length, it runs for 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes. To convert hours into minutes, multiply hours by 60. Here, Movie A runs for 20 minutes, which is equal to 20 * 60 = 1200 seconds or 1 hour and 20 minutes.
