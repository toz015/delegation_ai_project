We know that 6 years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, who is currently 46. This means Noah was 46/2 = 23 years old then. According to condition 2, the population of Chile was 3000*23=69,000. However, we need to consider that 6 years have passed since then. Chile's population grows, so its current population would be larger than 69,000. Without knowing the exact growth rate of Chile's population, it's impossible to determine the exact number.
