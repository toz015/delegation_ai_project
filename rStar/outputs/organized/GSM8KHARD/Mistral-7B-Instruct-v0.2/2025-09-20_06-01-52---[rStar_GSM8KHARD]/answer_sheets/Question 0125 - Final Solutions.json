He spends 1/4 of his monthly salary on rent, which is 1500 dollars. He spends 1/3 of his monthly salary on car fuel, which is 6000 * 1/3 = 2000 dollars. Together they take 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars.\n\nNext, let's calculate what's left over after subtracting both rent and car fuel costs. We know that 3500 dollars is taken away from Zaid's 6000 dollars. To get the remaining amount, we can simply subtract 3500 from 6000: 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.\n\nFinally, half of this remaining amount (2500) goes to charity. Thus, the total amount of money Zaid still has left is 2500 / 2 = 1250 dollars.\n\nSo, the answer is: 1250.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
