Let's say there are x girls. Then there are 2x boys. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we have x (girls) + 2x (boys) = 3x. Solving this equation, we find x = 1/3 x (3x). Given that the number of girls must be a whole number, we reject this solution since 1/3 is not a whole number. Thus, we need another solution where x is a multiple of 2. We try x = 2, so that there are 4 girls and 8 boys. This makes a total of 12 students. However, the instruction says that there are 15 students. This means our assumption of having 4 girls and 8 boys was incorrect. Let's try again, assuming there are 5 girls initially. Then, there would be 10 boys. Together, there are 5 + 10 = 15 students.

We can substitute the values of g and 2g for the number of girls and boys respectively, so our equation is g+2g=5t. Simplifying it, we get 3g=5t, therefore g=5t/3 and boys=2g=10t/3. To find out if it's possible to have a whole number of students, we need to check if both girls and boys are integers. If 5t/3 and 10t/3 are integers, then t is an integer and thus the number of teachers is t.
