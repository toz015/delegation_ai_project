This isn't the exact number of eggs that won't fit since the capacity is greater than what's needed, but it is the difference between the capacity and the number of eggs Jaime has, which represents the excess capacity that could accommodate additional eggs. Since no such additional eggs exist, these extra eggs are essentially 'unused' or 'unoccupied'. Therefore, the actual number of eggs not placed on the tray remains 0.

Since we don't know if Jaime can exactly fill those extra spaces or not, it depends on whether 64 eggs fit perfectly into 2 trays or not. Let me assume the worst case scenario: the trays cannot fit exactly 64 eggs. In such a case, Jaime would need to transfer some eggs to another tray to make it possible to put all eggs onto the trays. This situation may cause some loss of eggs.
