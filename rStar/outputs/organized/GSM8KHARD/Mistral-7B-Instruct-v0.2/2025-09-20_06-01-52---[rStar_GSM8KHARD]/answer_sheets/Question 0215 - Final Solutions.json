First, we know that 8 packets of chocolate bars can feed 4 adults and 8 children. We calculate that 4 adults get 193432 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars each child gets, we need to find out how many chocolate bars remain.\n\nWe know that 1 packet of chocolate contains enough chocolate bars for 1 adult and 2 children. That means that 1 packet contains 48358 + 2 * (number of chocolate bars a child gets). Let's denote the number of chocolate bars a child gets as X. We know that the number of chocolate bars for children is equal to the number of packets for children.\n\nSo, 8 = (number of packets for children) => 8 * X = number of chocolate bars for all children => X = number of chocolate bars for one child / (1 + 2/4) => X = 1/3 * number of chocolate bars per person.\n\nNow we know that each adult eats 48358 chocolate bars and each child eats 1/3 * number of chocolate bars per person. So the total number of chocolate bars is", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
