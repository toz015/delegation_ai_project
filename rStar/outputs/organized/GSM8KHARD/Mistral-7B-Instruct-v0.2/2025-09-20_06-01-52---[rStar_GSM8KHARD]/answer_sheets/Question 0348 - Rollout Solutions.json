There are three groups, and each group consists of 200 employees. Each group received 3647764 tour guides.

Since it is not possible to have a fraction of an employee, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each group has 30401 employees.

The correct calculation is as follows: Since there are 3 groups and each group consists of 200 employees, the total number of employees is 3*200=600.

To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to multiply the number of employees in one group by the number of tour guides per employee: 30401 employees/group * 607 tour guides/employee = 185675521 people.
