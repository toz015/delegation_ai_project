After baking for 2 hours, the temperature rises by 10 degrees. Therefore, the temperature after baking but before opening the window is 40 + 10 = 50 degrees. Opening the window for 30 minutes causes the house temperature to decrease by 1 degree per minute for the first 10 minutes, then 2 degrees per minute for the next 10 minutes, and finally back to 1 degree per minute for the last 10 minutes. So the net decrease caused by opening the window is 1 degree for the first 10 minutes, 2 degrees for the second 10 minutes, and 1 degree for the third 10 minutes, or a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 degrees.

First, we know that the initial temperature inside the house when Marcus wakes up is 40 degrees. During the next 3 hours while baking, the temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour.
