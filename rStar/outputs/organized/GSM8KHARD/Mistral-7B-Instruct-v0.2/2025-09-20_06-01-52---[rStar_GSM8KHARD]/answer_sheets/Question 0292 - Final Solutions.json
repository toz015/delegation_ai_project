We're told the ratio of their popsicles is 5:6, so mathematically speaking, it can be represented as x = (5/11)y. Substitute y = 11x/5 into the equation, we get x = (5/11)(11x/5) = 11x/5^2 = 11x/25. Rearrange this expression to find y: y = 5^2x/11. Given the total number of popsicles is 9381115, we can write x + y = 9381115. Subtract x from both sides of the equation to get y = 9381115 - x. Substitute our expression of x in terms of y (x = 11y/5) back in, we get y = 9381115 - 11y/5. Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear out the fraction, we have 5y = 46905575 - 11y.
