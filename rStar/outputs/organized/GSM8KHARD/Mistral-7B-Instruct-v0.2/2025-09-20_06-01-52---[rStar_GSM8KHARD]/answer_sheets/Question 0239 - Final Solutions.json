At first, the temperature decrease from each ice cube is 13 degrees. So, if we add 'x' ice cubes, the total temperature decrease will be 13 * x. Once the temperature reaches 65 degrees, Shannon adds 15 ml of cream. Before adding the cream, the volume of coffee was reduced by 12 ml for each ice cube, so the total volume reduction due to ice cubes would be 12x ml. Finally, we need to find out the final volume of the coffee including both the ice cubes and the cream. Since the coffee's initial volume remains constant when ice cubes melt, the difference between the initial volume and the final volume (including ice cubes and cream) equals the sum of volumes of the added ice cubes and the added cream. We know that 1 liter = 1000 ml, so if the initial volume is V ml, then the final volume V + 13x + 15 = 1000. Solving this equation, we get: V = 1000 - 13x - 15.

For every ice cube added, the volume decreases by 12 ml while the temperature drops by 13 degrees. If we assume that the coffee is initially hotter than the required serving temperature of 65 degrees, then the coffee will cool down enough to reach 65 degrees once a sufficient number of ice cubes have been added. At that point, we add 15 ml of cream. Since we don't know the initial volume V, we cannot find the exact final volume. However, we can find the difference between the initial and final volumes, which is the lost volume due to the ice cubes. We've determined that the cooling caused by n ice cubes corresponds to a volume loss of 12nl ml. When the coffee cools down to 65 degrees, its volume change stops since no further ice cubes are being added. Thus, the initial temperature difference between the final temperature and the original temperature of 13 degrees is equal to the volume loss per degree C (since 1 degree = degree), or, the final volume of the equation = 13\u00b0C = 12 ml/\u00b0C/\u00b0C \u00d7 12 ml/\u00b0C for every ice cube that's removed from the coffee's initial volume per cup of hot coffee is 12 ml. So, if the initial volume of the coffee is V, the volume loss due to n ice cubes is 12nl ml. The final volume of the iced coffee is V - 12nl.
