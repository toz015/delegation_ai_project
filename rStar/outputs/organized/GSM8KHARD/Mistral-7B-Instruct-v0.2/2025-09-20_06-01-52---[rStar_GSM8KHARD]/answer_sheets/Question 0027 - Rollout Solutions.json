Condition 1 states that the age difference between Brandon's iPhone and Ben's iPhone is a multiple of four. Condition 2 says Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, which is one year old. So Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old. Since the difference between their ages is a multiple of four, we can find the age of Brandon's iPhone by adding multiples of 4 to Ben's age until it matches the condition. We need to add enough multiples of 4 to 2 to make the result a multiple of 4 greater than Ben's age. Let's try 4, then check if the difference is a multiple of 4. Adding 4 to 2 results in 6. Subtracting Suzy's age (1) from Brandon's age (6), we have 5. Checking if 5 is a multiple of 4, it is. So the age of Brandon's iPhone is 5.
