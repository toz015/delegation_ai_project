Therefore, our initial value for Luke's hot dogs was incorrect. We need to adjust the values for Thomas and John accordingly. Since Luke ate less than Thomas, Luke's share must have been a quarter of their combined total, not a fifth. So Thomas ate 5 * 4/5 = 4 hot dogs, and John ate 4 / 2 = 2 hot dogs.

Since we already know that Luke ate 2 hot dogs, it seems unlikely that both Thomas and John ate more hot dogs than Luke. Instead, Luke must have eaten a smaller portion than initially stated. To make things fit, let's assume Luke ate only a quarter of the total amount of hot dogs they consumed. That leaves Thomas with 3 quarters and John with half of Thomas's portion, or 3/2 hot dogs. Since 3/2 hot dogs cannot exist, this indicates that our assumption about Luke's portion being a quarter was incorrect.
