If senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, we can write this as a equation: salary_senior = salary_junior + $400. We know that the total number of employees is 2851496. Let's call the number of senior programmers S and the number of junior programmers J. From the information above, we can write another equation: S + J = 2851496. We don't have enough information to solve these equations directly. However, since this question is asking about the number of junior programmers, let's try to find it. We'll make the assumption that there are more junior programmers than senior programmers. This assumption might not be true, but it's worth trying. If we assume there are N senior programmers, then the number of junior programmers would be N+1, N+2, etc. We can test this assumption by checking if (N + (N + 1)) is close enough to 2851496. We can start testing with small values of N.

From our first equation, we know that one junior programmer earns $2000 per month. Since there are 2/5 = 0.4 times as many junior programmers as total employees, there are 2851496 * 0.4 = 1140598.4.
