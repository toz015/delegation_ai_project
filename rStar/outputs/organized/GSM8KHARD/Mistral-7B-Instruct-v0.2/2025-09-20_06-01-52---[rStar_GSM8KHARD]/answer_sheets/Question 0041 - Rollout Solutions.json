Each cluster has 7077300 fruit, and there are 6 such clusters. The total number of fruit in all those clusters would be 6 * 7077300 = 42463800. We know the total number of fruit is also 6 clusters * 7077300/cluster + 67 individual fruits = 42463827. Since both numbers are equal, the difference between them is zero. Therefore, the number of extra fruit (which is individual fruits) should be zero. But we already accounted for 67 of them. This means there are no extra individual fruits, so our initial assumption about having 67 individual fruits was wrong. To find the correct number of clusters, let's set up the equation again: 6 clusters * total fruit per cluster = total fruit. Solving this equation, we get 6 clusters * total fruit per cluster = 42463827. Dividing both sides by the number of fruit per cluster, we obtain 6 clusters = 42463827 / 7077", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "However, it seems like the number 7077 is a typo or a mistake. Let's assume the correct number is actually 707 instead. With this assumption, we can calculate the total number of clusters: 6 clusters = 42463827 / 707 => 6 clusters \u2248 5957. Since we cannot have a fraction of a cluster, let's round down to 5956 clusters. Multiplying that by the number of fruit in a single cluster, we get 5956 clusters * 707 fruit/cluster = approximately 4212519.
