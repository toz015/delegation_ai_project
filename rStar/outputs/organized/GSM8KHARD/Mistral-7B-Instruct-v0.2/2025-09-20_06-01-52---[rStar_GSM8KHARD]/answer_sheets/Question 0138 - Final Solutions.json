Each crayon costs $2 (as per Hint 2), so she spends 482795 * $2 = $965589 (as per Hint 3) on crayons. Since we are asked about the change, let's first find out the total amount of money Violetta has, and then subtract the amount she spent on crayons to get her change. Let's assume Violetta has $X in total. That means she has $X - $965589 as change. To solve for X, we set up the equation X = $965589 + ($X - $965589). Solving for X, we get X = $1931178.
