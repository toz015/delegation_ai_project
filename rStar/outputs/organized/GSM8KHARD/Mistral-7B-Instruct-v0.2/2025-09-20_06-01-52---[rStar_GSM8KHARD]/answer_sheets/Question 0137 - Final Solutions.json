However, this doesn't take into account the trees he chops down or those that died naturally. To find out how many trees Tom has left, we need to calculate the total number of trees he's had over those ten years and subtract those that have either been chopped down or died naturally.\n\nFirst let's figure out the total number of trees he has had in the 10 years. Since Tom plants 10 trees per year, he has planted a total of 100 trees (10 trees/year * 10 years). However, since Tom also chops down 5,074,414 trees every year, the total number of trees Tom has had in these 10 years is 100 trees (the ones he planted) + 5,074,414 trees (the ones he chopped down) = 5,084,424 trees.\n\nNext, let's determine the number of trees that naturally died due to condition 4.
