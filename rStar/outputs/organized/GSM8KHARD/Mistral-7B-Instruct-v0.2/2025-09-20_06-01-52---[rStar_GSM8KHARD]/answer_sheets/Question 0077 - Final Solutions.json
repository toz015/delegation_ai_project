Cleaning the whiteboard once takes time, but we need to figure out how often it gets cleaned during a typical day or lesson.\n\nHint 2: Assuming that a teacher might teach multiple lessons in a day, let's consider the cleaning frequency per hour instead. If a teacher teaches one lesson every hour, then the number of lessons taught in a day is equal to the number of hours in a day.\n\nWith this knowledge, we can calculate the number of cleanings needed for all teachers' lessons in a day. Recall that the whiteboard needs to be cleaned three times during each lesson. Thus, the total number of cleanings required for all teachers per day would be (number of lessons per day) * (cleanings per lesson). Let's find this value.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of lessons per hour based on the information provided earlier, which is that there is one teacher using the whiteboard twice", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
