Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we calculate Dorothy's number of friends by dividing Charlie's number of friends by 3. This results in Dorothy having approximately 637194 friends. However, since people cannot have a fraction of a friend, we assume Dorothy has 637195 friends instead. Now we move on to finding out how many Facebook friends James has. It is stated that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Using this information, we calculate James's number of Facebook friends by multiplying Dorothy's number of friends by 4. This results in James having around 2552780 friends.
