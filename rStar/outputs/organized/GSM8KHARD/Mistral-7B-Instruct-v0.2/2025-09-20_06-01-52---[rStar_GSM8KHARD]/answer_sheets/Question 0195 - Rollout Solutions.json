The condition states that Mr. Tan sells his house for $400 000. Condition 2 indicates that he pays transfer fees which are equal to 3% of this amount. This means he pays $12 000 (3% of $400 000). Similarly, condition 3 reveals that he also pays brokerage fees which are equivalent to 5% of the same amount, thus he pays an additional $20 000 (5% of $400 000). Therefore, the total amount of money Mr. Tan spends on transactions fees is $12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000. Subtracting this from the selling price leaves him with $368 000 ($400 000 - $32 000). However, the remaining condition 4 states that his house loan amounts to $250 000.
