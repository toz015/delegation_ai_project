We know that a pizza can serve 3 people, so we divide the total number of attendees by 3. This results in approximately 9572623908 pizzas being needed. Since the price of one pizza is $15, she would spend 9572623908 x $15 = 14308935932 dollars. The answer is: 14308935932.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
