The answer is 33,606,725.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that 6721345 containers came first, and each one held 5 vehicles. So there were 6721345 * 5 = 33,606,725 vehicles. Then, on the second day, the number of vehicles increased to 30. So, the difference between these numbers can tell us how many vehicles were in the additional containers. That would be 33,606,725 - 30. The answer is 33,606,725 - 30 = 33,606,722.\n\nNow we need to determine how many containers hold this amount of vehicles. Since 5 vehicles fit in one container, we divide the total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container. 33,606,722 / 5 = 6,721,344. The answer is 6,721,344. Therefore, there were 6,721,344 containers that arrived at the port on the second day.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 12}]
