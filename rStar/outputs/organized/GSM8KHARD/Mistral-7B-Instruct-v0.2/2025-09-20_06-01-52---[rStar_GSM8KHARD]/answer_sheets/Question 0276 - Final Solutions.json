The company spends 4326221 on equipment. 40% of that amount is spent on faulty equipment. To find out how much, we need to multiply the total cost by 40% (which is expressed as 0.4 as a decimal). So 4326221 x 0.4 = 17296884.4. However, we know that the answer needs to be a single number, so it appears our calculations led us to an incorrect conclusion.
