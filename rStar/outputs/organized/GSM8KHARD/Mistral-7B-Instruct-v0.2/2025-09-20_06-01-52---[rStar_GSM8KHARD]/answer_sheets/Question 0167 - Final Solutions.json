Her mother puts together half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute. The answer is 2.\n\nHint 3: How long does it take for Kalinda to put together one piece of the puzzle? It takes Kalinda 60 seconds (or 1 minute) to put together 4 pieces, so it takes her 1 minute to put together 1 piece. The answer is 1.\n\nHint 4: How long does it take for Kalinda's mother to put together one piece of the puzzle? Since her mother puts together 2 pieces per minute, it takes her 1 minute to put together 1 piece. The answer is 1.\n\nCombining these answers, we see that both Kalinda and her mother can put together 1 piece every minute.
