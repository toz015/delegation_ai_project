Eliza earns a base wage of $1616598 per week for working 40 hours. This week, however, she worked for 45 hours, so she also earned overtime wages. Overtime wages are calculated as 1.2 times her hourly rate. Since she makes $1616598 per week while working 40 hours, we can figure out what she earns per hour by dividing her weekly earnings by the number of hours she works per week: $1616598 / 40 = $40415. Since she works overtime for 5 hours, her overtime earnings would be 5 hours * $40415/hour = $202075. Adding her base pay and overtime pay together, we get $40415 + $202075 = $605962.
