Let's call the price of one pair of heels 'x'. Therefore, the second pair would cost '2x'. According to the problem statement, 'x' + '2x' is five dollars less than the price of the boots. Mathematically, this can be written as: '3x' = cost_of_boots. Since x is the price of one pair of heels, it can be considered as part of the total cost of three items (boots + 2heels), which sum up to cost_of_boots+cost_of_pair1+cost_of_pair2. We know that cost_of_pair1+cost_of_pair2 is five dollars less than cost_of_boots. Therefore, cost_of_boots+cost_of_pair1+cost_of_pair2 = 3x+x+x = 3x+2x = 5x.
