Misha picked out 1107008 blouses. Each one costs 20 dollars less when on sale, so the difference between the sale price and the regular price is 20 dollars.

We know the sale price is 1107008 x 20 dollars less than the regular price, or 1107008 x 20 dollars = 22140160 dollars. You can find the regular price by adding that value back to the sale price.
