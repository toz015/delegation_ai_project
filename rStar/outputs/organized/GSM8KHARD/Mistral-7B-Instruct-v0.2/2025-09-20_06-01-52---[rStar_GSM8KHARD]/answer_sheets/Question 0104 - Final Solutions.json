Food items are milk and eggs. Milk costs 2 dollars. Eggs cost 3 dollars. The total amount spent on food items is 2 dollars (for milk) + 3 dollars (for eggs) = 5 dollars.

Non-food items include light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. \n\nHint 2: Find out how much John spent on non-food items. Light bulbs cost 3 dollars. Cups cost 3 dollars. Roach traps cost 4 dollars. The total amount spent on non-food items is 3 dollars (for light bulbs) + 3 dollars (for cups) + 4 dollars (for roach traps) = 10 dollars.\n\nSince there is a 10% sales tax applied to non-food items, we need to add 10% of 10 dollars to get the total cost of these non-food items. To find 10%, multiply the cost of non-food items by 0.1: 10 * 0.1 = 1 dollar. Add this to the original 10 dollars: 10 dollars (non-food items) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars.\n\nSo the total cost of John's purchases, including taxes, is 5 dollars (food items) + 11 dollars (", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
