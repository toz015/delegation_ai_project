According to the instructions, the number of rubies equals 1007458 - X, while emeralds count double the number of rubies. Based on these clues, let's calculate the number of rubies and emeralds respectively.\n\nFirstly, we use the relationship between the number of rubies and emeralds to determine the number of rubies: if emeralds count double the number of rubies, then the number of emeralds is 2 times the number of rubies. Thus, we can set up the equation E = 2R, where E is the number of emeralds and R is the number of rubies. This equation tells us that the number of rubies is half the number of emeralds.\n\nSecondly, we know the number of rubies according to condition 2: the number of rubies is 1007458 - X. Our goal is to find X, so that we can get the correct number of rubies using this information.
