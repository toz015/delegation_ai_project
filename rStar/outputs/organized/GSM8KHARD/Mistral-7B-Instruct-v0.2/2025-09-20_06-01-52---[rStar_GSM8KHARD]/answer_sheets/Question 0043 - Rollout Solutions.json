To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of material ($500) to the cost of construction. Let's call the cost of construction X. So, Janet paid $500 (material) + X (construction) + 10% of (X+$500). We know that the insurance cost was 10% of the total, so we can set up the equation: $500+X = 1.1 * ($500+X), which can be solved to get X = $4,258,833.
