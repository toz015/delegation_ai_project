Bike costs 300 dollars. The difference, 250 dollars, is what Mark needs to save up. Mark earns 1,736,265 dollars each day. To find out how many days it takes him to save up 250 dollars, we divide the difference by his daily income: 250/1,736,265. Unfortunately, this results in a decimal value which represents a fraction of a day. Since Mark can't work or save part of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day. This adds 1 to our result.
