First, we determine how many sandwiches can be made with the available meat and cheese. Since each sandwich requires one pound of both meat and cheese, the amount of sandwiches that can be made is the total pounds of meat and cheese divided by 2 pounds per sandwich (one pound of meat and one pound of cheese). Therefore, the number of sandwiches is 1 pound of meat * 5979089 people / (1 pound of meat per sandwich * 2 pounds per sandwich) = 2989544.5. Since you cannot make half a sandwich, we need to round up and get 2989545 sandwiches.\n\nNext, since each sandwich serves 4 individuals, the total number of individuals served is 2989545 sandwiches * 4 people per sandwich = 11958180.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost of the meat: The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
