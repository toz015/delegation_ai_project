Griffin had 27 fries left.\n\nHint 4: How many fries did Ginger give Griffin? To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries that everyone else took away from the initial number of fries (Griffin's) and then find the difference between this result and the final number of fries that Griffin had. \n\nFirst let's find out how many fries Kyle took.
