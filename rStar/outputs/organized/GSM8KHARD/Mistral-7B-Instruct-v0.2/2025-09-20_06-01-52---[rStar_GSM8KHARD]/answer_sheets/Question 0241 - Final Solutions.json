Based on the condition that it takes 3 minutes to charge 1%, we need to determine how many minutes it would take to charge 40% (which is 40 steps from 60%) and also 100% (an additional 41 steps from 60%). Since charging from 60% to 71% (a 11% increase) requires 5 iterations (as we can see from the hint), each iteration adds 3.4 minutes (since 1% takes 3 minutes). Therefore, it takes 5 * 3 = 15 minutes to charge from 60% to 71%. To charge another 10 percentage points, it would require 5 more iterations.
