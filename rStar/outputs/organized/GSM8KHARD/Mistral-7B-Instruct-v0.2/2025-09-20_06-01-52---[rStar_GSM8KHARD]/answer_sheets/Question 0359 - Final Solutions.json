The child wants a toy car worth 14050127 dollars but he currently has only 4 dollars. To find out how long it takes for him to earn enough money for the car, we need to determine how many days it will take him to save $4050123 (the difference between the cost of the car and what he already saved). Divide the remaining amount by the amount of money he saves daily. 14050123/4050127 = 3.467 days. Since he cannot save partial days, he will need to save for this amount of time plus one full day, making it a total of about 4 days more than 3 days. The answer is: The answer is: 4 days (plus some hours) more than 3 days.
