To find this, divide the number of miles he covers by the number of hours he spends running. Since he runs for 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on the other days, his total weekly running time is 3 hours + 1.5 hours*2 = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours. His average running speed is 8.57 miles/day / (6 hours/week) = 8.57 miles/hour. The answer is: 8.57 miles/hour.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
