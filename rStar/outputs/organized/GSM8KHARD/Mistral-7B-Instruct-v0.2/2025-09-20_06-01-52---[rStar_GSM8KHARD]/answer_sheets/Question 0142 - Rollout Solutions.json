Let X represent the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month. In the second month she collected 3X cards, so she collected a total of X+3X=4X cards in the first and second months. In the third month she collected 2(X+3X)=2X+6X=8X cards. Since the number of cards Elaine collected in all three months is the same as what she had initially, we know that X+4X+8X=8037029. Simplifying this equation, we get X=8037029/13=626315.23. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a card, it seems that this problem may not have a valid solution.
