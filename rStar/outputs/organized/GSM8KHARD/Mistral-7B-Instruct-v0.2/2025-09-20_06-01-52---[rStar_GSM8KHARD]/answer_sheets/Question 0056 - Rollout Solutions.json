Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry (Condition 1). Raymond does half that amount, so he does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds (Condition 2). Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Let's find out how much David does: David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4 = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds. Now we know that Sarah does 400 > 100 > 200 pounds of laundry. So the range is 100 < Sarah's laundry < 400. To narrow it down, since Sarah does more than twice as much as Raymond, we can conclude that Sarah's laundry is greater than 2 x 200 = 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. Since Sarah does less than four times as much as David, we can also conclude that Sarah's laundry is less than 4 x 100 = 400 pounds.

We could choose Sarah to round up and Raymond to round down, making the difference a whole number. Or we could choose Sarah to round down and Raymond to round up. Both ways result in different differences. If we round Sarah up and Raymond down, Sarah does 400 pounds and Raymond does 100 pounds. That's a difference of 300 pounds.
