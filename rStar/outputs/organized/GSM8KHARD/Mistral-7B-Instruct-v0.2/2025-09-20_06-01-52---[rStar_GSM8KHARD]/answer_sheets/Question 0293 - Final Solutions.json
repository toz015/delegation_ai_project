Erica made 9770567 cards for others (Condition 1). She received 17 cards (Condition 4) and passed out 24 cards (Condition 3), so those were not cards she made herself. She also had 2 boxes of pre-made cards, which contained 15 cards each (Condition 2), so she had 15 x 2 = 30 cards that she didn't make. Therefore, the number of cards she made herself is the total number of cards minus the ones she received, passed out, and received pre-made: 9770567 - 24 - 5 - 30 = 9770538.
