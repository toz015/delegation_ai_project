Marisa gets $5 per day. In 5 days, she receives $5 * 5 = $25. However, all of this money is spent on lollipops costing 25 cents each. Since 1 dollar equals 100 cents, each lollipop costs 25 cents, which means she buys 25 cents worth of lollipops every day. Therefore, for 5 days, she spends $25 in total. Since she always saves whatever change remains, she won't have any savings.

Because she has no extra money left and all her daily allowance goes into buying lollipops, none of the money remains for her piggy bank on a daily basis.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about savings over 5 days, it implies that there might be leftover change during those 5 days that could accumulate in her piggy bank. It's impossible to know if this condition is met without specific information, but assuming that such an occurrence does happen, let's calculate how much Marisa could potentially save during these 5 days.\n\nLet x represent the change from the purchase of the last lollipop on Day 5. Since each lollipop costs 25 cents, we can write the equation 5.25 = 5 * 0.25 + x. Solving for x, we find that x = 0.75. Marisa saves 0.75 dollar on the fifth day.
