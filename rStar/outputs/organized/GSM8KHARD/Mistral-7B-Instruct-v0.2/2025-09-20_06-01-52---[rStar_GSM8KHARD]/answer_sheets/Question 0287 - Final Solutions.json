Since Wilson's grade cannot be less than 0 or greater than 100, and the current grade of 62.8 does not meet these requirements, it seems likely there was an error when adding up the test scores or calculating the average. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully double check the numbers given for the test scores, especially making sure that there is indeed a total of 5 test scores being considered. Once the correct numbers have been identified, the process of finding the average can be repeated. For reference, assuming the 5 given test scores are accurate, the average would be calculated as follows: Sum of Test Scores (314) divided by Number of Tests (5) equals Average Grade (62.8).
