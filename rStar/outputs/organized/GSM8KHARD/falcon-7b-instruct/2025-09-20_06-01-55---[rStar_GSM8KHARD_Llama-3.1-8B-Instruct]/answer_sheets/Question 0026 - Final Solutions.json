Dana can run at a rate of speed 4 times faster than she can walk. We know that this is equivalent to saying she can run at a speed of 8 miles per hour. Let's think about how many miles per hour she can run if she can run at a speed of 8 miles per hour. We can write 8 miles per hour as 8 x 60 minutes per hour = 400 miles per hour. 400 miles per hour is equivalent to 250 miles per hour. 250 miles per hour is equivalent to 125 miles per hour.

One day is equal to 2 x 5/2 miles. So one day is equal to 5/4 miles. One day is equal to 1.25 x 5/4 = 1.5 miles. So in 1.5 miles, she travels 5/4 miles.
