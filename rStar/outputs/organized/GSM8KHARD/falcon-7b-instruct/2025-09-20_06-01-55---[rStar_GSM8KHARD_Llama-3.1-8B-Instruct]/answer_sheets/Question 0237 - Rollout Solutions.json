The ratio of electric poles and electric wires is 1:3. 1 in 3 = 1/3. If we want to find the total number of poles needed for 488225 electric wires, we can start by finding the length of each wire. The length of each wire is 1000 meters. So 488225 meters is equal to 1000 x 48825 = 488,225 meters. If we want to find the number of poles needed, we can use the formula p = (r * x)/q, where p is the number of poles required, r is the radius of the wires, x is the distance between two points, and q is the number of poles needed to connect the wires. We know that the radius of the wires is 3 meters. So the formula becomes: p = (3 * 488,225)/4. When we plug in the numbers, we get p = (3 * 488,225) = 152,750.
