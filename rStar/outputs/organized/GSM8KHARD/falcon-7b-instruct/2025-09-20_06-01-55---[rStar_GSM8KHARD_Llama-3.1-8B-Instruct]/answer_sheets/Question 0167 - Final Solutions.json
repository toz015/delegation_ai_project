First, let's calculate how long it would take Kalinda alone to add 4 pieces per minute. 4 * 1 minute = 4 seconds. In 4 seconds, she can add 4 pieces. So it will take her 4 + (4 x 2) = 6 seconds to add 4 pieces per minute. Kalinda is normally able to add 4 pieces per minute, so it will take her 4 * 2 = 8 seconds to add 4 pieces. Then we have to subtract the time taken by her mom. Let's say her mom takes 4 + (2 x 1) = 6 seconds to add 2 pieces per minute. Therefore, it will take her 8 + 6 = 14 seconds to add 4 pieces per minute. We can use the same formula for Kalinda. So it will take her 4 x 4 = 16 seconds to add 4 pieces per minute.
