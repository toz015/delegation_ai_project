So we have -198419740 + 5 = -198419740 + 5, which simplifies to 198419740 = -198419740. We know that the number of apples Morisette brought is 5, so we can solve for 198419740: -198419740 = 5 - 198419740 or -198419740 = 5.

We have two equations that we can solve for: -198419740 = 5 or -198419740 = 5 + 5. Since -198419740 = 5, we know that -198419740 = 5 + 5.

We have two equations, so we can use the first one to eliminate the second one: -198419740 = 5. We can solve for -198419740: -198419740 = 5 + 5 or -198419740 = 5.
