So he runs 5000 * 1/5 = 10000 meters per day. To train to run more meters per day, he needs to increase the distance he's running every day. Now we can answer the question: How much distance does Tyson need to cover per day, training to run more meters per day, so he can cover the distance he needs? Answer 5.3: 5000 meters * 1/5 = 10000 meters. Therefore, the distance Tyson needs to cover per day, training to run more meters per day, is 10000 * 1/5 = 2000 meters.
