For condition 1, we know that Sandra gets 9 eggs when she babysits. For condition 2, we know that 7819475 Spanish flans are needed. Since 7819475 = 7819475, we can answer this question. Since 7819475 Spanish flans are needed, we can use the formula: 7819475 = n * (9 * 7819475), where n is the number of times she babysits. We know from the first condition that 9 is needed.
