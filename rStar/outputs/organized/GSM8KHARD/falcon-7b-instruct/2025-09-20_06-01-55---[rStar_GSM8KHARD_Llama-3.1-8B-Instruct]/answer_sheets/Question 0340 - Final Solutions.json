Miss Maria has 9668743 basketball cards in 9668743 boxes. Let x be the number of basketball cards she has. Then she has 9668743 * x basketball cards. And she has 25 basketball cards per deck, so she has (x + 25) basketball cards. The answer is: (x + 25) * 9668743 = (x + 25) * 9668743 + 25 = (x + 25 + 25) * 9668743. Then she has (x + 25 + 25) baseball cards per box, which is (x + 25 + 25) * 9668743 = (x + 25 + 25 + 25) * 9668743 = (x + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25) * 9668743 = (x + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
