A farmer charges $20 per bag. If it costs $2 to transport each bag, then we can assume $20 x 2 = $40 for transportation. In total, $20 per bag * $2 per bag = $40. So the total cost for transport is $40. If we divide $40 by $20 per bag, we can find that the trader bought $2 x 40 = $80 in bags. We can call this the number of bags he bought from the farmer. If it costs $2 per bag to transport each bag, then he made a total profit of $1000 x $2 per bag = $2000 for transportation. Therefore, the trader bought $1000 x $2 per bag = $2000 worth of bags.
