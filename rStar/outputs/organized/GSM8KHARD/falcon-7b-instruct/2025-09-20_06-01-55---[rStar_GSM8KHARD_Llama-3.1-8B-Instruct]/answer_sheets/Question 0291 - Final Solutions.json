Question: How many inches of ribbon can Monica use to make a bow for each gift?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Monica has 144 inches of ribbon. So she has 144 * 4 = 576 inches of ribbon. If she uses 3 inches of ribbon for each gift, then she will have 576 * 3 = 1926 inches of ribbon in total. If she wants to make bows for each gift, she will have 1926 * 4 = 7924 inches of ribbon in total. So she will have 7924 * 2 = 15848 inches of ribbon in total. If she uses 1 inch of ribbon for each gift, then she will have 7924 * 6 = 57782 inches of ribbon in total. If she wants to make bows for each gift, she will have 57782 * 2 = 115944 inches of ribbon in total.
