This means that if f and g represent the number of flights to France and Germany respectively, then f = g. Since these numbers are equal, they can be found using the fact that the total number of remaining journeys should be half of what the first plane does on average.

We know that during any given day, three quarters of the first plane's time is spent flying to Greece (i.e., it makes approximately 3/4 = 375% of its total flight time to Greece). Therefore, the remaining time is spent on other journeys, which include both flights to France and Germany.

Since the first plane doesn't go only to France (condition 3), but also shares equal journeys with Germany, let's say it makes x journeys to France and y journeys to Germany. Therefore, since the second plane solely travels to Poland and doesn't match the frequency or duration of the first plane's trips (condition 4), the total number of flights made by both planes cannot be equal. That means, the number of journeys made by the first plane must be greater than the number of journeys made by the second plane. Since the first plane makes three-quarters of its time flying to Greece (condition 2) and shares journeys between France and Germany (condition 3), the equation can be written as: 3/4 * time_flying_to_greece + x * flight_duration_france + y * flight_duration_germany = total_time_spent_flying. Using this, we can calculate the number of journeys to France by the first plane when other information is given.

During the rest of the day, it spends r% of its time on flights to France and the remaining (1 - r) % of its time on flights to Germany. In terms of total flight time, this means that F/(F + G) of the time is spent flying to France, and (F + G)/(F + G) is spent flying to Germany. Now, let's figure out how long the first plane spends on all its non-Greece flights to France and Germany together in one day. Since f and g are the same, the time spent on all non-Greece flights to France and Germany together is f * ((f + g)/(f + g)) + g * ((f + g)/(f + g)), which is equivalent to F * ((F + G)/(F + G)). The percentage of time spent on these flights is therefore F * ((F + G)/(F + G))/(F + G), which is equivalent to (F + G)/(F + G). Let's find out how long the first plane spends flying to France specifically in one day. This would be F * (F/(F + G))/(F + G). Comparing this to the calculation from part 1, we get F * (F/(F + G))/(F + G) = F * r/(F + G). Solving for F, we obtain F = Fr / r. However, since F is defined to be the number of flights to France, it cannot depend on the number of flights to Germany, which is represented by G (and hence Fr). Therefore, the expression F = Fr / r is meaningless. This implies that r = 0, meaning that the first plane does not fly to France at all. This contradicts the statement that \"the remaining journeys are shared equally between France and Germany\", which indicates that the first plane flies to both France and Germany. Hence our assumption that the number of flights to France is F leads to a contradiction, implying that there is no solution for F. Therefore, the statement that \"despite traveling less frequently, the second plane's daily itinerary accounts for just under half as many flights as the first plane\" is impossible to satisfy, and so we cannot determine how many flights the first plane makes to France in one day.
