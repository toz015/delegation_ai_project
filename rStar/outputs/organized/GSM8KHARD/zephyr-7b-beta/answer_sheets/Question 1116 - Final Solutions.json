So we need to calculate how much money Jim loses over the course of the time it takes him to pay off his loans, including interest. At the end of year one, Jim owes the government $50,000, but he has already invested this money for one year at 4%. At the end of year two, Jim owes the government $50,000 + $50,000(1 + .04) = $52,000, and so on. Let's call the amount of money Jim has lost in this time period X.
