Let's say the movie is 120 minutes long (that's 2 hours). That is equivalent to 7200 seconds. Since we don't have information about whether or not the tickets come with the whole movie or just part of it, let's assume that both options provide access to the whole movie. We want to find out which option costs less. The first option (super ticket) costs $20 for the movie ticket plus $1 for the popcorn and soda. That's a total cost of $21. With the second option, we pay $12 for the movie ticket and then we spend $5687521 on the popcorn and soda because that is what we get for free in the first option. The total cost is therefore $12 + 5687521 = $5688643. Comparing these two numbers, we see that the super ticket is cheaper. Therefore, we can be sure that both options give us the entire movie, including the time spent watching ads and trailers beforehand. So both options take exactly the same amount of time: 72", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
