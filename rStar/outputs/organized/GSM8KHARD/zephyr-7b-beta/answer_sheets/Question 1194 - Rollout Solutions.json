At the beginning, Maria didn't know exactly how much charge was left. But we do know that once at the park, 5 hours later, the battery still had 28% of its capacity. Let's assume that when Maria disconnected it, it had 100% (i.e., fully charged). During the first 5 hours, it lost 9% of its capacity each hour, so that is 0.09 * 100 = 9 percentage points. 9 percentage points would correspond to how many percentages left? Let's calculate this:\n\n(100 - 9) / 100 = 0.91\n\nSo 91% of the original capacity remains, which corresponds to a loss of 9 percentage points out of 100. To convert percentage points into actual units of charge, let's say that the power bank can hold 10000 mAh (milliampere-hours), which means that one percentage point corresponds to 100 milliampere-hours.
