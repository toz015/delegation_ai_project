Over 8 weeks, josh worked out for 4 hours almost all the time. This means 4 hours times 8 weeks is about the total amount of time he spent working out. Let's say it is exactly 32 hours (4 hours per week for 8 weeks). But we know that josh also spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, so that was 10 hours extra. We also know that once josh spent 6 hours. That adds up to another 6 hours. So in total, we have 32 + 10 + 6 = 48 hours. Since the duration is in terms of whole weeks, we need to round down to the nearest integer since 4 hours may not fill up a whole week. 48/4 = 12. So josh worked out exactly 4 hours for 12 weeks. The answer is: 12.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many weeks did Josh work out for exactly 5 hours?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that for 8 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours per week. That's a total of 32 hours. When Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks, it was for a total of 10 hours. During those two weeks, we can subtract the regular 8 weeks of 4 hour workouts which would leave us with 48 hours (10 minus 38) left over during those weeks. This means that for the other 6 weeks, Josh spent less than 5 hours a week working out. To find how many weeks out of those 6 weeks that Josh worked out for exactly 5 hours, we need to calculate how many hours josh worked out during these remaining 6 weeks. So there were 6 weeks, and we already know how many hours he worked out during the first 8 weeks and during the 2 consecutive weeks when he worked out for 5 hours. If we let josh's average weekly hours during these remaining 6 weeks be x, then we can say that there are 6 x and 48 total hours of exercise during these weeks. Since we know this, we can set up our equation like", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "The answer is 42."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
