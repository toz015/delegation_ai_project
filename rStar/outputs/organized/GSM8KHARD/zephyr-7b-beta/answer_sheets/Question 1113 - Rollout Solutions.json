That makes a total of 14805817 packs needed, which is equal to the number of students times the number of glue sticks per pack: 14805817 = 14805817 * 8. We can solve for the unknown variable by dividing both sides by 14805817. The answer is 8.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Each student needs exactly one pack (which contains 8 glue sticks), so Mr. Jackson needs a total of 14805817 packs. To find out how many packs that is, we can set up an equation: 14805817 = packs * 14805817 * 8, because there are packs, each containing 8 glue sticks, and each student gets one pack. Solving this equation for packs, we see that packs = 14805817 / (14805817 * 8) = 1. This means that Mr. Jackson needs approximately 1 pack for every student, or about 14805817 packs in total. However, since we can only buy entire packs, we might need slightly more than this, depending on the exact number of students. Based on our calculations, it seems like Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over, but to know exactly how many, we would need to calculate how many extra glue sticks there are when we round up to buying entire packs", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
