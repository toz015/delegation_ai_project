To get the distance traveled by Jeremy in one month, we multiply the average distance traveled per month (400) by 30 (number of days in a month). This gives us 12,000 miles. Now, using condition 1, the number of rotations would be 12,000 divided by 2 (since we are only considering miles per rotation), multiplied by 6091587 rotations per 2 miles. This gives us 36,452,370 rotations for one month's travel. Since each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations, we calculate the number of months before the tire needs replacement as follows: Number of rotations needed for one tire to wear out / number of rotations per month. 10,440,000 / 36,452,370 = approximately 290 months. This means the tire will need replacing after approximately 24 years and 2 months of driving based on Jeremy's monthly mileage.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
