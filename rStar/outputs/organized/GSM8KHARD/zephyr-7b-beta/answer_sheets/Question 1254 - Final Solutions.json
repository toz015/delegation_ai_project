If we add the number of red roses that Fred delivered and the number of red roses that Sandra still has, we get the total number of red roses that Fred needs to deliver by 5 pm.

Therefore, we don't need to consider how many pink calla lilies she ordered since those weren't affected by the incomplete delivery.
