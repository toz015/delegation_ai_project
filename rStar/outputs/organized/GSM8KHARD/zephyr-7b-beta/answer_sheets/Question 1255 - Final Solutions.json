The price of a foot-long fish sub is $1820758. The cost for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times as expensive as this. This means that we first find out how much the cold-cut combo sub costs, and then multiply it by three. To find out how much the cold-cut combo sub costs, let's call it x. We know that $x$ is three times less than $1820758$. In other words, $x$ is $1820758/3$. $x = \\frac{1820758}{3}$ dollars. So the cost for one six-inch cold-cut combo sub is $\\frac{1820758}{3}$. If you buy both subs today, you will have spent $\\frac{1820758}{3} + 1820758$ dollars.
