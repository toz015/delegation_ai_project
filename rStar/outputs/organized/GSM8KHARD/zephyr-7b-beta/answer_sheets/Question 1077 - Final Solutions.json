We have four conditions. Let's call the initial number of children I. At the second street, we know every child has someone else, so twice as many people come, which means I times 2 equals children who come here. At the third street, we know each child has two newcomers, so twice I equals children who come here. So we can make an equation: I times 2 plus I times 2 equals the original amount less all the kids who left when they started pursuing the truck. Or: 2I equals (initial number of children) minus (initial number of children) times (percentage who left). That simplifies to: I equals half the initial number of children multiplied by the percentage who remained. This percentage is unknown, but our final condition tells us that when the truck starts moving again, nobody from the initial group remains. So: the number of children remaining behind the truck as it continues its route is zero.
