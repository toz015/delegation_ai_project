Solving this equation, we get x = 22. So each box has 22 pencils. Using this information, we can determine how many pencils Jam has, using both conditions. 22 times 3 boxes is 66 pencils, and Jam also has the two loose pencils. So Jam's total number of pencils is 66 + 2, which is 68. Alternatively, we could use condition 2 to solve directly for Jam's number of pencils, since we know Meg's number.
