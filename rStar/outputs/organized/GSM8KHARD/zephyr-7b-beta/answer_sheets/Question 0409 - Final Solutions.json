Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, let's find out how much she weighs before finding out how much Bob weighs. First, we write down that Susan's weight (S) is less than Mark's weight (M). S - 20 = M - 150. Next, we calculate the weight of Bob (B) which is twice as much as Susan's weight. B = 2S. Substitute S from the equation above into B to get B = 2(M - 150). Rearranging, M = 3/2*B + 150. Since we already know M, we can substitute it into this equation and solve for B. Using our knowledge that M = 150 and S = M - 20, we get S = 150 - 20 = 130.
