Therefore, the total time taken to dig all the large holes would be 15 large holes X time taken to dig one large hole. That comes to 15 * 0.167 hours = 2.5 hours.

Now, let's find out how many hours it will take to dig all the large holes. Let's assume x hours are required to dig all 15 large holes.

In x hours, Matthew could dig 15 * 600 seconds per hour = 9000 seconds worth of large holes. Since we know that it took us 140542.5 hours to dig all the small holes, adding up both large and small hole digging hours will give us the total hours needed.

To find out how many small holes can be dug in an hour, we divide the number of small holes by the time it takes to dig them. So we need to know how many small holes can be dug in an hour. Let's call this number `x`. Then,\n\n`x` small holes can be dug in 1 hour. Each small hole takes 0.05 hours to dig.\n\nSo we can set up this equation:\n\n```text\nx * 0.05 = 1\n```\n\nSolving for `x`, we get:\n\n`x = 1 / 0.05` hours\n\nNow let's find out how many small holes Matthew can dig in an hour. Since we found out that 1 hour equals `x` small holes, we can multiply the number of small holes Matthew wants to dig by the ratio of small holes to large holes.
