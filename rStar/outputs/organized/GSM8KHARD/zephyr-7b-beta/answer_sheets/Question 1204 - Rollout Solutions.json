We'll call that number z. So, after the first 12 hours, there are returning_bees = y + z bees. So now, we have two equations to determine the variables: returning_bees = x/4 + y and returning_bees = y + z. Setting these equal and solving for y (we're not too interested in z), we get y = (4/3)*(returning_bees) - x/12.

Debra saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours. When she saw 1/2 as many returning (or half the number that left), that was another 15 bees. That makes a total of 45 bees. But when she saw two times as many leaving again over the next 6 hours, that was twice as many as the original 30. So that was 60 bees. And finally, all the remaining bees from the original 30 came back. So those 30 bees make a total of 95 bees that left during the first 6 hours.

At first Debra saw 30 bees leave within the first 6 hours. She saw half that many, or 15, return during the next 6 hours. This brings us up to 45 bees. Debra then sees twice as many bees as she saw leave during the next 6 hours. Since we know how many left, we can find out how many returned: Debra saw twice as many bees leave as she saw in the first 6 hours (meaning, if the number of bees that left was x, then there were 2x bees that left during the third 6 hour interval). We also know that there were the same number of bees that left and returned during this time period (because Debra saw no new bees during this time). So we can set these numbers equal: 2x = x + 30. Solving for x, we get that x = 30. So Debra saw 30 bees return in the last 6 hours. This makes a total of 45 + 30 = 75 bees returned in the first 12 hours.
