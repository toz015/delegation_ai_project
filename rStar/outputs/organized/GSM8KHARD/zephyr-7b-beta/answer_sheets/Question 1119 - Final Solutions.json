This number is also equal to 1/1948832 of his total number of weekend minutes, so let's find out how many weekend minutes he has. John studies for 1/1948832 of his weekend minutes each day (Saturday or Sunday), so let's write an equation involving these variables: x = John's number of weekend minutes; y = number of extra weekend minutes; z = number of minutes John studies on the weekend (x - y); w = total number of weekend minutes in a week (2 * 168); q = number of minutes John studies during the week (800); r = total number of minutes John studies in a week (q + z). Then we get: z = x/1948832; z = (x - y)/2; z = (x - y)/(2 * 168); q + r = w; 800 + z = 2 * 168 * (y/w + x/w); 800 = 2 * 168 * ((y/w) + (x/w) - z/w); 800 = 2 * 168 * (1 - z/w) + (y/w) * 2 * 168; The equation above gives us the value of y in terms of x, w, and z: y = (800 * w - 2 * 168 * (1 - z/w))/(2 * 168); Plugging in values for w, z, and x leads to: y = (800 * 2 * 168 - 2 * 168 * (1 - 24))/(2 * 168); This simplifies to: y = 672; So, John spends 672 additional minutes studying on weekends.
