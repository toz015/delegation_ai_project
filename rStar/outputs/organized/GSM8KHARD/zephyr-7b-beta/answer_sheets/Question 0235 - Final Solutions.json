The volume of a rectangular prism is the product of its length, width, and height. So we have volume = length * width * height = 6 ft * 4 ft * 5 ft = 120 cubic feet. Since it costs $0.1 per cubic foot, we can find the total cost by multiplying the volume by $0.1 per cubic foot. Let's write out the calculations as follows:\ntotal_cost = (volume in cubic feet) * ($0.1 per cubic foot)\ntotal_cost = (120 cubic feet) * ($0.1 per cubic foot)\ntotal_cost = $12.00\nThe answer is: $12.00.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

We're given that John's rectangular pool measures 6 feet by 4 feet and has a depth of 5 feet.
