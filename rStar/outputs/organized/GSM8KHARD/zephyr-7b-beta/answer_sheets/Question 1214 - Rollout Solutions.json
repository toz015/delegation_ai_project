The answer is: 3500 calories per pound times 7547401 pounds is 2685951000 calories. Divide this by the number of days it takes him to lose those pounds, which is approximately 344 days.

In other words, the number of days is not a multiple of 365. Hence, leap year(s) should be skipped. However, let's check it anyway:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "Is this year a leap year?", "subanswer": {"text": "The current year is 2022. Divide the number of days from Feb 1st to Mar 1st by 365:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "5": {"subquestion": "How many days are there from Feb 1st to Mar 1st in the current year?", "subanswer": {"text": "59 + 28 + (current year % 4 == 0 && (current year % 100 != 0 || current year % 400 == 0)) * 1 = 89 days. The condition checks whether the year is divisible by 4. If it is, then check whether it is also divisible by 100. If not, then it's a leap year. Otherwise, if it's divisible by 400, then it's still a leap year. Otherwise, it's not a leap year. Now that we know the number of days, we can compare with 365:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
