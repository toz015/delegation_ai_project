Therefore, S is equal to U plus 2. So, it becomes U + 2.\n\nNow, let's calculate everyone's age and sum them up. B is the oldest, so his age comes first. It's equal to U plus 3. Therefore, B's age is U + 3. S is next, so her age is U plus 2. Finally, yours is the youngest, so you come last. You're age is U. Adding everything together, we have:\n\n(U + 3) + (U + 2) + U = B + S + U\n\nNow, use algebra to solve for U.

Here's the system with four variables: {x, y, z, m}. Now let's eliminate 'x' from this system. Since 'x' is the age of your sister, you can replace 'x' everywhere by 'y' - 3, because you said your sister is 'y' - 3 years younger than you. Eliminating 'x' from the first equation (m = 3z - 1) yields: {m = 3(z - (y - 3)) - 1}, and eliminating 'x' from the second equation (x + y + z + m = 7765611) yields: {y - 3 + y + z + m = 7765611}. Substituting 'm' from the first equation into the second equation results in: {y + z = 7765638}. Now substitute 'z' from this new equation into the first equation: {m = 3(z - (y - 3)) - 1 = 3(y - 6) - 1}.

This means that 'z' is equal to 'm' plus one year minus three times your brother's age ('z'). In other words, 'z' equals 'm' plus one year minus three times your brother's age ('z'), which is 'm' plus one year minus three times the age of 'x', which is 'y' minus 3.
