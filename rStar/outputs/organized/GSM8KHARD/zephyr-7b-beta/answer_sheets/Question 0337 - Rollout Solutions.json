Let us call Toni's amount of plants X. Based on the second condition, we know that there are some number, Y, of plants belonging to Frederick that represents a greater percentage of plants than what Toni has. That is, X represents less than Y% of all the plants. We convert both X and Y to plant units (let's call them XU and YU respectively) and calculate the ratio XU/YU based on this percentage.
