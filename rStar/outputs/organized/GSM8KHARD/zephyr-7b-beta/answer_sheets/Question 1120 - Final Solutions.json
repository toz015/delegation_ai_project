To find the area, we need to multiply length times width. First let's calculate the areas of the north and south walls. 10 * 8 = 80 square feet for both. Now let's find the area of the east wall, which is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. And finally, let's calculate the area of the west wall, also 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Adding them together gives us the total square footage: 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 200 square feet. Now let's find out how many gallons are needed. Divide the total square feet by the number of square feet per gallon: 200 / 20 = 10 gallons. This means that it will take 10 gallons of paint to cover the entire room.
