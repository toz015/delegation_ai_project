First let's find how many women there were when there were 358474 passengers. Using the formula we learned earlier, (women) = (men) * (9/5). Swapping the variables around, (men) = (women) * (5/9). So (men) = (358474 * 5)/9. Simplify this expression to find how many men there were. (men) = 254867.556 men.\n\nNow we know how many men were on the bus before the women left. When 20 women leave, the number of women remaining is just the original number of women minus 20: (women remaining) = (original number of women) - 20. We also know that the ratio is still 5:9. Therefore, we can again use our formula to find how many men are remaining on the bus: (men remaining) = (women remaining) * (5/9).
