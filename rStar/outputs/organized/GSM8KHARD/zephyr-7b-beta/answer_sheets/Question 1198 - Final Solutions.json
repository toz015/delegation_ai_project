Four of the workers worked for 10 hours each, so they produced a total of:\n\n(Two fast workers) * 2 * 10 = 4096000 toys\n(Two slow workers) * 2 * 4 = 12800 toys\nTotal toys produced = 4096000 + 12800 = 4224000 toys\n\nNow, we know that there are still 20 toys needed to fulfill the order. Therefore, the fifth worker needs to produce those remaining 20 toys during his/her shift:\n\nLet x be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. Since the fifth worker also works for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker is x * 10. We want this number to equal 20, because there are still 20 toys left to fulfill the order.

Let's use what we found in hint 1. The first two workers produce 2572250 toys per hour. So far, they have produced 5144500 toys since the beginning of the project. The other three workers also produced 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour. So they produced a total of 8 * 10 * 5 = 400 toys during their shifts.
