That comes out to be approximately 7.14 pounds per day. Let's call this number x. Since sarah's brother weighs 65 pounds at birth and gains 75 pounds later on, we can say that sarah's brother's weight (in pounds) is 65 + x. David's brother weighs 70 pounds. Similar to above, we can write down an equation relating sarah's and david's brother's weights: 70 = 65 + y. Since sarah does 4 times as much laundry as david and raymond does half as much laundry as sarah, sarah does 9 times as much laundry as raymond. Let's write down equations relating their brothers' weights and their daily amounts of laundry: x = 7.14, y = 6.25, and 0.5x = z, where z represents raymond's brother's weight in pounds.
