That's written as: Bobby's original number of video games = 3 * X - 5. When comparing, this changed to: Bobby's current number of video games = 3 * (X - 5) - 5. So, combining the two equations:\n\nBefore comparing: 3 * X - 5 = Bobby's original number of video games. Comparing: 3 * (X - 5) - 5 = Bobby's current number of video games. Subtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n0 = 3 * (-5) - 15, or -30 = 5 * (-6). But we know that -30 can't be equal to 5 * (-6), since those numbers are too different in size. So our assumptions must be wrong somewhere. Based on the hint above, it looks like we made a mistake when we wrote: Bobby's original number of video games = 3 * X - 5.
