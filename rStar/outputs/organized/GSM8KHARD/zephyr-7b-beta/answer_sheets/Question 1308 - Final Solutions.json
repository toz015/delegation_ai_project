We know that 3916517 guests need hot dogs. Half of them would get 2 hot dogs each. That means there would be 2 hot dogs for every one guest.

However, forty additional guests each received a second hot dog, meaning we also have to account for these additional hot dogs. Using this information, we can find out how many hot dogs were consumed:\n\nNumber of hot dogs consumed = Number of guests who received only one hot dog * Number of hot dogs each received + Number of guests who received a second hot dog * Number of hot dogs each received\n                                       = (3916517 - 40) * 1 hot dog per guest + 40 guests * 2 hot dogs per guest\n\nTo simplify calculations, we round up the number of guests who received only one hot dog since we subtracted forty guests who received seconds from the original number of guests.
