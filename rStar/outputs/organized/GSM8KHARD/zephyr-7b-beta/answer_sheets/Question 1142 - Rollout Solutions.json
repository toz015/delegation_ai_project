Firstly, Carla could normally download 99041200 GB/minute. Let's say it took her x minutes to download the first 40% of the file. That would mean she downloaded (0.4)(99041200)GB, or 396166400 GB. At 99041200 GB/minute, that's 396166400 / 99041200 minutes. So x minutes is:\n\nx minutes = (396166400 GB) / (99041200 GB/minute)\n\nAfter the restart, it takes another 99041200 minutes to install Windows updates. So in total, the whole process takes (x minutes) + 99041200 minutes. To find out how long it takes to download the entire file, subtract the time it takes to install Windows updates from the total time.\n\nSo let's call the time it takes to download the entire file y minutes.
