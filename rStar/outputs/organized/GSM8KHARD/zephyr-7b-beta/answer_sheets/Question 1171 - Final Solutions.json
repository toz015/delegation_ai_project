First we find out how many rotations occur for Jeremy's monthly driving habits. We know from condition 1 that for two miles traveled, the tires rotate 6091587 times.

Dividing the maximum number of rotations per tire (10,440,000) by the number of rotations per month (1.6 million) gives us about 6,469 months, or almost 541 years, until the tire needs replacement.
