Solving both equations gives us 18 hours for sightseeing (since 40% of the time is spent sightseeing), and 9 hours for everything else. The remaining time left over is 27 hours minus 18 hours for sightseeing, and 9 hours for all other activities, which gives us the time for boating and swimming combined:  27-18=9.
