Condition 1:  Jerry has a flock consisting of both red and white chickens. Condition 2: Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, while white chickens generate 1801110 eggs per day. Condition 3: Every day, Jerry gathers 42 eggs, regardless of color. Condition 4: There are more white chickens than red chickens, and the difference is exactly 2. Question: Based on this information, how many red chickens does Jerry currently possess?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how many red chickens Jerry currently possesses, we first need to find the exact number of white chickens. We know that there are more white chickens than red chickens, and the difference is exactly 2. Let's call the number of white chickens W and the number of red chickens R. This leads to W > R and W - R = 2. Using these conditions, we can create two equations and solve them simultaneously.\n\nEquation 1: Number of Eggs Produced Per Day = Total Number Of Chickens * Average Number Of Eggs Per Chicken Per Day\nRed chickens: R * 3 = Number of Red Chickens' Eggs\nWhite chickens: W * 1801110 = Number of White Chickens' Eggs\nTotal number of eggs produced per day = Number of Red Chickens' Eggs + Number of White Chickens' Eggs\n\nEquation 2: Number of Gathered Eggs Per Day = Number of Eggs Produced Per Day\n42 = (R * 3) + (W * 1801110", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
