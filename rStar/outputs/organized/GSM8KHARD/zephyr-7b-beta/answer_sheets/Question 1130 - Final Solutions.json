If the profit is 25%, then we can calculate it as follows: Profit = 0.25 x Original Price. If the original price was O, then the profit would be P = 0.25 x O. But we know both the profit and the original price. That means we can set up an equation: P = 0.25 x O. Since the vendor made a profit of $1559990, and since the original price was $6199980, let's substitute these values into the equation: 1559990 = 0.25 x 6199980. Using division to solve for O: O = (1559990 / 0.25) = 6239992. Dividing this by 50 (since there were 50 watermelons) to get the price per watermelon: $6239992 / 50 = $12479984/10.

The fruit vendor paid $6199980 for 50 watermelons. Because he made a profit of 25%, we can find out how much he earned as a profit. The percentage of the profit is 25%. To convert percentage to decimal, divide the percentage by 100. 0.25 is 25% as a decimal. Adding this decimal to 1 gives us 1.25. So 1.25 times the amount spent ($6199980) is how much profit he made. 1.25 x $6199980 is $7799980. This is how much he earned in total. Now let's find out how many dollars each watermelon was sold for. The total amount he spent was $6199980. The total number of watermelons he sold is also 50.

First, let's calculate the selling price per watermelon. It costs 50 cents for each watermelon and there is a 25% profit margin. To calculate the profit percentage, we first find out what percentage the profit margin is of the original cost. Let's say it's x%, since we don't know the exact number yet. This means that if the watermelons sell for x dollars each, the profit would be (x/100) * 50 * x. Since we want to make a profit of 25%, this works out to (25/100) * 50 * x = x/4. Substituting, we get (25/100) * 50 * x = x. Solving for x, we get $100. So the selling price per watermelon is $100. Next, let's figure out how much the fruit vendor spent on all the watermelons.
