If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many seashells were brought by each boy?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. 2680935 students went on the school trip. They were split equally into boys and girls. Let's say there were x boys. So x/2 = 1340467.5. To find the number of shells each boy brought back, we divide the number of shells found by the number of boys. That means 60 * x = 1340467.5. We can set up the equation as: x = (1340467.5)/60. This is an example of solving a system of linear equations using substitution method. When you plug this value of x in the first equation, it should equal the original number of students. Rounding off the solution x to the nearest integer, we get x = 223411. Therefore, each boy brought back approximately 223411/2 = 111705.5 shells. But since we cannot have a decimal number of seashells, let's round it off to the nearest whole number. So each boy would have brought back approximately 111706 shell", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Each boy brought back approximately 111706 seashells. Now, let's think about the girls. We know that the number of seashells brought by the girls is equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's call the number of seashells brought back by each girl \"x\". Using this information, we can set up another equation: x = y + 4y, where y represents the number of seashells brought by each boy. When we substitute the value of y from our previous calculation, we get: x = 111706 + 4*111706. Solving this quadratic equation, we get the approximate value of x as x = 558530. Rounding off to the nearest whole number, we get that each girl brought back approximately 558531 seashells. The answer is: Each girl brought back approximately 558531 seashells.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
