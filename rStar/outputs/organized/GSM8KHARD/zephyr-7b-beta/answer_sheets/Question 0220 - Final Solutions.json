So the total distance that John drives each year is 50 * 60 = 3000 miles. Let's calculate the cost for miles driven first. John pays $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the amount John pays each year just for driving is $2 * 3000 = $6000. Then he also pays his driver a bonus of $150 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, John pays $150 * 12 = $1800 per year for the driver bonus. Therefore, we can add the cost for miles driven and the driver bonus together to find out how much John spends annually on transportation. $6000 + $1800 = $7800.
