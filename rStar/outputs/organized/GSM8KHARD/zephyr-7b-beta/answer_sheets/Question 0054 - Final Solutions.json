Each cellphone costs $268,305.60. Shiela paid this amount for all 5 cellphones, which came out to $1,341,528.00. To find out how much interest Shiela has to pay, we calculate the amount of interest based on the principal (initial amount) and the annual percentage rate (APR) divided by 12 (because there are 12 months in a year). The APR here is 2%, so the interest per month for one cellphone would be $268,305.60 * 0.02 / 12 = $406.95. Since Shiela is paying installments over 3 months, she will be paying this interest amount three times, once for each of her 5 cellphones. So the total interest Shiela will be paying would be $406.95 * 5 * 3 = $6,097.15.
