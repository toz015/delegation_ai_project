Next, we count the raspberries from the scattered fruit. We're told there are 67 scattered fruit, but we don't know exactly how many raspberries there are per fruit. Let's just call it x. 67 times x equals the total number of raspberries from the scattered fruit. 67x = ?. To find out how many raspberries are on each scattered fruit, divide both sides of the equation by 67. X = (?) / 67. Multiply both sides by 67 again. 67x = ?.
