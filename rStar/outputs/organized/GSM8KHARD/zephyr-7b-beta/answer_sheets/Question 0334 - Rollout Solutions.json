Another friend saw half as many as Katelyn did, which is 3/2 of what Katelyn saw (because \"half\" is just another way of saying \"three halves\"). The number of fairies seen by this friend is 3/2 of 6855673. Since we're looking for a fractional part of a large number, it may help to write this as 3 * (2/3) of 6855673. But since multiplying a number by a decimal is equivalent to dividing it by 1 divided by that decimal, we can also write this as 3 / (1 - 2/3) of 6855673.
