Since Jenny bought 2399001 roses, let's find out how many hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands we have when writing this number in standard form.

By counting the number of digits before the last one (which is 6), we see that there are 10 zeros before the last digit. So each time we count a zero, we divide by 10. There are 6 zeros before the last digit, so we divide by 10^6. Each time we count another zero, we divide by 10. So each individual zero counts as a power of 10.
