The company initially paid $4326221 for equipment. 40% of this was defective, so $4326221 * 0.4 = $1729488.40 was spent on defective items. This amount needs to be subtracted from the initial purchase price to find the cost of the functioning equipment. So the cost of functioning equipment would be $4326221 - $1729488.40 = $2596733.60.

Condition 2 states that 40% of these purchases are defective. We're going to find out how much the company has to spend on functional equipment. The amount of money spent on defective equipment can be found by multiplying the cost of all the equipment ($4326221) by the percentage of defective equipment (0.4).
