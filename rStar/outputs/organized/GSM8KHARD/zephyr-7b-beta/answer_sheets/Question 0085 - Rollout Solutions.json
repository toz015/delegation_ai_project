To find out how many fruits they brought in total, add up the number of fruits they brought separately. That means we need to find x, y, and the total number of fruits.

Based on what we know about Kael, we can say that he brought twice as many apples as Morrisette did. This becomes our first equation: x = 2 * 5.

Therefore, the total number of fruits he brought is x apples plus 0.5y oranges. That's why I said earlier that we can find x, y, and the total number of fruits at the same time. Anyway, back to answering the question... From what we found earlier, Kael brought x = 10 apples and 0.5y oranges. Using our second equation, we can get rid of the \"total fruits\" variable. That leads us to an expression involving x and y alone: 10 + y = x + y. Now we need to solve for x and y in terms of the other variable. To find expressions for x and y in terms of either x or y, let's get rid of y in terms of x using the fact that y is 200 times the difference between the numbers of oranges Kael and Morrisette brought. Since Kael brings half the number of oranges that Morrisette does, that means he brings 1/2 times 1994134 oranges. And since Morrisette brought x oranges, that means Kael brought 0.5x oranges. By definition of difference, the difference between these two numbers of oranges is their absolute value: their magnitude but sign ignored. Since Kael brought fewer oranges than Morrisette, the difference should be negative. We can write the difference in terms of y as y = -0.5x. To get rid of y in favor of x, substitute for y in terms of x in our second equation: 10 + (-0.5x) = x + (-0.5x). Simplify and combine like terms: 0.5x = -10. Solve for x: x = -200. However, this result doesn't make sense because Kael cannot bring a negative number of apples! So the solution we just found is not valid. The problem must have some inconsistency because we found a negative value when we shouldn't have done so. In other words, this system of linear equations has no solutions.
