After fulfilling the request, April would have 310596 minus the number of pots she provided to the school. To find out the number of pots she provided, we need to figure out how many she provided for the daisies and the roses.\n\nApril provided 30 pots for the daisies. For the roses, she provided twice as many, which is x. Adding those up: 30 for daisies plus x for roses equals the total number of pots requested by the school.\n\nWe can write this mathematically as follows: 30 (for daisies) + x (for roses) = 30 times 2 (for roses). Simplifying, we get: 30 + x = 60x. Solving for x, we get: x = 500.\n\nNow we can calculate how many pots April has left over.
