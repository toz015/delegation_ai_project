Question: How many times can each child be served leftover soup for lunch using the remaining portions in the pot?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many servings are there per pot of soup?", "subanswer": {"text": "Each pot provides enough servings for 4 adults or 8 children. There are four adults and eight children involved here, so each pot should contain enough servings for 4*4+8*8=32 people. Since one pot equals 32 servings, there are 32/serving servings per pot. The answer is 32.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "How many servings are still remaining in the pot after Calvin and his spouse eat their dinner portion? When Calvin and his spouse eat their dinner portion from the pot, each of them eats one serving, which leaves us with 32-(2*1)=30 servings remaining.\n\nHint 2: Let's say we call the number of leftover servings remaining in the pot as 'x'. Using the information provided, we can create equations to help solve the problem. One equation could look like this: 'x' is the number of times each child can be served from the remaining servings in the pot. Another equation could look like this: 'x' is equal to the number of servings left in the pot divided by the number of children. This equation looks like this: 'x' = 30 / NumberOfChildren.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
