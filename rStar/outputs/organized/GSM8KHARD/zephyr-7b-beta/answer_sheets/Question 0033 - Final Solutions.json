The answer is: $70,952.\n\nHint 2: Alternatively, to find Lloyd's earnings per week, we can multiply the number of eggs sold per week by the price per dozen. Number of eggs sold per week = (number of eggs sold per day) * (number of days per week). Since Lloyd sells all his eggs, the number of eggs sold per day is the same as the number of eggs produced per day (8634862). Therefore: (8634862 eggs per day) * 7 (days per week) = (number of eggs sold per week). Let's call the number of eggs sold per week X.
