We know that Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so 100 times the number of silver pesos that Axel has equals the number of silver pesos that Anna has. Let's call the number of silver pesos that Axel has s. Then Anna has 2s. To find the total number of silver pesos between Axel and Anna, we add their individual numbers: 50 + s + 2s = 150. Solve for s: 150 - 50 - 2s = s, or s = 50. So Axel has 50 silver pesos. Now we can calculate how many gold pesos Axel has: 8494515.
