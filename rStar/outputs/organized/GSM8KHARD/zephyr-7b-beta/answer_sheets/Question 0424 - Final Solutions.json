Judy bought 12 cups and 24 dishes (twice as many). That's a total of 36 items. Now let's look at her friend. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she brought. This is equivalent to her friend bringing 20 fewer dishes than twice the number of cups. Let y be the number of dishes her friend brought. Since her friend brought 20 fewer dishes than twice the number of cups, we can write this as: 2(her friend's number of cups) - 20 = y\n\nTo find her friend's number of cups, let z be that value. 40 is the number of cups her friend brought. So, her friend brought 40 cups, which is equivalent to 2z - 20 dishes. That means 40 = 2z - 20, so z = 20 + 2(40)/2 = 30.
