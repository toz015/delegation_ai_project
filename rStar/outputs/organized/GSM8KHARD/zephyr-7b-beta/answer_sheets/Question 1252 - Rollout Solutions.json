The equation for her total sales during the second year becomes y * 20$ + z * 0$. The final price of books in the second year is 0$, meaning that they didn't sell any books during the second year, leaving 50 unsold books. Hence, the equation for her sales in the second year is y * 20$. Now we substitute our values back into the second-year equation: 5715521 = y * 20$. Solve for y: y = 5715521 / 20$.

In the second year, she didn't sell any books because all books were sold before that. So there were initially 250 books, she sold 40x in the first year, and there are still 50 unsold books left now. So there were 250 - 40x - 50 = z books remaining at the end of the second year.\nIn the second year, she made 5715521$ in sales. Each book costs 20$. So y books were sold in the second year.

Elise's father had 250 books. She sold some each year. Let's say it was x, y and z books in the first, second and third year, respectively. So we can write:\n\nx + y + z = 250 (all the books were sold)\n\nIn the first year she sold twice as many as she does in the current year. We know she sold 5715521 in the current year, so let's call that y. The number of books she sold in the first year is therefore twice that, or 2y. So:\n\n2y + y + z = 250\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n3y + z = 250\n\nNow, let's look at the price. Each book sells for $20, so the total sales for one year is the number of books sold times twenty dollars. This is true for all three years, so let's write:\n\nx * 20 = 2x * 20 = y * 20\n\nThese equations have enough information to find y and z.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
