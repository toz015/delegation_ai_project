This tells us how old Darrell is today (y) in terms of Allen's age (x). Now we can write out Darrell's age 10 years from now (Darrell's age then is 7x + 10), which is also Allen's age today plus 10, because they will both be older by 10 years in 10 years time.

Let's say Darrell's age right now is D and Allen's age right now is A. From the first condition, we know that the ratio of their ages is 7:11, or D:A = 7:11.

This means that Darrell is currently 7/11 as old as Allen. Let's call Darrell's age d, and Allen's age a. We can set them up in a proportion: d/a=7/11. Cross multiply to solve for a: a = (d * 11)/7. 2) Their combined ages are 162 years old. Let's find darrell's age first: d = a * 7/11. Substitute this into the expression for their combined ages: a*(7/11) + a = 162. Solve for a: a = 11*72 = 804. This means that Darrell's age is d = a * 7/11 = 804 * 7/11 = 603. 3) To find Allen's age 10 years from now, let's use what we know about Allen's age, and Darrell's age plus", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 4}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
