In other words, the time span between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM should not be possible according to our model. This situation may indicate an error in the problem statement or the model itself. We could assume that the initial length of the candle is very large compared to the amount of wax that melts per unit time, but then we would be neglecting some crucial factors such as air currents, temperature fluctuations, etc., that could significantly affect the rate of melting.
