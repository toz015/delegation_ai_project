Therefore, Ram doesn't have any pens anymore after using this strategy. However, the question doesn't state whether the newly mixed functional pen is included in the 25 pens. In order words, we don't know if Ram still has the single functional pen he created from mixing the ink. Without further information, it's impossible to accurately answer this question. I would suggest consulting the person who gave you the conditions to clarify this detail. Until then, I would assume that Ram still has the single functional pen he created, since it wasn't specified otherwise. Therefore, the answer could potentially be 1 pen (the functional pen).
