The total number of items placed on the table is 16 Petri dishes plus y beakers. This is equal to the original number asked for by Dr. Grumpus, which was 8273687.

We know the requested amount was 8273687, so Igor gathered half of that, which is 8273687 / 2 = 4136843.5 test tubes. However, since Igor also gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, we need to take into account that two fewer Petri dishes (since he took two more than required) would be equivalent to 2 less from the requested amount. The requested amount for Petri dishes wasn't specified, but let's say it's x. Then the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered is x - 2. Now, since we know both the number of test tubes and Petri dishes, we can set these values equal to find out what value x has to take to satisfy our conditions. 4136843.5 = x - 2, so solving for x: x = 4136845.5.

Using the information that Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to collect 8273687 test tubes and 2x Petri dishes, we can write a system of linear equations using the variables test tubes (TT) and Petri dishes (PD).
