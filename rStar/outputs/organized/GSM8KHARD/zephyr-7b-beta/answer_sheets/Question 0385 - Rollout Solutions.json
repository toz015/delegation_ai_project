We also know that when everyone picks together, they collectively gather exactly 9370381 quarts of strawberries per hour. Substituting our expressions for the number of quarts picked by each child into this equation gives us:\n\n9370381 = 3x - 2. Solving for x gives us:\n\nx = 3123461. The answer is: 3123461.
