Since we want to know the cost per pair of contacts, let's first calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:\n\nPrice for one box: $111230\nDiscount (10%): $11123*0.9=$100110.7\nCost for 2 boxes: $100110.7*2=$200221.4\n\nTo get the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs. Each box contains 90 contacts, so in total, they have 180 contacts. Hence, the number of pairs is half of this, which is 90. Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:\n\nCost per pair: $200221.4/90=$2224.68$", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
