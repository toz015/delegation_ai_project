Now, since the sisters share equally (which means that the total amount they received as donations from Rissa and Ronnie is still 1/2 of what they initially had), we can find out how much they have left as follows: (Total amount Rissa initially had) - (Donation to their sister) - (Amount spent from their initial capital) = (Remaining amount).
