Judy teaches 8387270 dance classes a week during the weekdays, which is 5 times 1677414 classes a day. So this is equal to 5 * 1677414 = 8387270 classes in total. Adding the additional 8 classes on saturday makes it a grand total of 8387278 classes. Since each class has 18387270 students, we know that Judy has 8387278 * 18387270 students in total for the week. To get the price, we multiply the number of students by the price per student. So 8387278 * 18387270 = $1.56 trillion ($1,560,00,000,000).
