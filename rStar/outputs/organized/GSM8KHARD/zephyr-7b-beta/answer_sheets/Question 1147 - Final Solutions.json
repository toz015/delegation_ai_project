That means Karan will pay $182.50 in interest each month. Since she also needs to repay some of the principal each month, we don't yet know how much she has to pay back altogether. To figure this out, let's call the amount she repays per month P. Because she borrows $3,650, and she's going to repay it over 5 months, we can write out a system of equations like this:\n\nP + $182.50 = ($3,650 - P) * (1 + 0.01) ^ 5\n\nLet's look at the expression inside the parent", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%.

First we need to find the monthly interest rate. We divide the annual percentage rate (APR) by 12 since we have five months. 10% divided by 12 is 0.8333333333%.

This means that karan pays $30 in interest every month. Now we find out how much principle (amount borrowed) is paid off each month. Let's say it's x. Then the total payment every month would be: x + 30. To find out how much principle is paid off, we use the formula: Principal / [(1 + monthly interest rate)^number of payments - 1].
