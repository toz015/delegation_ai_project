So we can write: 3x = $15. Next, we know the price per apple is $1.3299286, and we want to find out how many apples Marie bought. Let's call this number y. So we can write: $1.3299286 * y = $5.3199132. Combining both equations and solving for x gives us: x = 5 (since $15 is divisible by 3). Substituting x into our equation for y gives us: $1.3299286 * y = $5.3199132, or simplifying: y = 4.

How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.3299286?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much did Marie spend on the chicken meal?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. The total amount Marie spent was $3299286. She spent $12 on the chicken meal, $15 on the milk ($3 per pack times 5 packs), and $5.3299286 (the price of 4 apples) on the apples. That leaves us with $3299286 - $12 - $15 - $5.3299286 = $313.35 on the boxes of pizza. Each box costs $8, so 313.35 divided by 8 is approximately 39 boxes of pizza. The answer is: 39 boxes of pizza. Next, we can find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal by finding what fraction of $3299286 it takes. The part we found earlier for the chicken meal, the pizza, and the apples takes up $12 + $15 + $5.3299286 = $32.3299286.

The remaining $3299286 - $32.3299286 is $3299253.68 on the pizza. Since each box costs $8.3299286, we need to find out how many boxes fit into $3299253.68 using our division skill. It works like this: $3299253.68 divided by $8.3299286 is roughly 39.638559835294 boxes. Since we cannot buy 0.638559835294 boxes, we round down to 39 boxes.
