We know that she collected one shell every month during those 5 years. That means she collected a total of 5 * 12 = 60 shells before age 10 (one per month for 5 years). Now, let's subtract the first 10 shells she collected before her tenth birthday. This gives us 60 - 10 = 50 shells remaining to find out how many months it took to collect them. We know that we collected one shell per month, so we can divide the remaining 50 shells by 1 to get how many months it took to collect them all. 50 / 1 = 50. Since we can't have fractions or decimals for our answer, we round up to the nearest whole number. 50 rounds up to 51, so that is our final answer.
