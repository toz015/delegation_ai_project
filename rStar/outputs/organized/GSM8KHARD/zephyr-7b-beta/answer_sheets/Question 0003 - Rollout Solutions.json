So altogether, Wendi fed her chickens 6887483 cups in the morning, plus another 25 cups in the afternoon. That brings us to a grand total of 14411478 cups for the entire day, since we already calculated that it takes 180 cups to feed all the chickens their evening meals. The answer is: 14411478.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 6887483 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?", "ost_step": {"1": "Wendi feeds each chicken three cups of mixed chicken feed per day."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Wendi feeds 20 chickens, and each chicken gets 3 cups a day, so that is 60 cups a day per chicken. So in total, Wendi needs to feed 20 chickens, times 60 cups per chicken, or 1200 cups of feed. In the morning, she gave 6887483 cups. 6887483 - 1200000 is 5887483 cups left over. In the afternoon, Wendi used 25 cups. So there are now 5887458 cups left. She has to divide the remaining cups by the number of chickens left, and find out how many cups she needs to feed one chicken. That will tell us how many cups she needs to feed all twenty chickens. To divide by twenty, we just divide the remaining cups by twenty. We get 29,937,289 cups of feed needed for each chicken during dinner time. Multiply this by the number of chickens (20), and you have the number of cups needed to feed all the chickens", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
