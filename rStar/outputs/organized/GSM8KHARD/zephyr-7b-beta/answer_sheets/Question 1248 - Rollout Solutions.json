Let's assume this amount of time is x."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we know she slept from 10 pm (600) to when she woke up (usually at 6 am, or 600). This should be x hours. X hours equals x * 60 = 600 - 6 = 594 minutes.\n\nNow let's look at the time she slept while sleepwalking. It happened from 2:15 to 2:38 am. That's 2 hours and 23 minutes, or 123 minutes.\n\nLastly, we know she woke up earlier than usual by 5 minutes. We can assume this happens right after her usual wakeup time (6 am), so she wakes up at around 5:55 am that day. We can also say that she fell asleep at around 10:55 pm the night before, because she usually sleeps for 8 hours. This makes it so that she slept for x hours before falling asleep at midnight.\n\nWe don't know exactly what time she fell asleep during her sleepwalking episode, but we can estimate that she fell asleep sometime between 2:15", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
