At first, James pays $15 * 6725879 = $10088319 for all the CDs. With a discount of 40%, he actually pays 60% of this price, which is $10088319 * 0.6 = $6053001.50. Since he sells 5 of these CDs for $40 each, he earns $200. James has a total income (from buying and selling) of $6053001.50 - $200 = $5852801.50. Now, let's calculate the final amount that James has after spending this money. James spent $5852801.50. We'll call this X. This means X is equal to $5852801.50.
