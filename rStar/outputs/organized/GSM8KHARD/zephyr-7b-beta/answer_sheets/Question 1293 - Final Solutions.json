That would be 3 * length (the length is given as 3 yards) plus 2 * width (since we only know about one side). To convert yards to feet, remember that there are 3 feet in a yard. 3 * 36 inches per yard is approximately 108 inches (2.743 meters), or equivalently 3 * 3 * 12 inches per foot (which is 1 foot = 12 inches). So now it's time to add them all together! Perimeter = 3 * 36 inches/foot (to convert yards to feet) + 2 * 120 inches/foot (width) = 126 inches/foot (approximately 10.5 feet).
