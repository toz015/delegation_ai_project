First day, 10 holes. Second day, 13 more holes (for a total of 23). Third day, 8 more holes (for a total of 31). We know that there were 6956398 holes they fell into. This tells us that we can find the total number of holes dug by using the formula: Total Holes = Holes on First Day + Holes on Second Day + Holes on Third Day - Fallen Into Holes. Plugging in our values, we get: Total Holes = 10 + 23 + 31 - 6956398. However, we also know that by the end of the fourth day, there were four times as many holes as there were after the first day. Let's call the total number of holes dug on the fourth day 'x'. Using this information, we can create another equation: Four Times Holes on Fourth Day = Holes After First Day. We can substitute the total number of holes dug on the fourth day for 'x', and the total number of holes dug so far after the first day for what we found earlier.
