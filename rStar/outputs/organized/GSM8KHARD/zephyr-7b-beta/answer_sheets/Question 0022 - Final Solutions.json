The second person's estimation is x / 2 + 20. And the third person's estimation is 1.25x. Now we can calculate their average. To get the average, you add up the values and divide it by the number of values. Here we have three estimates so there are three values to add. Their average is (first person's estimation + second person's estimation + third person's estimation) / 3. Substituting the expressions for each estimation, we get:\n\n(9926805 + x/2 + 20 + 1.25x) / 3\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n(3 * 9926805 + x + 20) / 3\n\nWe can remove the common factor of 3 to make this simpler.\n\n(9926805 + x/3 + 20/3)\n\nSo the average estimation is", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
