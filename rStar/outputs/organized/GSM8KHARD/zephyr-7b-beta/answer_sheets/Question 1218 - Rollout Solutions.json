Then she bought a package and added that many. At work, she put one on each cup of coffee (220 cups). Let's call the number of post-it notes in the package X. We can calculate the number of post-it notes used up by putting one on each cup. 220 cups at 1 post-it note per cup would equal 220 post-it notes. After putting one on each cup, Candice had 6445434 - 220 = 6445214 post-it notes. That is how many post-it notes are remaining after everything else happened. Using this information, we can set up an equation to solve for X: 80 + X = 6445434 - 220 Since Candice had 80 post-it notes to start, and then she subtracted the number of post-it notes she used at work, the difference is how many post-it notes she had remaining after buying the package AND putting them on the cups of coffee.
