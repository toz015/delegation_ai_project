We can calculate this as follows:\n\nBryce and his two friends had 2/3 of their respective pizzas, so they consumed 2*(2/3) = 4/3 slices each. This amounts to 4 * 4/3 = 16 slices in total for both of them.\n\nThe other two friends each consumed 3/4 of their pizza, which comes to 3*(3/4) = 9 slices each.
