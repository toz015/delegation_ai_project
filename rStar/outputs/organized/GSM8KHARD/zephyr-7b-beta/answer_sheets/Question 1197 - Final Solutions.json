However, since Ellen initially shook some sodas, she left behind exactly one unshaken soda. Since Ellen's brother took two unshaken sodas, this means that originally Ellen had shaken at least one of the sodas he took. This means that there were fewer than 9 unshaken sodas left when Ellen's brother took his two sodas, leaving us with a paradox. Since the problem specifies that there are originally 12 sodas, all originally unshaken, we know that the original number of shaken sodas was between 0 and 12. Let's say there were x shaken sodas originally, where x is between 0 and 12. We also know that Ellen took exactly one unshaken soda, and her brother took one shaken soda and two unshaken sodas. Let's call the number of unshaken sodas Ellen's brother took y, where y is between 1 and 9. Then, the original number of unshaken sodas must be equal to 12 - x - y, where this number is between 1 and 11. From this, we see that there are a lot of possibilities, and we can't determine the exact number of shaken sodas. But this means that we don't have enough information to determine the probability that Ellen's friend chooses a shaken can.
