One dollar is equal to 100 cents. Therefore, the number of cents he saves per day is: (dollars saved per day) x 100. Using our formula above, this is: $4050127 x 100. This simplifies to 405012700 cents saved each day. The answer is 405012700.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many days will it take the child to save the remaining amount of money?", "subanswer": {"text": "First, we need to write down an expression for the remaining amount of money the child needs to save. This expression is: Remaining Amount = Initial Cost - Initial Savings - Total Saved. Using our formula for total cost, and substituting in our initial savings, this becomes: Remaining Amount = 14050127 - 400 - Total Saved. Next, we can write down an expression for the number of days it takes for the child to save the remaining amount. This expression is: Days = Remaining Amount divided by Daily Savings. Using the expression we found for the remaining amount, and substituting in our daily savings, this becomes: Days = (14050127 - 400 - Total Saved) divided by 405012700. Solving this equation for Total Saved, and then plugging it back into our expression for Remaining Amount, and finally into our expression for Days, results in: Days = [(14050127 - 400) / 4050127] x [Total Days Left / Daily Savings]. This simplifies to: Days = (14006127 / 4050127) x DaysLeft / 100. Using this formula, we substitute in DaysLeft from our question, and then solve for Days. Doing this, we get: Days = (14006127 / 4050127) x DaysLeft / 100. Finally, taking our result, and rounding to the nearest integer, we find the total number of days it will take the child to save up for the toy car.
