Can you find values for x and y that satisfy both equations? One strategy is called substitution, which involves solving one equation for one variable, and then plugging that expression back into the other equation. Here's how it works:\n\nFirst, let's solve the first equation for x:\n\nx = 2 * Sally Four's age\n\nNext, let's substitute this expression into the second equation:\n\ny = Sally Four's age + 3\n\ny = 2 * Sally Four's age + 3\n\nNow we have a single equation with just one unknown, y.

Since Sally Two is three years senior to Granny Red, we can write this as Sally Two's Age (in years) - Granny Red's Age (in years) = 3. Calling Sally Two's age X, and Granny Red's age Y, this becomes X - Y = 3. And since Granny Red's age is twice Sally Four's age, we can say Y = 2 * Sally Four's Age (in years). We also know that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is eight years old. Letting Sally Four's age be Z, this becomes Z = 8. Now, let's see if we can solve for Z. First, let's substitute Z into our equation for Sally Four's age, which we found earlier: X = 8. Next, let's substitute X and Y from our equations above into our equation for Granny Red's age: Y = 2 * Sally Four's Age (Z).

Adding the second equation to the first yields:\n\n3X = 6 * Z + 3\n\nNow, we have an expression for X in terms of Z, so let's substitute it back into the first equation:\n\nX = 2 * Z + 1\n\nSubstituting X back into the second equation, we get:\n\n2 * (2 * Z + 1) = 4 * Z + 2\n\nSimplifying the left side and solving for Z yields:\n\n4 * Z = 4 * Z + 2\n\nSubtracting 4 * Z from both sides, and solving for Z yields:\n\nZ = -1/4\n\nSince negative ages aren't meaningful, there's no solution to this problem.
