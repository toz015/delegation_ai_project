Next let's find out how many cookies her sister ate on Tuesday (which is the second day). We know that on the first day her sister ate 5 cookies, which corresponds to 1000 calories (since each cookie has 200 calories). On the second day, we're told that her sister ate 2508320 calories, but we don't know how many cookies. To find out, divide the number of calories by 200 to find the number of cookies: 2508320 / 200 = 125416 cookies. So on the second day, her sister ate 125416 cookies.

Since we know that her sister eats 5 cookies on Monday, which adds up to 10 cookies for both sisters on Monday, we can assume that her sister eats 10 cookies every day. Using this assumption, we can calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. Since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, Sue ate 2*10 = 20 cookies on Tuesday. Now that we know how many cookies each sister ate each day, let's calculate their total calorie consumption.
