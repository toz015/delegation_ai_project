If Juan and Carlos made $25 in profit, we can find out how many glasses they sold using this expression: Profit/glass price \u00d7 number of glasses sold = Total profits ($25). We know the price of a glass is $0.50. So we get: $25 / $0.50 = 50 \u00d7 number of glasses sold. It takes 20 glasses to make one gallon, so we can find out how many gallons they sold using: Number of glasses sold / 20 = Number of gallons sold. Now we can set up another equation connecting the cost of lemons and sugar to the number of gallons they sold. For each gallon they spend $2296144 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So: Cost of lemons = $2296144 per gallon \u00d7 number of gallons sold. Putting all these equations together, we get: $25 / $0.50 = 50 \u00d7 (number of gallons sold \u00d7 20).

Income comes from selling glasses, so the number of glasses sold is the same as the number of gallons sold multiplied by the number of glasses per gallon. Thus, income is 0.50 dollars per glass times the number of glasses sold, or 0.50 dollars per glass times the number of gallons sold times 20 glasses per gallon. Expenses come from making lemonade, so the number of gallons sold is the same as the number of gallons made. Since they made $25 in profit, their expenses are the sum of lemon and sugar expenses, and their income is the sum of glass sales revenues. So setting up an equation for the number of gallons sold is: $$ 0.50 \\cdot \\text{number of gallons} \\cdot 20 = 25 + (2296144 \\text{cents per gallon for lemons} + 2 \\text{dollars for sugar per gallon}) \\cdot \\text{number of gallons}$$ This simplifies to $$ \\text{number of gallons} = \\frac{25}{0.50} + \\frac{2296144}{0.50} \\text{cents per gallon for lemons} + 2 \\text{dollars for sugar per gallon}$$ The number of gallons must be an integer, but since it's being added to a large fraction this can't be used to narrow down the possibilities.
