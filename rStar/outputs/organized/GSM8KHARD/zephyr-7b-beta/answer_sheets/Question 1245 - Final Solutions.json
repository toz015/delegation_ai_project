Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide and there is 1.5 feet between each flower. Using the hints above, let's calculate the number of flowers that can be packed in this flower bed horizontally and vertically.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of flowers that fit horizontally. As each flower grows 12 inches wide and 1 inch equals 1 foot, exactly one flower fits horizontally in 1 foot. Thus, 111 feet of flower bed would hold roughly 111 flowers if there was no space between them. But we want to leave 1.5 feet between flowers. So the number of flowers that can fit horizontally is calculated as follows:\n\n111 feet / (1 foot per flower - 0.5 feet per space between flowers)\n\nSimplifying, it becomes:\n\n111 / (1 - 0.5)\n\nUsing cross-multiplication:\n\n111(1) = 1(111 - 555)\n\n111 = 111 -", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Multiply each plant's required space with the number of plants needed to get the total space needed, which would be 4718637 * 18 = 86436726. This tells us that Pat will need a space of approximately 86 million square feet. Divide this by 12 to find out how many feet are required, since each foot provides 12 inches of width for a plant.
