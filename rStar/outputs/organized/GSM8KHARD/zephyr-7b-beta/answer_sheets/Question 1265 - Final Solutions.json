But let's not stop here because we want to calculate the exact price per cup. So, based on condition 2, the total cost of purchasing all the cups is known. Therefore, let's use it to find out the price per cup. Using algebra, let the price per cup be X. We can set up an equation using condition 2: Total cost = number of cups x price per cup. Substitute the numbers we found earlier into the equation: 240X = total cost; since we know the total cost of purchasing all the cups, we substitute it into the equation: 240X = total cost. Divide both sides by 240: X = total cost / 240.
