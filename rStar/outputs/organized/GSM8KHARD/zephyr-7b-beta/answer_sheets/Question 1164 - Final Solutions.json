At first, Mike earned 64729600 points in 20 minutes. Then we enter condition 3. In this case, a 25% increase means multiplying by 1.25. So in the next 20 minutes, he earned 1.25 times more points than in the previous 20 minutes. This is equivalent to adding an extra 25% onto the point output formula we had before. Using that formula, in the first 20 minutes, he earned 64729600 / 1200 points per minute. 1200 * 20 = 24000 points in the first 20 minutes. After that, he earned an additional 25% of that, or 30000 points in the second 20 minutes. Altogether, he scored 24000 + 30000 = 54000 points in the first 40 minutes. Continuing our pattern, we can see that every subsequent 20 minutes yields twice as many points as the last one, since the percentage increase keeps", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
