Condition 2:  The distance between the first and second cities is 75 miles; between the second and third cities is 100 miles, and between the third and first cities is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two segments. Condition 3:  The train makes this trip three times each day. Condition 4:  The train requires servicing after traveling 18,000 miles. Question:  How many days elapse between consecutive service sessions for the train?", "ost_step": {"1": "The train travels among three cities."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's call the cities A, B, and C. When we talk about the distance between cities, it means the distance between one city and another city. Let's see what the conditions say:\n\nCondition 1: We know that there are 3 cities. Let's name them as A, B, and C.\nCondition 2: Here, they give us the distance between cities AB (75 miles) and BC (100 miles). But they also tell us that the distance between BC and AC is 50 miles less than the combined distance of AB and BC. Let's write this as BC - AC = AB + BC - 50.\nCondition 3: This tells us that the train takes this route 3 times per day.\nCondition 4: Here we know that the train needs to be serviced every 18,000 miles.\n\nNow let's try to figure out how many miles the whole trip is. We can find this by adding all the distances: AB + BC + CA. But notice that CA is the same as AB because the train goes around in circles. So we get: AB + BC + AB = 2AB + BC.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
