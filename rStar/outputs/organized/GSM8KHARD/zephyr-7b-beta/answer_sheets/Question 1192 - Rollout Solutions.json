Rounding down to the nearest integer, this means Cameron spent approximately 19 hours at the hotel.

We know that it costs 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay. That means it costs 83.33 pesos per hour during that time (1000 / 12). After the initial 12 hours, we can pay either 2586356 pesos for a full 24 hours, or pay per hour for the extra time. Let's calculate both options to find out which one saves Cameron more money. If Cameron paid for the full 24 hours, it would cost 2586356 pesos. If Cameron only pays for the first 12 hours plus any extra time at the rate of 70 pesos per hour, let's call that x. Then the cost would be 1000 + x (since that's just the initial 12 hours) and then it would cost 70 pesos for each hour after that up to the full 24 hours. So the formula is 1000 + x + 70(10-5), since Cameron arrives at 5pm and leaves at 10am. To", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
