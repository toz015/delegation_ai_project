So we count the total number of vacations and divide by the number of blocks per row. In total, Gene went on 7821771 vacations, and we calculated the number of vacations he went on during each year. Using the method described above, let's calculate how many blocks he got from those vacations. We do not need to include the vacations in the first two rows because they will already be included in their respective years. Starting with the third year, Gene collected a quilt block from that year's vacation. So let's call these blocks \"year blocks\". Let's use YB to represent the number of year blocks. Using the calculations from Question 5.3, we know that when he was 33, he had 613352 vacations - (33 * 399365) = 151270 vacations. Since every year block is also a quilt block, we subtract that many quilt blocks from the total number of quilt blocks he got during that year. The formula to calculate the number of year blocks is: YB = (Vacations during that year - Year Blocks during that year) / Number of Blocks per Row. Therefore, YB for year 33 is (151270 - (613352 - (33 * 399365))) / 11 = 12 quilt blocks. Let's apply the same calculation for all the other years. And finally, the total number of quilt blocks is obtained by summing up all the YB values: YB for year 23: (399365 - (23 * 399365)) / 11 = 36 quilt blocks. YB for year 24: (399366 - (24 * 399365)) / 11 = 37 quilt blocks. Continuing up to year 33: Total YB = 36 + 37 + ... + 12 = 268 quilt blocks.
