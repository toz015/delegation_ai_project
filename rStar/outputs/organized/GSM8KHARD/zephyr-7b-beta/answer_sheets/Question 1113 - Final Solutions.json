Let's call the number of extra packs left over x, and let's assume that there's still some glue sticks left over when we divide all the glue sticks among all the students. Then, we know that the number of glue sticks that are actually used up (i.e., not left over) is equal to the number of glue sticks distributed among the students (which is the same as the number of glue sticks in all those packs) minus the number of extra packs: 14805817 * 8 = 14805817 * 8 - x * 8. Using this equation, we find that the value of x needs to be negative, because it's smaller than the difference between the number of packed glue sticks and the number of glue sticks used up.
