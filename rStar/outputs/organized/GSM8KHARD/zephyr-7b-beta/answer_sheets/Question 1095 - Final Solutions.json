In their previous shopping trip, they spent $80. According to condition 1, they received $7686303 / 20 = x discounts for each $20 they spent. Let's call x discounts per dollar spent in the previous trip. In this trip, they spent $43, and utilized a coupon that removes double the amount of savings from the price. This means that their actual cost after using the coupon is: $43 - 2x(double savings) = $43 - 4x(original savings). The original savings can be found by dividing the discounts by the number of dollars spent: ($7686303 / 20) / x. Substituting this into the formula, we get: $43 - 4(7686303 / (20*x))$. Using condition 1 again, we know that they received $7686303$ in discounts for spending $80, which is equivalent to $80*7686303/20$.

The answer is 4.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "With hint 1, let's think step by step. First we find out how many discounts the customer received in their current shopping trip. Since they utilized a coupon that removes double the amount of savings from the price, they would get twice as many discounts as usual. Let's say the customer receives d discounts in their current shopping trip (we're not sure how many yet). Each discount is still worth $20, so their total discount is 2d*$20 = $40d. In addition, the customer received 4 discounts worth $20 each in their previous shopping trip. So the customer received a total of 4 + 2d discounts during both transactions. And each discount is worth $20. So the total value of all the discounts is (4 + 2d) * $20 = $80 + $40d. Let's find out how much the customer actually spent during this transaction.

They redeemed their accumulated rewards (which we don't know yet) and used a coupon that removes double the amount of savings from the price. This means that they saved twice the amount they would normally save, and these savings were removed from the price. To understand how this works, let's assume that their savings without the coupon would be X. With the coupon, they saved 2X instead. However, because the coupon removed those savings from the price, they actually only saved X. So, 2X was removed from the price, but X was still subtracted for actual savings.
