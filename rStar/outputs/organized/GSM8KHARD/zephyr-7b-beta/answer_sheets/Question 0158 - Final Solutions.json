We know that all four students together scored 251 points. Of those points, Naomi scored 1972193. Let's call the number of points Yuri scored 'y'.

All of this adds up to n + y + b + j = 251 points. Plugging in our equations for Yuri and Naomi, we get: n + 0.5n - 10 + b + j = 251. Solving for j, we get: j = 251 - n - b + 10/2. Since we want j as a whole number, if n or b is already even, we can round down in order to avoid adding 1/2 to the result. Otherwise, we should round up so that j is a whole number.

The rest of the players (Jojo, Brianna, and Yuri) share the remaining points. Let's call the number of points these players shared be 'x'. This means Naomi earns x more than the others combined. Substituting into our expression: Naomi earns 251 - x points. Since she scores exactly half of all points earned by everyone else, we find her halfway mark is (Brianna's points + Yuri's points)/2. Using what we know about Yuri, this halfway mark is 1972193/2 - 10, or 986051. Since Yuri's score is ten below this value, we can use this value to calculate Naomi's overall points.
