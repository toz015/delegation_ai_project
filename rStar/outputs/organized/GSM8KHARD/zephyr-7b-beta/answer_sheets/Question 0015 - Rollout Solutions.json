During this time, it melts by 2 cm per hour, making a total of 8 cm (as we found out in Question 5.1). This means that the remaining length of the candle will be its initial length minus the 8 cm that it has melted during this period. Let L be the initial length of the candle. Then the remaining length is given by R = L - 8, where R is the length that remains after the period from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Substituting L = 8 (which is the length that we found out in Question 5.1) in R, we find that R = 8 - 8 = 0. This implies that there is no remaining length after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, meaning that the candle gets completely melted during this time period. However, since we assumed that the initial length of the candle is greater than zero, this scenario cannot happen. In other words, the time span between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM should not be possible according to our model. This situation may indicate an error in the problem statement or the model itself. We could assume that the initial length of the candle is very large compared to the amount of wax that melts per unit time, but then we would be neglecting some crucial factors such as air currents, temperature fluctuations, etc., that could significantly affect the rate of melting.
