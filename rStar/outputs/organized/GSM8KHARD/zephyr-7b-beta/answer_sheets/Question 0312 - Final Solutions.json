Adding the transportation capability of the minivans, we know that they can fit 5387984 employees, but let's say we only need to transport some small portion of those employees, maybe like 1% or 10,000, whichever one comes first. If it were 1%, then we would be transporting 0.01 * 5387984 = 53879.84 employees. However, if it were 10,000 employees, that is a much smaller percentage, so we don't need all of those minivans. Let's assume that we're using just enough minivans to carry the remaining employees who couldn't fit in the larger buses, so 0 of them do not contribute any capacity. That would mean we'd use 0 minivans, and thus, we wouldn't have any leftover employees. But that's impossible since we've already determined that there's a total capacity of 420 employees from the bigger buses alone. Hence, our assumption that we wouldn't use any minivans doesn't work out, which contradicts the fact that the leftover employees would fit into zero minivans. Thus, the only possible conclusion is that we do have some leftover employees, and since we've already accounted for the larger buses and the smaller buses, it follows that the minivans will also contribute to carrying people. Using the same reasoning as before, suppose we want to use x minivans to transport the remaining employees. Then, x minivans can carry x * 5387984 employees. Since the larger buses and smaller buses can already hold 420 employees, the remainder would be 1000 - 420 = 580 employees, whom the x minivans would have to transport.
