Now, when we say that the number of returning bees is 1/2 the number of bees that left during the second 6 hours, we're saying that there were returning_bees = (x/2) * (1/2) = x/4 bees. So, we need to find x. We know that after the second 6 hours, there are some returning bees, but we don't yet know exactly how many. Let's call that number y. So the total number of returning bees during the second 6 hours is x/4 + y. We also know that after the first 12 hours, all the bees that left during the first 6 hours had to return. We'll call that number z. So, after the first 12 hours, there are returning_bees = y + z bees. So now, we have two equations to determine the variables: returning_bees = x/4 + y and returning_bees = y + z. Setting these equal and solving for y (we're not too interested in z), we get y = (4/3)*(returning_bees) - x/12. We plug this back into the expression for returning_bees in terms of x and y and solve: returning_bees = (4/3)*(returning_bees) - x/12 + x/4. Simplifying, we get returning_bees = (7/12)*x.
