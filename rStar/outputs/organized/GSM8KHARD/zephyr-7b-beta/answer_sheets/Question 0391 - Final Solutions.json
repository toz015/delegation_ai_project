Since three times fewer passengers got on than got off, the difference between those numbers is -6 (so if the number of passengers getting off at the second stop is y, then the number of passengers getting on would be y-6). Substituting this into our expression for the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we get: x - 21 + (-6) = x - 27.

After condition 2, at the second stop, there were 224285790 - 4857138 = 175734462 persons remaining. Of these, 21 left at condition 3. This leaves us with 175734462 - 21 = 175734441 persons remaining. At the second stop, three times fewer people boarded than disembarked. Let x be the number of people who boarded. Then, three times fewer means that we want three times less than x; or, 0.33x. We know that there were 21 who left. So, 0.33x + 21 = 175734441.
