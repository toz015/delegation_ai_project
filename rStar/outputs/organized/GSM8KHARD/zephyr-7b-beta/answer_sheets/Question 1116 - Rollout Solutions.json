Since we don't know how much Jim made annually before college, let's call that amount 'x'. Before college, Jim probably didn't borrow any money for schooling. So x would be what was left over after his expenses, such as food, rent, utilities etc. For simplicity's sake, let's assume that those expenses stayed constant throughout both periods (pre & post college). If that's true, then the only difference in Jim's budget is the loan payments. When Jim finishes college, the total amount he owes is $200,000. So every year he will pay back 1/4 of that (i.e., interest plus principle) or about $50,000 per year. This leaves him with the original amount he made annually before college minus $50,000.

Let's say Jim got paid $25,000 annually before college. During college, Jim's income decreased significantly, since he wasn't working. However, we know that Jim earned enough during college to triple his income (from $25,000 to $75,000) once he graduated. We also know that the additional income Jim gained from his degree took care of his loans and other costs associated with schooling. In fact, if you add up all these figures, it should be equal to the amount Jim spent on schooling. From here, we can use an equation to determine how much Jim lost annually while in college due to not working. Again, I'm assuming that Jim's expenses outside of tuition stayed relatively constant throughout both periods (pre & post college). So we know that the difference between his pre-college income and his post-college income is equal to the cost of tuition (which equals the amount of student loans he obtained) plus whatever interest he had to pay on those loans. Let's say Jim had to pay $200,000 for college. The first year, he would owe $50,000 in interest ($200,00 divided by 4). In the second year, he would owe $50,000 in interest and another $50,000 for tuition, making the total $100,000. This goes on until year 4 when he has finished paying off his tuition, but still has to pay interest on the remaining balance of $150,000 (after paying off the last year's tuition). Since we don't know exactly when Jim started earning money from his degree, let's assume it's the beginning of the fourth year (immediately after graduation). This gives us an extra $75,000 of income for year 4.

That means he had $50,000 less than triple his previous income, which is three times twenty-five thousand ($75,000). So the difference is $75,000 - $50,000 = $25,000. Since it took four years to get the degree, we need to subtract four years worth of foregone salary and add the difference to find out when the debt and lost income is paid off. 4 years worth of foregone salary is $100,000 (4*$25,000). So we have $100,000 - $100,000 in lost income, plus $100,000 in debt, or $0 in debt/losses, exactly when Jim finished his studies.

Jim's annual income increased by 50000 dollars due to his college degree. While he was in college, he lost income that could have been earned from working instead of going to school. This loss of income can be calculated as follows: let's say it took Jim x years to earn enough to pay off his student loans, and during those x years he couldn't work because he was studying. During that time, his old annual salary of 25000 dollars would have grown to 25000 * (x+4) = 100000 dollars (assuming a steady growth rate), which is equal to the amount of student loans he accumulated. Therefore, we get the equation 50000 * x = 100000, or x = 2. The answer is: 2.\n\nAlternate solution: Jim's original annual income was $25000.
