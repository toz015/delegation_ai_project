This means that he weighed 'x' - 10 = 'y' pounds at the end of the first month. Then in the second month, he lost another 10 pounds.

By the third month, his weight would have reduced to 'z' - 10 = 'w' pounds.\n\nSo 'w' pounds is Mark's final weight which we know is 70 pounds. So we need to go backwards from here. Substituting 'w' for 70 pounds and working back, we get 'z' = 'w' + 10 = 80 pounds, 'y' = 'z' + 10 = 90 pounds, and finally 'x' = 'y' + 10 = 100 pounds.\n\nIn other", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month.
