First, we'll find out how many pillowcases and towels there are per room. Since there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets, we can say the number of pillowcases is twice the number of sheets (let's call this variable 'x'). Therefore, we have 'x' sheets per room, which equals 9247888. Also, since there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets, there are 2*x=2x sheets. And there are also 'y' towels, which is twice as many as 'x' pillowcases. We can represent this mathematically by 'y' = 2*x. Solving these equations gives us 'x' = 4624375 sheets, and 'y' = 9247875 towels per room. With 80 rooms, we get: 80*4624375 sheets = 3702300000 sheets. 80*9247875 towels = 7400694000 towels.
