Let's start by finding the cost of one board after the price increase. Each board was originally worth $7066651, but with a 50% price increase, it becomes $7066651 * (1 + .5) = $1055003. Under condition 1, we know the original cost of one board was $7066651, so the new cost per board is $1055003. Under condition 2, we know that each board originally cost $16, so let's calculate the profit per board when selling under condition 3. We can find this by calculating the difference between the new sale price and the new cost per board. New sale price = old sale price + (old sale price * percentage price increase). Old sale price = original cost per board / (1 - original cost per board as a fraction). Original cost per board as a fraction = $16 / $1055003.
