That means that Brinley's average will be (89 + 92 + 100 + new_score) / 4. We want this to be higher than the old average by 10 points. So (89 + 92 + 100 + new_score) / 4 - 88.6 = 10. Doing some algebra, we can isolate `new_score`:\n```\n(89 + 9", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Since Brinley goes to math class with Mr. Bert, we know that our question concerns only tests administered by Mr. Bert, which is what condition 1 describes. We also know that we can exclude one score from the calculation of her overall average, according to condition 3.\n\nIn order to find out what score Brinley needs to get in the final test, we need to calculate her overall average, given that she already knows the results of the first five tests. According to condition 4, these results are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Let's assume that Brinley's final test result is x. Our problem becomes finding x such that the following equation is satisfied:\n\n(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / (5 + 1) = 89.30810\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\nx = (89.30810 - 312) * 6 / 1\n\nWe solve this equation and obtain:\n\nx =", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
