To find out how many cakes Rose bought on Monday, we can first figure out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday and Wednesday, because we know how many times greater the number of cakes was than the ones she bought on Monday. On Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many cakes as she did on Monday. We don't know how many cakes she bought on Monday, so let's call it x. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. If she bought y cakes on Tuesday, then Rose would have bought 5y cakes on Wednesday. So the total number of cakes Rose bought on Tuesday and Wednesday combined is y + 5y = 6y. We know the number of cakes Rose bought on those two days is equal to the number she bought on Monday (which we want to find) plus the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday (x). So x + y = 6665653.

Then on Tuesday, she bought 3 times that number. And on Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number she bought on Tuesday. So we can write the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday as 5 times the number she bought on Tuesday. We can also say that the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is equal to x divided by 3. Plugging this into our expression for Wednesday's cake purchases, we get: y = (5/3 * x/3) / 5 = x / 9. Notice that the cake purchase formula above can be rearranged to solve for x. Y = (x + 6665653) / 4, so we'll use that to calculate how many cakes Rose bought on Monday, and then figure out how many she bought overall after all three days.
