However, after Newton threw an apple at the tree, causing 4717640 more apples to fall, we don't know how many apples were already on the ground besides the two initial ones. But we do know that Newton picked up all those apples except for one.

By contrast, when Newton brought the remaining apples home to make a pie, he had picked up all of the falling apples, so there were none left on the ground. If there were no apples left on the ground when Newton brought the remaining apples home, then there must have been the same number of apples left on the ground after Newton picked up everything but one apple as there were after the first two apples fell. In other words, since there were 4717639 apples left on the ground after Newton picked up everything but one apple, and there were none left on the ground when Newton brought the remaining apples home, there must have been a difference of 4717639 apples between these two moments. If there were initially 2 apples on the ground, then the number of apples left on the ground after Newton picked up everything but one apple is 4717639 plus 2, or 4717641 apples.
