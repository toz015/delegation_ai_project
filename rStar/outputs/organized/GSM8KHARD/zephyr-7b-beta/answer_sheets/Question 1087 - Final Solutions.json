One foot is equal to 12 inches. Let's divide all the lengths we found by 12. Then the rolls are 1200 / 12 = 100 feet long. The croissants are 720 / 12 = 60 feet long. To find the length of the baguettes, we can't simply divide by 12 because we don't know how many inches are in a foot. So let's find out using Google search (or math). One foot is 12 inches or 3 feet (since 3*12=36) or 0.3048 feet (since 36 / 12 = 3.048). Since 2 * 5280 = 3 * 10936, we can see that one inch is roughly 0.083333 feet. So let's calculate the number of inches in two feet, then divide it by 12. The formula for converting from inches to feet is `inches / 12 = feet` so the formula for converting from inches to feet and inches is `(inches % 12) / 12 + floor(inches / 12)`. Here we have a number of inches with remainder when dividing by 12 (i.e., the inches modulo 12); we want to extract both the integer part (i.e., the whole numbers of feet) and the fractional part (i.e., the inches remaining when we round down to an integer number of feet).
