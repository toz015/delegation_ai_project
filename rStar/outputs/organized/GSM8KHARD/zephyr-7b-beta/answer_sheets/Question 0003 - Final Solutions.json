Since each of her 20 chickens receives 3 cups equally throughout the day, we can calculate how many cups each chicken received in the morning. Each chicken received 3/3 cups, which equals one cup. We know that Wendi has 20 chickens, and since each chicken received one cup, there were 20 cups of feed given to the chickens in the morning.\n\nIn the afternoon, Wendi provided another 25 cups of feed. Using the same calculations as we did for the morning, we can see that if Wendi still distributes food equally amongst the chickens, each chicken would receive (1 cup in the morning + 0.25 cups in the afternoon) = 1.25 cups in total. Since she still needs to distribute feed equally amongst the 20 chickens, she would give each chicken 1.25 / 3 = approximately 0.42 cups of feed during the evening meal.\n\nTo find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to provide during the evening meal, we can multiply the number", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
