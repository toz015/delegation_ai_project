That means the distance covered east was d - d = 0, so he didn't travel at all during these 8 hours. Therefore, Elvis covered only the distance traveled west, which we still need to determine. We can use the fact that he covered a total distance of 13 hours (5 + 8) and find the average speed. Average speed = total distance / total time, which is 13 hours. This gives us the equation d = 13 * average speed, where average speed is still unknown. To solve this, we need to know the speeds traveled west and east.

Overall distance = distance traveled west + 0 (since he didn't travel any distance while traveling east). Step 6: Substitute the distance traveled west into our equation for average speed to get: Average speed = Total distance / Total time = (Distance traveled west) / (5 + 8) = (d) / (13). Step 7: Next, let's substitute the expressions for the distances traveled separately into the formula above.
