First we need to figure out what percentage of all the questions she needs to get correct to pass both tests combined. Since each test is worth half of her total score, we need to calculate the percentages for each test separately.

For the second test, since it only has 40 questions, we cannot use this formula exactly as written because the denominator wouldn't be accurate. However, we can assume that since each test is worth half of her total score, there should be roughly 2 times as many questions on the first test than there are on the second test.
