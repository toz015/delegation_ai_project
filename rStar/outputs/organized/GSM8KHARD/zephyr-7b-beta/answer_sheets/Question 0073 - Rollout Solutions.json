This means subtracting a quarter of the original number. 7462704 - (7462704/4) = 5971428 pieces. Then we figure out how many her mom put down. We know it's a third of the remaining pieces. So we divide the remaining pieces by three. 5971428 / 3 = 1990476 pieces. Now we add them both together to get the total remaining number. 1990476 + 5971428 = 7961894.
