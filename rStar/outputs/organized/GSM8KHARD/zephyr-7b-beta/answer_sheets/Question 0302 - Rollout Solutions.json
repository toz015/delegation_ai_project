Let's calculate the number of sandwiches:\n\nNumber of Sandwiches = Total Meat (in pounds) / 1 pound per sandwich\n\nTotal Cheese (in pounds) = Number of Sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich * 4 servings per sandwich * 0.3 pounds of cheese per serving\n\nTotal Cost of Meat = Total Meat (in pounds) * $7.00 per pound\n\nTotal Cost of Cheese = Total Cheese (in pounds) * $3.00 per pound\n\nTotal Cost of Meat and Cheese = Total Cost of Meat + Total Cost of Cheese\n\nLet's put this into our formula:\n\nNumber of Sandwiches = Total Meat (in pounds) / 1 pound per sandwich\n\nTotal Meat (in pounds) = Number of Sandwiches * 1 pound per", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Let's say we want to find out how many sandwiches we need to serve 5979089 fans. If each sandwich feeds four people, then we need 5979089 / 4 = 1494772.25 sandwiches. Since each sandwich requires 2 pounds (one pound each of meat and cheese), the total weight of meat needed is 2889544.5 pounds (1494772.25 sandwiches times 2 pounds). The total cost of the meat is therefore the weight times the price per pound, or $299,169.40 ($7 per pound times 2889544.5 pounds). Similarly, the total weight of cheese required is also 2889544.5 pounds, so the total cost of the cheese is $866,493.50 ($3 per pound times 2889544.5 pounds).
