Let's call this number R. Then, 15 minutes later, there were still R cars stuck on the motorway. During this 15-minute period, some cars moved through, reducing the number of cars left on the motorway to R - s, where 's' represents the number of cars passing through during these 15 minutes. Using the fact that after another 15 minutes, another 20 cars passed through, we obtain: 20 = (R - s) - R + s. Solving this equation for s yields: s = (20 + 2R) / 3. But since s is the number of cars moving through during the initial 15 minutes, this number is unknown. We could solve this equation if we had another equation to relate the remaining number of cars to the number of cars moving through. However, we do not know how many cars moved through during the first 15 minutes. Hence, we cannot find out how many cars moved through during the initial 15 minutes.
