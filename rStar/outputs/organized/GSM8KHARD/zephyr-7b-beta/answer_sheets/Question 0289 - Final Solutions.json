James sends 428598 messages to Ms. Thompson's class. He delivers one-third as many messages to Mr. Yu's class. Let's call the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu's class X. Then one-third of X is the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu's class. We can write this as (1/3)X. To find out how many messages James delivers altogether, we add the number of messages sent to Ms. Thompson's class and the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu's class. 428598 + (1/3)X.

Condition 1 tells us that James sent 428598 messages to Ms. Thompson's class. Let's call this amount X. Condition 2 tells us that he delivered one-third as many messages to Mr. Yu's class. So let's say he delivered Y messages to Mr. Yu's class. Since one-third of those messages is equal to one-third of X, we can set up an equation like this:\n\nY / 3 = X / 3\n\nNow let's multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fractions:\n\nY = X\n\nSo if we know how many messages James sent to Ms. Thompson's class (X), we also know how many messages he delivered to Mr. Yu's class (Y). We can add these two amounts together to find out how many messages he delivered altogether.\n\nIn summary, James sends a total of X messages.

This means that the number of messages James delivers to both classes combined is 428598 (messages to Ms. Thompson's class) plus x (messages to Mr. Yu's class). Using algebra, we can write this as an equation:\n\nTotal messages delivered = messages to Ms. Thompson's class + messages to Mr. Yu's class (or: Total messages delivered = 428598 + x)\n\nNow we just need to solve this equation for x.
