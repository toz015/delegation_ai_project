Poppy started with 7462704 puzzles. She put a quarter of those on the board. That leaves three quarters left. Three quarters of what remains is what her mom put down.

So we divide the remaining pieces by three. 5971428 / 3 = 1990476 pieces. Now we add them both together to get the total remaining number. 1990476 + 5971428 = 7961894.
