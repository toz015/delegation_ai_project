Each employee makes 4000 dollars per month. To find the total salary per month, we need to multiply this with the total number of employees. When all 3 months are considered, the total salary would be (X + 60) times 4000, which simplifies to 4000 * (X + 60). But the question asked us to calculate the total amount of money spent on salaries after three months. Remember that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow due to inflation. So the company needs to pay interest as well. Let's assume the interest rate is r percent per year. We can convert this to decimal form by dividing by 100. So if the interest rate is r%, then the interest per year is 0.0r, and the interest per month is 0.0r/12. The formula to calculate the total amount of money including interest for three months is: Total Salary + Interest.
