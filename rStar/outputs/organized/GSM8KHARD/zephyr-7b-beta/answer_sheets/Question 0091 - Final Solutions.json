So 200 hours at $6914510 per hour is $1,382,902,000 ($1.38 billion) in salary costs alone.\n\nNext, let's figure out how much the hospital makes from the patients. Each patient is charged $200 per hour. Since each patient visit takes 0.4 hours, they pay $80. The hospital sees 500 patients every day, so the total amount the hospital makes from patient fees is $400,00 per day.\n\nFinally, let's subtract the total cost (salaries and patient fees) from the total revenue (the money the hospital", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A hospital sees 500 people a day.

Let's assume that the hospital charges doctors for only the portion of time they spend treating patients (other times such as meetings etc. Are not charged).
