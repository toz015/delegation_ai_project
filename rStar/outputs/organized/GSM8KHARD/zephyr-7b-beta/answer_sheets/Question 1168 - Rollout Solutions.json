Let's call the number of apples Joanne picked from average trees as x. Since Joanne picks half the apples from the shortest trees, we can say that Joanne picked x/2 apples from the shortest trees (half of whatever x turned out to be). Her sister picks twice as many as Joanne from the tallest trees and three times as many from the shortest trees. That means her sister picked 3*x/2 apples from the shortest trees (three times what Joanne gets) and twice as many as Joanne from the tallest trees. Together they picked 500 apples.
