First we find out how far the fog bank travels every 10 minutes. It goes 3 miles in 10 minutes. So it goes 3 miles every 10 minutes. To get the distance traveled in any time, you multiply the rate by the time. So let's call the time t. We know that the fog bank travels 3 miles every 10 minutes. That means it travels 30 miles (because 10 minutes is 0.5 hours) in half an hour (because 30 minutes is 0.5 hours). So if it travels 30 miles in half an hour, it should travel 60 miles in one hour. That's because if it travels 30 miles in half an hour, then it travels 60 miles in one full hour. And if it travels 3 miles every 10 minutes, then it travels 3 * 6 = 18 miles every 30 minutes. So if it travels 60 miles in one hour, then it travels 2 miles every 10 minutes. So we can say that distance is 2 miles per minute.
