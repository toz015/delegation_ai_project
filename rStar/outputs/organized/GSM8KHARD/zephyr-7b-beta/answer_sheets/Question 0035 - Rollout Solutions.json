Since we already calculated how many pounds will come off the comic books (15/4), we just have to figure out how many pounds will come off his toys, since they weigh half a pound each: 15 pounds total minus the pounds that came off the comic books is equal to the pounds that came off the toys: z = 15 - (15/4).

Let's find out by setting up an equation: 2184756 (pounds of comic books) + X (pounds of toys) = 15. Subtracting 2184756 from both sides, we get X = -15 + 2184756. Since weights cannot be negative, this means that Uriah doesn't need to remove any toys, because removing the required amount of comic books alone makes his bag 15 pounds lighter!

Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his bag. He knows that his comic books weigh 2184775.6 pounds and each one weighs 1/4 pound. To find out how many comics he needs to remove, we divide the weight we want to remove (15 pounds) by the weight per item (1/4 pound). This gives us 15 / 0.25 = 60 comics to remove. Uriah still has 8717992 - 60 = 8717932 comics left. As for his toys, we know that each toy weighs 1/2 pound. Let's call the number of toys x. Then their weight is x pounds. We can find the value of x by setting the weight of all the items (comic books and toys) equal to what's left: (8717932 * 1/4) + x = 21 - 15 = 6 pounds. Solving this equation for x we get x = (6 - 2184775.6)/(", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
