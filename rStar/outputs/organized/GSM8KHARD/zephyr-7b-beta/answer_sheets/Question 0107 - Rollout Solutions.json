Charlie has three times more friends than Dorothy. That means Dorothy has one third of Charlie's friends. James also has more friends than Dorothy, but four times more. This means James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Let's call the number of Dorothy's friends X. Then Charlie has 3X friends, and James has 4X friends. We can set up an equation like this: Charlie's Friends = James' Friends. Or, 3X = 4X. Solve for X: Divide both sides by 3. X = (4X) / 3. Cancel out the X's: X = 4/3 X. Since X is the same thing no matter how we write it, we can see that if X is in terms of itself, we can cancel it out. But here we have two different symbols, X and X'.
