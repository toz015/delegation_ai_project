After breaking each into 8 pieces, she had 96 pieces. But she gave some of those to the chickens. Let's assume that x number of pieces went to the chickens. Then she still has (96 - x) pieces left over. How many rolls came from those pieces? Well, she broke each roll into 8 pieces, so that means if we take the number of pieces and divide by 8, we will get the number of rolls. So let's compute this: she took (96 - x) pieces, which is equivalent to taking (96 - x) / 8 rolls. But she already knows she has 12 rolls left over! So she wants to make sure she doesn't accidentally count those 12 rolls again when she computes how many rolls came from the pieces she gave to the chickens. To do that, we're going to subtract those 12 rolls. So we can say that the number of rolls (excluding the 12 we know she already has) that came from the pieces she gave to the chickens is equal to (96 - x) / 8 - 12. This may seem like a complicated expression, but it breaks down simply: (number of pieces she gave to the chickens)/(number of pieces per roll)-(number of rolls she knows she already has).
