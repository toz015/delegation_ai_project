That difference is represented by the variable d, such that d is equal to the number of pomegranates Sheila bought minus the number of pomegranates Clara bought. Mathematically speaking, this means that Sheila bought d more pomegranates than Clara did. Since Sheila bought a huge quantity, we can approximate it using the number of pomegranates Clara bought.
