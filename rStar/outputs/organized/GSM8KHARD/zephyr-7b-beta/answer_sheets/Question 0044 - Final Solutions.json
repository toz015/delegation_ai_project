Aleena paid $56960408 during the first half of the year. During the second half, the charge is reduced by 10%.

Then we can find the new charge by multiplying the original monthly rate by the decimal: 9493403 * 0.9 = 8544060. Aleena will pay this new monthly rate for 6 months during the second half of the year. So the total amount she pays during the second half is 8544060 * 6 = $51264360.

In order for us to have a 10% decrease, we should calculate the original fee before the reduction as follows: Original fee = X * (1 + 0.1) = 1.1X. After the decrease, the remaining fee would be: New fee = 0.9*1.1X = 1X - X = X. The condition says that Aleena pays the same amount X during the second half of the year.
