Since James is one year younger than Corey, whose age is c, James's age is c-1. So, set d*(24*60*60)/(3600*365) equal to c-1. Using hint 1, Jackson's age can be found as j=c+2. To find j, solve the equation for j and substitute c-1 for d and simplify. The result is: j=(c-1)*(3600*365)/(24*60*60)+2.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 6}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Since we also know that James' age is 1726976, and James is one year younger than Corey, we have another equation: 1726976=c-1. Putting it together: j=c+2, 1726976=c-1. We need to eliminate the variable c. To do this, add both equations and get: j+c=1726980 (c appears twice, cancel the like terms). Then subtract the first equation: j-j=1726980-c (the left side equals zero because we only subtracted j from itself), divide by -1 (change sign because we want to isolate c): c=-1726980+j (we found the value of c using this formula).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
