So the total amount of water that he poured into his bottle was (0.25 liters from the first mug) + (the amount of water left in the second mug before pouring) = 0.25 + (0.75)(X/100) liters. To make sure the water is drinkable, we know that this temperature has to be at least 40 degrees Celsius. We can set up a system of equations to solve for X:\n\n(0.25 + (0.75)(X/100)) * 4 = 40\n\nNext, let's convert liters to gall", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
