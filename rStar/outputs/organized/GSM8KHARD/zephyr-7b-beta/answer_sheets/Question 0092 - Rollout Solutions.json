Since she hired 6537761 elves, one-third of those elves is equal to the number of elves who quit because of the vomiting children. To find how many elves she had before the quitting began, divide the number of elves she hired (6537761) by 3, since 1/3 of the elves quit.

We can find that number using the formula: Number Elves Left = Original Number Elves / 3. Then we calculate the number of elves that leave after being kicked by kids' feet: Number Elves Left After Being Kicked By Kids' Feet = Number Elves Left - 10 Elves Who Quit After Being Kicked By Kids' Feet.
