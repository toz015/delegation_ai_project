Let's say Jean still has 30 lollipops from the beginning (so there are a total of 60 lollipops). To find how many bags Jean can fill, we want to find out how many lollipops should go into each bag. We know the total number of lollipops Jean wants to put into the bags is 60. We also know that the number of lollipops in each bag is the same as the number that goes into one bag. Let's call this value x. Now we can set up an equation: x times the number of bags equals the total number of lollipops Jean wants to put into the bags.

After Jean eats 8714250 of the lollipops, there are 30 - 8714250 left. That's very large! It's so large we'll call it \"almost none\" for simplicity. Jean wants to fill a single bag with almost none lollipops. Since there are 8714250 lollipops, she needs almost none of them, which is less than one (but still greater than zero). Let's say she can fit exactly 1 lollipop into each bag. She would need almost none bags to hold all of them, but since we cannot divide by zero, let's just say she cannot fill any bags. However, if we assume that Jean somehow found a way to split lollipops into bags infinitely small, she could fill infinitely many bags with these remaining lollipops.
