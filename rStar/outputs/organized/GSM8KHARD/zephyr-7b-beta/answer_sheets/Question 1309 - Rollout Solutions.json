We know both Marin and Nancy eat 218983 apples a day. That's a very large number! But we can still calculate how many apples Marin eats using this information about Nancy. Since they both eat the same number of apples per day, we can say they both eat X apples per day. Now replace X wherever it appears below. 218983 apples a day means that Marin (and Nancy) eats X apples per day. Therefore, their combined daily apple intake would be 2*X or just X for short. Using this knowledge, let's figure out how many apples Marin eats. One day, Marin and Nancy each eat X apples for a total of 2X apples eaten in one day. I hope that helps!
