However, Peter wants to spend the same amount each day, whether it's for wooden or plastic action figures. Therefore, the average cost per action figure is the same, regardless of whether they're made of wood or plastic. Let's find out what this average cost is. Peter spends $6671520 over the course of the entire week. Each day, Peter spends an equal amount, divided among his action figures purchases, both wooden and plastic. We know that Peter spends $5 per wooden action figure and $2 per plastic action figure.

The total daily cost for Peter is the sum of the costs for wooden and plastic action figures, i.e., 5 * y + 2 * z = $X. By the end of the week, Peter will have a total of y * 3 wooden action figures and z * 3 plastic action figures. This is the total number of action figures he's bought. To calculate the total cost of all the action figures, we multiply their number by their average cost per action figure, which we found earlier. This gives us $X * (y * 3 + z * 3) = $6671520. Solve for X to get the total cost Peter spends each day. That's $X = \\frac{6671520}{y * 3 + z * 3}$. But we already know that Peter spends the same amount each day, namely, $X$. So, set our expression above equal to itself and simplify: $\\frac{6671520}{y * 3 + z * 3} = X$. Cross-multiply and simplify: $6671520 = X(y*3+z*3)$, which we can write as $6671520 = (5y + 2z)X$.
