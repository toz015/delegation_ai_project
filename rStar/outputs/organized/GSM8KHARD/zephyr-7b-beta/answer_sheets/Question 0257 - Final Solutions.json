First we find out how long the cooking class is. Since it takes three times as long as the yoga class on Tuesday, we know that 1 hour (the length of the yoga class) goes into 3 hours (the length of the cooking class). So the length of the cooking class is 3 times an hour, which is 3 hours.\n\nNow we add up the time spent at all these events:\n- Yoga class (Monday): 1 hour\n- Cooking class (Tuesday): 3 hours\n- Cheese-tasting event (Wednesday): 0.5 hours (we halved the duration of the cooking class)\n- Museum tour (Thursday): 0.5 * 3 = 1.5 hours (we converted the duration of the cooking class)\n- Errands (Friday): 2 hours\n\nAdding everything together, we get 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours.
