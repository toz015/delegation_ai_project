Each person pays $5 for mini-golf, $5 for arcade tokens, and $506,279,108 for each go-kart ride, for a total cost of $5n + 10n + $1,012,582 per ride.

Morgan's budget is $90. To figure out how many guests she can invite, we need to find the cost per guest and compare it to $90. Each guest spends $5 on mini-golf, $5 on arcade tokens, and $100 on go-kart rides. That's $100 + $5 + $5 = $100. So the total cost for all guests is $100N, where N is the number of guests. And Morgan's budget is $90. Setting these equal, we get: $100N = 90. Dividing both sides by 100, we get N = 0.9.
