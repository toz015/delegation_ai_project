We know that N needs to divide evenly into 30 (since April can only buy whole numbers), so N should be a multiple of 30. Let's say N = 3k, where k is a positive integer. The same goes for the roses - since April wants twice as many as the daisies, she needs 60 times as many plant pots as the daisies. This means that if D is the number of plant pots for the daisies, then D / 2 = 60 times as many plant pots as D for the roses. So D / 2 = 60D. Simplifying, this becomes D = 120.
