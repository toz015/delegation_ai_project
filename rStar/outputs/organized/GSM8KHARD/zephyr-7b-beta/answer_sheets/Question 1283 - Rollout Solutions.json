But remember, her monthly income is the result of finding S(5) before, since Sylvie should have completed 5 years by that time. Hence, we can write: Annual salary after 3 more years = Monthly income * 12 = S(5) * 12. Now let's calculate Sylvie's annual salary after 8 years of service. Ann. Sal. After 8 yrs = Monthly income * 12 = S(8) = S * (1 + 0.1)^8. Finally, here's how we can put everything together: Ann. Sal. After 3 yrs = S(5) * 12. Ann. Sal. After 8 yrs = S * (1 + 0.1)^8. Using these relations, you could find an approximate value for Sylvie's annual salary", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
