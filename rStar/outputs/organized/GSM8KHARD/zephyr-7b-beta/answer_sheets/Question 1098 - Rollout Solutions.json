To make sure Bernadette arrives before Wayne, it should hold that T - 5 > T. This leads to Bernadette's departure time being B > T - 5. Using our expressions for Bernadette's and Wayne's drive times, we can find out how much earlier Bernadette should depart than Wayne: b - w = t + 5 = (5 * 5891617) / 117625 * (B - T), so B - w = (5 * 5891617) / 117625 * (B - T + 5). Solving for B, we get B = [(5 * 5891617) / 117625 * (T + 5)] + w.

Since Wayne arrives at the exact scheduled time, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which is 5 minutes earlier. This means that Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theatre first. To find out exactly how much earlier she should leave than Wayne, let x be the number of minutes Bernadette should leave earlier than Wayne. Then, Wayne leaves at the scheduled time, so he leaves at time t = 0. Bernadette leaves x minutes earlier than Wayne, so she leaves at time t = -x. Using time dilation, we know that time passes slower for Bernadette, which means that Bernadette's clock runs slower than Wayne's clock. We can write Bernadette's clock time as Tb, which is related to Wayne's clock time Tw by Tb = Tw*(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2), where v is Bernadette's speed relative to Wayne's speed, and c is the speed of light. In our case, v is very small, since Bernadette's speed relative to Wayne's speed is very small compared to the speed of light (assuming both stars are in the same galaxy). So we approximate this formula as Tb ~ Tw*(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)~Tw. We want Bernadette's arrival time to be 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. Since their clocks run slower due to time dilation, their arrival times on each other's clocks will differ.
