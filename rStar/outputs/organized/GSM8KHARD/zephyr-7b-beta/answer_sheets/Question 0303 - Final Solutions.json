We know Elliott had already taken 7,500 steps. After jogging, he had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that while jogging, he took some steps, but less than 2,000 steps because he still had 2,000 steps left to take after jogging. Let's call the number of steps Elliot took while jogging x. So 2,000 = x + 2,000 - x. Simplifying this, we get: 0 = -x + 2,000. To solve for x, we subtract 2,000 from both sides to get: x = 2,000.
