That makes a total of 2287720 + 2x bolts.\n\nSince we know that the robe needs half as many white bolts as blue, we can substitute 2x into our expression for the number of bolts required for white.

When we substitute this value back into the expression for the total number of bolts required, we get:\n\nTotal Bolts Required = 2287720 + x\n\nNow, we want to minimize the total number of bolts required.
