The answer is 4.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "With hint 1, let's think step by step. First we find out how many discounts the customer received in their current shopping trip. Since they utilized a coupon that removes double the amount of savings from the price, they would get twice as many discounts as usual. Let's say the customer receives d discounts in their current shopping trip (we're not sure how many yet). Each discount is still worth $20, so their total discount is 2d*$20 = $40d. In addition, the customer received 4 discounts worth $20 each in their previous shopping trip. So the customer received a total of 4 + 2d discounts during both transactions. And each discount is worth $20. So the total value of all the discounts is (4 + 2d) * $20 = $80 + $40d. Let's find out how much the customer actually spent during this transaction. We know that they spent $43 and used their rewards. But rewards are just like discounts, because they effectively lower the price. The customer's reward is worth r dollars (again, we don't know how much it is yet", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
