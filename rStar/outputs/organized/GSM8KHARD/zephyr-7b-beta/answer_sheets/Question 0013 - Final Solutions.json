This pineapple drink has 15 liters, composed of three fifths water and two fifths fruit juice (so pineapple). That means she has 9 liters of water and 6 liters of pineapple juice. Altogether, she has 24 liters. Now, she spills 1010497 liters of the orange drink. Let's calculate how much water was in the orange drink she spilled: To do so, we need to find out how much orange juice she spilled, since we know that orange juice and water are mixed in a ratio of two thirds to one third.
