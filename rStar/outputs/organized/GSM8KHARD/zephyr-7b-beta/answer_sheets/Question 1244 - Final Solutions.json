Condition 3: The third house requires twice as many shingles as the first house. Question: How many cases of shingles will the third house need?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Since the first house uses fewer shingles than the second, we can call the number of shingles it requires x. Then the second house requires twice as many, so it needs 2x shingles. We know that together these two houses use all 229292 cases of shingles. So x + 2x = 229292. Let's solve this equation for x:\n\nx + 2x = 229292\n3x = 229292\nx = 229292 / 3\n\nNow let's find out how many shingles the third house requires. It needs twice as many shingles as the first house, which is x. So the third house needs 2x shingles.
