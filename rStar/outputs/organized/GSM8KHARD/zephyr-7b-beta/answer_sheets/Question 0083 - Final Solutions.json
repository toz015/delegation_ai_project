Since the expression inside parentheses results in a large number, it would take a large number of new containers to change the number of vehicles by 30. Therefore, the rounded value will be greater than 1340. This means that the number of new containers is most likely not a whole number, which indicates that the condition about the number of newly arrived containers being less than one thousand cannot be true. Hence, our answer is that either the number of newly arrived containers is greater than one thousand, or there might be another condition missing in this scenario.
