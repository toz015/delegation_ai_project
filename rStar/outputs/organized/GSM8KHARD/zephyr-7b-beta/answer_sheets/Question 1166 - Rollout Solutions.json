Condition 3: Currently, the bigger pool contains 4681732 times more water than the smaller one. Question: What is the current volume of water in the smaller pool?", "ost_step": {"1": "Jerry owns two pools."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. According to condition 3, we can say that the volume of water in the larger pool is 4681732 times more than the smaller pool. Let's call this quantity \"x\". Since it was twice the volume of the smaller pool four minutes ago, we can say that the volume of the smaller pool four minutes ago was half of x. At that time, according to condition 1, the rate of leakage of both pools was 4 gallons per minute. We know that over the course of four minutes, 16 gallons leaked out of both pools combined (i.e., 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes). Using the fact that both pools leaked the same amount during that time interval, we can find the volume of water that leaked out of the smaller pool during those four minutes. This leaked volume is equal to the difference between the total volume lost during that time interval and the volume lost by the larger pool. This difference is the product of the leakage rate and the time interval, minus the volume lost by the larger pool (which is found by multiplying its leakage rate by its volume differential over the same time", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
