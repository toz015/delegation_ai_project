Let's call the number of footballs F. If we have half as many helmets as footballs, then the number of helmets H is half of F. That is H = F/2.

Since we started with knowing that H = F/2, we can substitute it here: R = (F/2)/2. Simplifying this gives us: R = F/4. We also know that there were 20 helmets. Using our formula above, we can find the number of robots: R = F/4. 20 helmets means 20/2 = 10 helmets per football, so F = 20 * 10 = 200 footballs.
