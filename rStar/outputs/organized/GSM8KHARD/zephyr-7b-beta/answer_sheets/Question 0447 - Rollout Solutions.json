There are originally 8085399 rows of seats. Each row has 18 seats. So there are 8085399 * 18 = 146147182 seats altogether. Since one fourth of all seats were occupied by the administrators, one third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, and the rest by the students, we can write this mathematically as:\n\nOne Fourth Seats Occupied By Administrators + (Three Quarters of Seats Left) X Three Eighths Seats Occupied By Parents + Remaining Seats Occupied By Students = Total Number Of Seats\n\nSo our equation is:\n\nOne Quarter X Seats Total + (Three Quarters of Seats Total - One Quarter X Seats Total) X Three Eighths = Remaining Seats Occupied By Students\n\nLet's call the total number of seats 'S'. This leads to:\n\nOne Quarter X S + (Three Quarters of S - One Quarter X S) X Three Eighths = Remaining Seats Occupied By Students\n\nSolving for", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many students were there in the school auditorium?", "subanswer": {"text": "To calculate the number of students in the auditorium, we first find the number of seats not occupied by administrators or parents using the formula: UnoccupiedSeats = SeatsTotal - SeatsOccupiedByAdmin - SeatsOccupiedByParents.
