Well, let's look back at our first piece of information: Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy. Using our new variables x, y, and z (where x is the number of friends that Dorothy has), we can rewrite this relationship.

Since they both have some relationship to the variable y, let's combine them into a single expression: 3y friends for Charlie, and y friends for Dorothy.\nUsing similar logic for James, we can say that James has 4z friends, while Dorothy still only has z friends.\nPutting it all together, we now have", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
