Since 3/5 of each group brought back seashells, it would be roughly: 0.6 times the number of people in each group. Therefore, since there were about 21298 groups, we can estimate that this equals the number of people who brought back seashells. Roughly: 21298 * 0.6 = 127778 people. Finally, we need to figure out how many seashells these people brought back. Since everyone brought back 2 shells, there are 2 seashells per person who brought back shells. Thus, since we know roughly how many people brought back seashells, we can estimate the total number of seashells brought back: About 127778 people * 2 seashells each = Approximately 255556 seashells.

Since we are asked about bringing back seashells, let's call the number of seashells brought back by one group `x`. Each person in a group brings back 2 seashells. So, for each group, it would be 9 people times 2 seashells each, which equals 18 seashells. But not every group has an equal number of people. About 3/5 or 60% of these groups are needed for the competition. So, there would be about 120% or 2 groups for each real group, since we need 120% of the groups to get 60% of the original number of people. So, 1 group would become approximately 2 groups.
