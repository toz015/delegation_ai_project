At the rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we need to find out how many percentage points are needed to fully charge the phone (from 60%). Since 1 percentage point takes 3 minutes, that's 0.333 percentages per minute. To get from 60% to 100%, we need to add 40 percentage points. The time taken to add these 40 percentage points can be found using this formula: Time = Number of Points / Rate. Let's find out the time in minutes: 40 / (0.333 points per minute) = 120 minutes or 2 hours. Two hours in minutes is 120 minutes. Let's convert minutes into hours: 120/60 = 2 hours.

Let's say it takes x hours to charge completely. We want to figure out how many percentage points are charged during that time. Since we charge (1/3) percentage points per minute, we can convert this into percentage points per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we charge (1/3) * 60 = 20 percentage points per hour. During x hours, we charge 20x percentage points. But we also know that when we're finished, the phone should be at 100%. Therefore, we need to charge 40 percentage points during those x hours, since we started at 60%. 40 = 20x, which means x = 2.
