Each gallon costs $2296144 for lemons and $2 for sugar. That is a total of $2298146 per gallon. To calculate how many lemons were used, we first calculate how many lemons were used per glass. Since 20 glasses come from one gallon, 1 gallon contains 20 * (1/3 lb) = 6.67 pounds of lemons. Since 1 pound costs $11.47, each gallon costs $74.82 on lemons. Therefore, $2298146 / $74.82 = 307.41 pounds of lemons per gallon. 307.41 pounds of lemons contain about 614.81 lemons according to the USDA. So one gallon of lemonade uses about 614.81 * (1/3) = 204.94 lemons.

If Juan and Carlos made $25 in profit, we can find out how many glasses they sold using this expression: Profit/glass price \u00d7 number of glasses sold = Total profits ($25).

It takes 20 glasses to make one gallon, so we can find out how many gallons they sold using: Number of glasses sold / 20 = Number of gallons sold.
