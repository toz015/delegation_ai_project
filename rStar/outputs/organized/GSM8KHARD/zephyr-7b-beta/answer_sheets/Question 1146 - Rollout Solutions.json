First, let's find out how many chickens and cows Farmer Brown has. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, we can set up a proportion. Chickens : Cows :: Twice : Once.

Next, we can use algebra to isolate the variable x or y. I prefer to isolate x. To do this, we need to get rid of y, so we can divide both sides of the proportion by y. X : y :: 2 : 1 becomes x / y : y / y :: 2 : 1. Simplifying, we get x / y :: 2.
