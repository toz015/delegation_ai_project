Since both days are counted together, we can say that the total sleep duration was (6 hours per day) * 2 days = 12 hours. Third, starting from Thursday, we know that Sadie sleeps 1 hour more than the sleep duration on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. Therefore, we add this extra one hour to the sleep duration during Tuesday and Wednesday. This results in the total sleep duration on Thursday being (12 + 1) = 13 hours. Lastly, we need to add up all the sleep durations for the whole week. Adding the sleep duration for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the total sleep duration for Sadie for the entire week is: 8 hours (Monday), 12 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday), and 13 hours (Thursday); which adds up to 33 hours in total.
