First, we know that John runs an average of 60 miles per week, which means that he runs (60 / 7) = 8.57 miles per day. Next, since he runs three times, that would mean he's running approximately 25.71 miles on the first day (8.57 * 3), and the same distance on the other two days. \n\nNow, let's look at condition 3, which tells us that John spends 3 hours running on the first day, and the same amount of time running on the last two days, but only half as long as on the first day. This translates to an average running speed of (36 miles / 3 hours) = 12 miles per hour on the first day, and (25.71 miles / 1.5 hours) = 17.14 miles per hour on the last two days.\n\nTo calculate John's average running speed over the entire week, we add up all his miles run and divide by the total time spent running: (25.71 miles / 1.5 hours) + (2", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
