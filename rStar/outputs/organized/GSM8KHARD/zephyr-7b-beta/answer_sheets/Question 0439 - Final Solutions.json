Let's apply the 30% off discount: $0.3 * $2711115 = $813334. Subtract this discount to get the total amount without sales tax: $2711115 - $813334 = $1897781. Sales tax is calculated based on the remaining total after discount: $0.05 * $1897781 = $94889. Adding everything together gives us the total amount Joe pays: $1897781 + $813334 + $94889 = $2851964.
