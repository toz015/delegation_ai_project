Firstly, let's find out how many cards have an 'A'. Two fifths of Carly's cards have an 'A', so we can write this as: 2/5 * 1489106 = x. \n\nSecondly, let's find out how many cards do not have an 'A'. This would include all the cards which do not have an 'A' as well as the cards which do not have both an 'A' and a 'B'. The first part is easy: it's simply the remaining cards after removing the ones with an 'A'. Therefore, the second part needs to make up the rest. Since half of these remaining cards don't have a 'B', the remaining cards without 'A' or 'B' need to be five eights of those. Thus, our expression looks like: (1-x)/2 - 5/8*(1-x)/2 = y.\n\nSo the expression for the number of cards which neither have an 'A' nor a 'B' is: z = (1-x)/2 - 5/8*(1-x)/2.

That would be 2/5 of all the cards. So 1489106 cards with the letter A will be 2/5 of 1489106, which is 3978212 cards. Next, we want the number of cards without the letter A, so subtract those from our original amount. That leaves us with 1489106 - 3978212, which is 10918894 cards. Then, we can find the number of cards with the letter B by finding half of the remaining cards. Half of 10918894 is 5459447 cards. Finally, we find the number of cards with the letter C by finding 5/8 of the remaining cards. We still have 10918894 minus the ones we found earlier, so it becomes 5459447 - (5/8) of it.
