We know that Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her running speed is four times her walking speed (let's call her walking speed w). When she skips, it's half as fast as she runs, so her skipping speed is one-quarter of her running speed, or w/4. Let's see if we can find out how far she can run or walk in an hour, which might help us figure out how many miles she can walk in six hours. \n\nTo find out how far Dana can run in an hour, we need to multiply her running speed by how far she can run in an hour (let's call this distance r). Since she runs four times faster than she walks, we know that r/w = 4. Rearranging this equation, we get r = 4w. Plugging that into our formula for finding how far she can run in an hour, we get:\n\nrunning speed * distance = miles per hour\n(distance from above) / hour = miles per hour\n\nSo, we get:\n\n(4w) / hour * w = miles per hour\n\nSim", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Dana can run 24 miles in six hours because she runs at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. During these six hours, Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. When Dana runs, she goes four times as far as when she walks in the same amount of time, so she covers 24w miles during the one-third of the time that she spends running.\n\nWhen she walks, she goes w miles per hour, so she covers w miles in the two-thirds of the time that she spends walking. Adding up the distance covered while running and walking, we get:\n\n(24w) + (w * (2/3)) = (4/3) * w * 6 = 24w miles in six hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate how many miles Dana can skip in six hours using the fact that she skips at a rate of speed that's half as fast as she runs. Her skipping speed is w/4 miles per hour, so she skips w/8 miles in an hour. Therefore, she skips w/8 * 6 =", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
