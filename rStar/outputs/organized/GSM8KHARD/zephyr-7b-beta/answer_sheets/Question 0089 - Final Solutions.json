Now we can use addition to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together: L + A = Lily's friends + Amy's friends. Substitute L's friends for L: L's friends + A = Lily's friends + Amy's friends. This equation tells us that the total number of friends is the sum of Lily's friends and Amy's friends. We found out earlier what Lily's friends and Amy's friends are, so we can substitute them back into the equation: L's friends + A = L + 20. And we already know that L's friends is the same as L, so we get: L + A = L + 20.

From this, it's obvious that Lily's friend count is definitely greater than zero, since otherwise, Lily wouldn't have any friends at all, contradicting the information provided. Consequently, we can say that Lily's friend count lies somewhere between 1 and x friendships.\n\nNow that we know how many friendships Lily has, we can find out how many friendships Amy has by subtracting Lily's friend count from the number of friendships Amy gained after switching schools: Amy's friend count = x + 20 - Lily's friend count.
