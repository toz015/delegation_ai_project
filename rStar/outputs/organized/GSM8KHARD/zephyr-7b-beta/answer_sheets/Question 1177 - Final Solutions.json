But since the school as a whole is balanced between boys and girls, the number of boys and the number of girls in any individual class will also be balanced. So if we know how many girls are in the third class, we can use this balance to figure out how many boys are also in that class. Let's call the number of girls in the third class x. Then there will be 50% of x (or x/2) number of boys in that same class. Furthermore, we know that the total number of students in all the classes besides the first and second ones is 4899722. Since we want to find out how many boys are in the third class, let's say there are y boys in that same class. Since every student counts towards that total, we can write an equation that expresses this relationship: x/2 + y = 4899722 / (number of classes besides the first two). Solving for y yields: y = (4899722 * (number of girls in the third class)) / ((number of classes besides the first two) * 2).

Note that this formula works because the number of students in all the classes besides the first two is almost equal to the number of students in all the classes except for the first, second, and third classes. This is true because we assumed that the number of classes is very large, and each class has roughly the same number of students. Using this formula and our previously calculated value for x (namely 27), we get: y = (2449861 * 27) / [(4899762 - 40 - 2) * 2] = 1516171 students.

We know that the student body is split evenly between boys and girls, so if there are x girls, then there are x boys too. Since there are 20 students assigned to each classroom in this school, and there are 4899762 classrooms, then the total number of students is 20 * (x/2) * (x/2) * 4899762, since there are x boys and x girls. Using the given information about the first two classrooms, we can solve for x using two simultaneous equations. First, we know that there are 15 girls in the first classroom. This gives us 15 = 20 * (x/2). Second, we know that there are 12 girls in the second classroom, which gives us 12 = 20 * ((x/2) - 1). Solving these two equations simultaneously yields x = 24498.
