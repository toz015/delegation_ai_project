Assuming he is paid yearly, he pays taxes at a total rate of 20%, leaving him with 1,228,222,000 * (1 - 0.2) = 1,022,594,000 dollars annually. Subtracting his taxes, he takes home a net salary of 1,022,594,000 - 42,000 = 980,594,000 dollars annually. The answer is 980,594,000.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To compare his net pay for both jobs, we need to find out his net pay for Job B as well. We know his gross salary is $42,000, and his net income is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. He pays a tax rate of 10%, which would be 36,000 * 0.1 = $3,600 annually. So his net income after taxes is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400 annually. We can calculate his net pay by adding back the $6,000 in annual property taxes. This means his net pay for Job B is $38,400 annually. To compare the net pay between both jobs, we subtract the net pay for Job B from the net pay for Job A, or 980,594,000 - 38,4000 = $942,194,000. The answer is: 942,194,000.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
