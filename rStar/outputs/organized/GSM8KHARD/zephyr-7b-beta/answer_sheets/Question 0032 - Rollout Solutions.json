The formula for the number of floors (F) is F = U / (8 units per floor). Substitute 3U/4 for U and we get F = 3U/(4*8) floors, or F = 9U/(32) floors. But we already found out that U = 3U/4.

We still don't know what U is, but fortunately we can calculate it because we know how many units are both occupied and unoccupied, based on our previous calculations. The formula for Utotal is Utotal = 3U/4 + Uempty. Substitute for Uempty and simplify: Utotal = (3U/4) + (216/6762883)U. This equation helps us eliminate the variables and find out what U is. Solving for U is a lot easier when you realize that there are some factors that cancel out. The result is Utotal = (691/512)U. To avoid dealing with decimal fractions, we could use approximate values, like 3/4 and 5/4 instead. Anyway, now we have a formula to find out how many units are total in the building, and we can put it into our formula for F: F = 9U/(128*8) floors = 9U/(1024) floors. I hope I haven't lost anyone yet. The final answers are: F = 9U/(1024) floors, Utotal = (691/512)U.
