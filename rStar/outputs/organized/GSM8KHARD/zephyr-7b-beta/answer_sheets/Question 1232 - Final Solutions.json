Marcy made 2691134 candles. 5% of these are explosive candles. So there are 13456 candles that exploded. Now we have to figure out how many of those candles smelled like wet dog. Let's call this number x. We know that 5% of the non-explosive candles smell bad. So 0.95(2691134-x) is the number of non-explosive candles that don't smell bad. This equals 2537521.5 as I mentioned earlier. Rearranging the equation: 0.95(2691134-x) = 2537521.5. Solving for x: 0.95(2691134-x) = 2537521.5.
