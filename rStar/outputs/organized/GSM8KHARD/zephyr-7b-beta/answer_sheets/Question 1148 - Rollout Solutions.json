The number of cups in 3/4 of a cup is just the same as 3/4 of the number of cups in one cup, or 3/4 = 75%. This means that a batch of oatmeal cookies takes 75% of a cup of raisins.

Next, we don't know the exact amounts needed for the granola and snack mix, but we know that whatever is leftover (after using all the raisins for cooking) goes into these other dishes.\n\nLet y be the number of servings (or quantities) of raisins we use for both granola and snack mix combined. Since we're dividing the remaining raisins equally between the two, we set the amounts as the same quantity. This leads to the equation: (the rest of the raisins) / (the total servings / two) = y / 2. Solving this, we get y = (remaining raisins) / 2. Here, we still haven't determined how many raisins remain because we haven't finished allocating all the raisins.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many raisins go into all three dishes.
