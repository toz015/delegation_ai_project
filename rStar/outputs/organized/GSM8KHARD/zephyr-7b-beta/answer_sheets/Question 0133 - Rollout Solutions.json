However, if the trader bought x bags and sold n bags, then there should be (n - x) unsold bags still in his possession. These unsold bags didn't contribute any revenue or cost, so they are irrelevant here. The trader's net revenue should just come from the sold bags. In other words, the net revenue is given by the formula: Net revenue = Total revenue - Total cost = 30n - ($22)x - 2(n - x). This simplifies to: Net revenue = 32x - 4x = 28x.

First, we need to find out how many bags the trader bought. Since each bag cost $20, let x represent the number of bags he bought. The formula would look like this:\n\n$20 \u00d7 x$\n\nNext, we know that it cost $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse. Therefore, the transportation cost is found by multiplying $2 and the number of bags the trader bought, or:\n\n$2 \u00d7 x$\n\nNow, let's find out how many bags the trader sold and what price was charged per bag.
