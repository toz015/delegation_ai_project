The first class has 15 girls, which means it has 5 boys (because there are equal numbers of boys and girls). That's 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class. So the second class, which has 12 girls, must have 8 boys (because there are equal numbers of boys and girls). So the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8. Therefore, the number of boys in the third class can be found by finding how many boys are left over when you subtract the boys from the first two classes. That would be all the boys in the school minus the boys from the first two classes. We already know that the school is 50% boys. So half the remaining students are boys. To find the total number of students who aren't in the first two classes, count up all the students in the rest of the classes: there are 4899762 classes (which we know), and each class has 20 students (which we also know).
