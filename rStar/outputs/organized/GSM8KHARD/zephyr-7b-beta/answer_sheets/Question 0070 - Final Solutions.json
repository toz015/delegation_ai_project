That's a net gain of 18 potted plants, making 80 + 18 = 98. After gifting 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges, each ledge would have 1 potted plant remaining. This means we subtract 40 potted plants from the current total (80). We are left with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants.

After gifting 1 potted plant from each of her 40 ledges, each ledge would have 1 potted plant remaining.
