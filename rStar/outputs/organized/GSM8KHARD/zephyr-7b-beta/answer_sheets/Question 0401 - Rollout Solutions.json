The calculator costs $12. And the geometry set also costs $10. Altogether, we have $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.50 for all the school supplies without the discount.\n\nNow let's calculate the discount. Since it's a 10% discount, we subtract 0.10 times the original price. So we take the $20.50 and subtract 0.10 times $20.50, which is $2.05. So the discount is $2.05.\n\nTo find out how much Daniel has to pay after the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price. This leaves us with $20.50 - $2.05 = $1", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
