Collecting terms with x and y gives: $x + $y = $600. To find x and y, we need to solve this equation. To do this, we can create a system of equations:\n\n    $x + y = 600$\n    $k - a = 320$ (where a is Alexandra's amount)\n    $m - s = 400$ (where m and s are Maryam's and Sarah", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The girls are trying to raise money for a carnival.

Kim raised more than Alexandra, so let's call their amounts k and a, respectively. Using what we learned about Maryam, we can say: 700 is maryam's amount (in dollars), k is kim's amount (in dollars), a is alexandra's amount (in dollars). We also know that Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. That means: k is greater than a by $320 (in dollars). Subtracting a from both sides, we get: k - a is greater than 0 by $320 (in dollars). We can write this as a system of linear equations:\nk - a > 0, and maryam's amount is $700. Next, we know that sarah raised $300, and maryam raised $400 more than sarah. Let s be sarah's amount (in dollars) and maryam's amount is m. Our system becomes:\nm - s = 400, and mariahm's amount is $700", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
