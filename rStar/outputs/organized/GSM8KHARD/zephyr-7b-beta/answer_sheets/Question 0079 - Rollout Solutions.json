We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times as many photos as Brittany's can. Let's call the number of photos jamal's phone can hold x. And let's call the maximum number of photos brittany's phone can hold y. We also know that y is 50 times the number of birds in jamal's photo. 50 times the number of birds in jamal's photo is equal to the maximum number of photos brittany's phone can hold (y). So:\n\nx = 6 * z (where z is the number of birds in jamal's photo)\ny = 50 * z\n\nWe want to find z. Since we know both x and y in terms of z, we can set these equations equal to each other and solve for z.\n\n6*z = 50*z\n\nAfter dividing both sides by z, you get:\n\n6 = 50\n\nSince this isn't possible, our original assumption was wrong and there must be a mistake in the problem.

That is, if Brittany's phone could hold x bird photographs, then Jamal's photograph would need to have at most 6x/50 ducks in order not to overwhelm Brittany's phone. But we know that Jamal's photograph is being held on his phone, which can hold 1646864 bird photographs.

First, we found that the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold (x) satisfies both x < 6y and 50y <= x, where y represents the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Solving this system of linear inequalities gives us:\n\nx \u2264 300\n\nSince Brittany's phone holds less than or equal to 300 bird photographs, we conclude that x = 300. This gives us that Brittany's phone can hold 300 bird photographs. Next, using the hints again, we found that the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph (y) satisfies both y <= 6x/50 and 1646864 = 6y. Solving this system gives us:\n\ny \u2264 50414\n\nSo the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is at most 50414.
