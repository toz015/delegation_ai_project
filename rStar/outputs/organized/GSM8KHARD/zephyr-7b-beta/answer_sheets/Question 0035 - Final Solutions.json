Setting up an equation with these values, we get 15 = x / 4. Multiply both sides by 4 to find x. 15 * 4 = x. Solving for x, we get x = 60. This means that Uriah needs to remove 60 comic books. To find how many toys Uriah needs to remove, let's call the number of toys y. Each toy weights 1/2 pound. Y toys weigh y * (1/2) = y/2 pounds.

Currently, his backpack weighs 2280 pounds. So Uriah needs to eliminate another x pounds such that 2280 - 15 - x = Weight_target. Let Weight_target be our unknown. Our equation becomes 2280 - 15 - Weight_target = Weight_target. Subtracting Weight_target from both sides gives us 2265 = -2Weight_target. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us Weight_target = -1132.5 pounds, which is an impossible number because negative weights don't exist. Therefore, our assumption that Uriah could carry the initial weight plus 15 pounds is wrong, and thus Weight_target should be set equal to the remaining weight after removing the comics minus 15 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, and Uriah has eliminated 8717992 comic books, leaving behind some toys. Let's say Uriah's bag now contains y toys, and they weigh y/2 pounds. Then the total weight of toys in the bag is y/2 pounds. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to eliminate, we subtract the total weight of toys in the bag and the weight of comic books left behind from Uriah's weight target: 2265 = 2280 - 15 - y/2 - 8717992 * (1/4). Solving for y yields y = 8437500 pounds. However, we cannot have a fractional number of items (toys), hence rounding down will give us the nearest integer value.
