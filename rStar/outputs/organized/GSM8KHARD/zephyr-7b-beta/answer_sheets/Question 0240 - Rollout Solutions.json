We know the total number of employees is 2851496. Let's call the number of junior programmers J. We also know that senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers.

Since we know the total salary for both groups, we can find out the number of senior programmers based on their individual salaries.

Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, we need to subtract the salary of each junior programmer ($2000) and add $400 to get the salary of each senior programmer. That means the total monthly payroll is the sum of the payrolls for both groups of programmers. Using our expressions for X and Y, we can solve for the total payroll.

There are a total of 2851496 people working at the company, which includes programmers. Of those, two fifths or 40% are junior programmers.

Thus we can find out how much junior programmers are paid monthly: 1140598.4 junior programmers x $2000 per month = $2,281,196,928 ($2.28 billion) per month. We also know that the senior programmers earn $400 more than the junior programmers. So the salaries of the senior programmers are $400 higher than the junior programmer salaries.
