First let's figure out how many eggs red chickens and white chickens each produce daily.

Next, let's figure out how many red and white chickens Jerry has. Since there are two more white chickens than red chickens, we can say that the number of red chickens is r and the number of white chickens is w, where w is 2 more than r. Now let's find out how many eggs Jerry's chickens produce altogether. This is the sum of the eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens.
