First let's calculate how many team members and coaches need pizza.

That is a huge number, but since we aren't calculating that many guests, it's okay! So now we know that Maddy only needs to buy pizza for 12368962 team members and 3 coaches. Let's figure out how many pizzas she needs for them. If each pizza serves 3 people, and each person eats pizza, then each pizza feeds three people. The first thing we want to do is determine how many pizzas we would get if we divide our people by 3 (the amount fed by one pizza).

Maddy needs to buy enough pizzas to serve all those people. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we need to divide our total number of people by 3. Our number of people is around 3 trillion! So dividing it by 3 gives us roughly 1 trillion. Let's round down to a number divisible by 100 (since each pizza costs $15). That would be 1000000000 pizzas. We multiply this number by 15 to get the total price, which is just over $15 trillion! This is way too large. Since there are only finitely many dollars in the world, we have to round somehow. How can we reduce the number of pizzas without reducing the total cost too much? Notice that each team member brings exactly as many guests as team members. We could make the number of guests less than the number of team members. Suppose each team member brings only one guest instead of two.

Since each guest needs three pizzas (because three people share one pizza), we can find the number of guests by multiplying the number of team members and the number of guests per team member. Then we add the coaches who don't bring any guests, so 12368962 team members times 2368962 guests per team member is 289932720000000000 guests. Adding the 3 coaches is 289932720000000003 guests. Dividing this by three (since each guest needs three pizzas) gets us the number of pizzas needed. That would be 966442400000000000 pizzas. Divide the total number of guests by three again to get the number of people (both team members and guests).
