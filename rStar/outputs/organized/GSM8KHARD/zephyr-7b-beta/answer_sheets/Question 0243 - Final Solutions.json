However, since we don't know the number of non-ruin castles, we can only estimate this value using information that we do have. Let's assume that a constant percentage of all castles (not just ruins) are unmanned. Based on this assumption, we could say that the same percentage of non-ruin castles are also unmanned. Therefore, if half of the ruins are unmanned, then roughly twice as many non-ruin castles would need to be unmanned in order to maintain the same ratio.
