To find out how long Cameron can stay with this amount if he adds on 70 pesos per extra hour, we set up an equation: 70x = 2486356 - 1000, where x represents the number of extra hours. Solving this for x we get x = 35248 (rounded). This means Cameron can stay for 12+35=47 hours without exceeding the price of staying for 24 hours. Since he leaves at 10am, he stayed for 19 hours.

Therefore, since Cameron leaves the hotel before noon (10 am), it takes us less than 12 hours between his second check-in and departure time. From the information provided in condition 4, we know that Cameron leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is 24 hours after his initial check-in time. We also know that Cameron leaves before noon. Let's suppose that Cameron leaves the hotel at some time t between 12:00 AM and 10:00 AM. Let's find the value of t based on condition 4's departure time and our assumption that Cameron leaves before noon. Since Cameron leaves at time t, then it has been exactly t hours since his initial check-in time. At that time, let's consider the additional cost Cameron owes based on condition 3, where each extra hour is charged at 70 pesos. If Cameron leaves at time t, then he pays hourly fees for t - 12 = t - 720 minutes worth of time. If we convert these minutes to hours, we get (t - 720) / 60 = t - 120 hours. So the extra fee Cameron owes during his second stay is 70 pesos per hour times the number of hours he stays. This expression is 70 * (t - 120). Combining both sets of calculations, we find that the total amount Cameron owes is 1000 pesos from condition 1 during his initial 12-hour stay, plus the hourly fees for the rest of his second stay starting from his second check-in time up until his final departure time, minus the 1200 pesos paid during his initial stay. Using algebra, we can write this as 1000 - 70 * (t - 120), where the negative sign represents a deduction. Note that t cannot be greater than 1200 because Cameron leaves before noon. Therefore, the final departure time must be no later than 12 pm. So we replace the variable name t with 12 - c, where c denotes the number of hours passed since midnight.
