Since their friends found all of the remaining eggs, except for 10, let's call the number of eggs their friends found x. So x - 10 is the number of eggs their friends actually found. And since there are no missing eggs among the eggs found by the Smith twins, we know that the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins and their friends is just the sum of what the Smith twins found and what their friends found: 60 + x - 10.

When calculating how many eggs their friends found without the Smith twins, we figured out how many eggs were left over after removing the Smith twins' finds. Then, we discovered how many of those remaining eggs were found by their friends, excluding the 10 that went missing. We're almost done! Add up everything we know about. The Smith twins found 60 eggs, and we already calculated how many eggs their friends found without including the Smith twins. That means the total number of eggs found by everyone is the sum of the Smith twins' finds and the finds of their friends without including the Smith twins' finds plus the 10 eggs that went missing. Here's the calculation: 60 (Smith twins') + [how many eggs their friends found when not including the Smith twins] + 10 (missing) = Total number of eggs found. Substitute our previous findings into the equation to find out how many eggs were found in total. 60 (Smith twins') + [4083416 - 60 - 10 (remaining eggs)] + 10 (missing) = Total number of eggs found. Simplify it. 60 (Smith twins') + 4083406 - 70 = Total number of eggs found. Subtract 60 and 70 to simplify. This equals the total number of eggs found in our question. 4083406 = Total number of eggs found.
