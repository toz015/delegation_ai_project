Since they get 2 million reservations a week (7604587 reservations/night * 2 nights), we know how many tables they serve: 2 million / 4 (2 meals per table) = 500,00 tables. So each table spends $15 (two $5 meals + one $5 bottle of wine). 500,00 tables times $15 per table is $7,500,00. Since they charge $5 per meal, we can calculate how many meals they serve: 500,00 tables * 2 meals per table = 1,000,00 meals. At $5 per meal, this makes $5,000 from selling meals. Adding this to what they made from selling tables, we get: $7,500,00 + $5,000 = $12,500.

Of those 1 million reservations, they serve 2 meals and 1 bottle of wine to each person. That's 2 x 1 million = 2 million meals for the week, which costs them $5 million.
