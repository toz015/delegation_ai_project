Let's call the total number of days it takes to travel back and forth x. Since it takes x/3 days to drive back, it takes x - x/3 days to drive there. We know that this is equal to the number of days needed to take the bus, so we can set up an equation:\n\nx = 6 + (x - x/3)/2\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, you could use a calculator or an algorithm like completing the square.
