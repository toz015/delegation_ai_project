To buy the jacket and both pairs of shoes, Sara needs $30 for the jacket and 2 * $260 = $520 for the shoes, which equals $550 in total. Since Sara earned $20 babysitting, she has $10 initial cash plus $20 from babysitting, which equals $30. From mowing the lawn, her parents paid her $4 each time. Let's say mowed the lawn x number of times. This means $4 * x dollars were earned through mowing the lawn. We want to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn before she has enough money. Adding it all together, we get:\n\n$30 (initial cash) + $20 (babysitting) + $4x (mowing lawn) = $550 (total cost of items)\n\nWe can isolate x here. Divide everything by $5.\n\n$30/5 + $20/5 + $4x/5 = $110 (Total money Sara needs to have)\n\nSimplify:\n\n6 + 4", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
