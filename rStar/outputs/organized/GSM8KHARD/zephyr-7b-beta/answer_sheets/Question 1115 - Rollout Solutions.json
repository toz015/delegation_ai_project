But since all of the other eggs were found, and the Smith twins found 60, and there were a total of 4083476 easter eggs hidden (according to condition 1), we can use math to figure out how many eggs their friends found. First, let's calculate how many eggs their friends found when they weren't including the Smith twins. There were 4083476 - (the number of eggs the Smith twins found) = 4083476 - 60 = 4083416 remaining eggs.

When calculating how many eggs their friends found without the Smith twins, we figured out how many eggs were left over after removing the Smith twins' finds. Then, we discovered how many of those remaining eggs were found by their friends, excluding the 10 that went missing. We're almost done! Add up everything we know about. The Smith twins found 60 eggs, and we already calculated how many eggs their friends found without including the Smith twins. That means the total number of eggs found by everyone is the sum of the Smith twins' finds and the finds of their friends without including the Smith twins' finds plus the 10 eggs that went missing. Here's the calculation: 60 (Smith twins') + [how many eggs their friends found when not including the Smith twins] + 10 (missing) = Total number of eggs found. Substitute our previous findings into the equation to find out how many eggs were found in total. 60 (Smith twins') + [4083416 - 60 - 10 (remaining eggs)] + 10 (missing) = Total number of eggs found. Simplify it. 60 (Smith twins') + 4083406 - 70 = Total number of eggs found. Subtract 60 and 70 to simplify.
