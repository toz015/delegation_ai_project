Let x be the amount of time that Jack plays for in minutes. Then his friends play for (1/2)x and (1.5)x minutes. We can set this up mathematically as:\n\n(1/2)x + (1.5)x + x = 120 (minutes in 2 hours)\n\nNow let's find out how many quarters each person needs to pay. Each friend pays 1 quarter every 20 minutes they play. Since Jack plays for x minutes, he uses (x/20) quarters. Similarly, the friend who can only play for half as long uses (1/2)(x/20) quarters and the friend who", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
