She wants to divide the bag equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, first we find out how many batches of granola can be made using the same strategy as we did for the oatmeal cookies: We need the number of batches so that the amount of raisins used is proportional to the amount of raisins Heather expects to use for making all three items. Let's write this number of batches as x. Next, we use the fact that there is a fixed amount of raisins in the bag, and then divide that equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. Let's call the amount of raisins used for each item y for the cookies, z for the granola, and w for the snack mix. Note that we expect y, z, and w to be fractions, since Heather knows that the amount of raisins needed per item will be less than the entire bag. Using the distributive property, we see that the total number of cups of raisins is x * y + x * z + x * w. We want this total to match the total number of raisins in the bag, which is 6483268. So, let's set up an equation: x * y + x * z + x * w = 6483268. We can solve for any one of the variables (x, y, z, or w). As an example, let's find out how many cups of raisins go into each batch of granola (z): We replace the terms with variables in our previous equation with their corresponding values: 6483268 = x * y + x * z + x * w. Then, we substitute our new variable for the number of batches of granola, x, into the second term: 6483268 = x * y + z * x + x * w. Factor out the common term, x: 6483268 = x * (y + z + w).

Using condition 1 again, we calculate:\n\nNumber of raisins per cookie = (6483268 cups) * ((3/4) cup raisins) / (cups) = 86448 raisins\n\nNow we need to figure out how many cups of raisins are in one batch.
