Since each box has 40 baseball cards, we can find out how many baseball cards there are by multiplying the number of boxes by 40: (b/9668743) * 40 = b/24166851. Now, let's see what happens when she distributes cards to her students. She keeps 50 cards, so that leaves 950 cards to distribute among her students. Each student receives 10 cards, so that means there are 95 students who receive cards. This way, we know that she has 95 students, and since she has 150 basketball cards and each student gets 10 baseball cards, she can calculate how many baseball cards remain using the formula: (b", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
