We know that it takes 8484275 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway, which is 135,505,263.7412 kilometers in total. This implies that each kangaroo covers an equal share of the distance. Hence, the distance covered by a single kangaroo is 135,505,263.7412 km divided by the number of kangaroos. Let's call this distance x kilometers. The time taken by a single kangaroo to travel x kilometers is x divided by the speed of a single kangaroo (let's call this y km/h). In other words, it takes y hours for a single kangaroo to travel x kilometers. This is also the average speed of all 8484275 kangaroos, because they all cover an equal share of the distance in the same amount of time. Now, let's move onto our four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. Let's call their individual speeds y/2 km/h. The distance covered by each turtle in one hour is (y/2) km/h * 1 h = y/4 km. In order to travel the whole distance, each turtle needs to travel this distance four times. This yields a total distance of four times the distance covered by each turtle. Let's call this distance z. Here's where the problem gets messy: we don't have enough information to solve for z. To get z, we'd need to divide it by the total time required for our four turtles to travel this distance, which would depend on the speed of the slowest turtle.
