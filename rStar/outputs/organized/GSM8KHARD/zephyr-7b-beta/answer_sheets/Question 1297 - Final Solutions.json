When measuring by inches, we know that one inch of paper contains exactly 1 page, but when measuring by pages per inch, we know that one inch of paper contains exactly 0.5 pages. We can convert pages to pages per inch by dividing the number of pages by the number of pages per inch.

First, we need to figure out how many pages are in an inch (when measured in pages per inch). Since one page is printed on each side of a piece of paper and paper is stacked 7419427 pages to the inch, that would mean there would be twice that number of pages per inch when only one side of the paper is considered. Therefore, when measuring in pages per inch, there would be half as many pages in an inch, or 3709713.5 pages per inch. Using this information, if the entire book is 1, then the book is made up of exactly one inch of paper. When measuring by inches, we know that one inch of paper contains exactly 1 page, but when measuring by pages per inch, we know that one inch of paper contains exactly 0.5 pages. We can convert pages to pages per inch by dividing the number of pages by the number of pages per inch.
