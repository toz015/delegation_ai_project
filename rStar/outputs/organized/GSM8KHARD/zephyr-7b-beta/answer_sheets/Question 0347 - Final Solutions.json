We can assume that the number of students without a dairy allergy is greater than or equal to 23, based on Hint 1. However, we cannot determine the exact number since we do not know how many students have both an allergy to dairy and an allergy to peanuts, which makes finding the complementary event difficult. Based on the provided information, our best guess would be to say that the number of students who do not have a dairy allergy is likely more than the 9 students who do have a dairy allergy, but we cannot say precisely how many students fall into this category.
