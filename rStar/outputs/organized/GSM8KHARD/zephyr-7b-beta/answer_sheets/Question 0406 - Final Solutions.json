Secondly we calculate the number of holes for remaining buttons i.e. With 4 holes. For every button with 4 holes, there are 4 holes. So we can say that the remaining buttons (i.e., those which were not counted while calculating the holes from the buttons having 2 holes) have 4 holes each. So we can say 21 - 8599584 = x (x being the no of buttons with 4 holes). We know that x buttons have 4 holes each. So the total number of holes due to these buttons would be equal to x*4.
