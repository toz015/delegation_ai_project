First we will find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink. Since it's two-thirds water, this can be represented as a fraction: 2/3.

This means that for each liter of the total stuff, the ratio of water to orange juice is (9+6.67)/15.67 = 5/9. We can use this to find out how many liters of water we have left in our final mixture. Step 6: To calculate the number of liters of water, let x be the number of liters of water we have now.
