Brandon's dog has 12 puppies and 9623102 of them have spots.

From condition 2, we don't know how many puppies have spots in Brandon's litter. Let's say it's x. Since we want to find out how many puppies have spots in both litters, those puppies would need to be born from either Jennifer's dog or Brandon's dog. We can't have puppies with spots born from both dogs, since one of them has three already. That means either Jennifer's dog or Brandon's dog has all the spotty puppies in common. But we don't know which one, so let's suppose it's Jennifer's dog. Therefore, the puppies with spots that are born from Jennifer's dog will also appear in Brandon's litter (since they're the same puppies). That means x is equal to the number of spotty puppies in Jennifer's litter. From condition 1, that's three. Therefore, the number of puppies with spots in both litters is exactly the same as the number of spotty puppies in Jennifer's litter, which is 3.

In our case, we don't know how many puppies are in Brandon's litter yet, but we can calculate that too. Brandon's litter consists of twelve puppies, and there are three in Jennifer's litter that belong to both groups (as explained above). That makes a total of thirteen puppies with spots between both litters. Since we don't know how many puppies are in Brandon's litter, we can use variables to represent the unknown values. Let's say that Brandon's litter has y puppies. Using what we've learned, we can calculate that the total number of puppies in both litters is the sum of twelve (Brandon's litter) and eight (Jennifer's litter), plus the number of spotty puppies in Jennifer's litter that are also included in Brandon's litter: 12 + 8 + 3 = 21 puppies in total. Therefore, the percentage of puppies with spots is: (number of spotty puppies / total number of puppies) * 100%. Or: (13 / 21) * 100% = 62% of all the puppies have spots.
