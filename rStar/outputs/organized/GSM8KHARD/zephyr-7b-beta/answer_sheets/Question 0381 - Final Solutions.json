From hint 1 we know Ali has $80 left over after sending half to his sister. Of the remainder, 3/5 is spent on dinner. Let's call the amount Ali spends on dinner X. We can write the expression as X = (3/5) * r, where r is the remainder after he transferred half his collection to his sister. Now let's solve for r. We get r = X / (3/5). Substituting back into our expression for Ali's initial savings, we find that initially Ali had ($400 - $80 - $X) dollars. Combining this with our expression for r, we obtain:\n\nInitial Savings = ($400 - $80 - X) Dollars\n\nWe need to find the value for X, but this can only be found once we know what Ali spends on dinner. However, since we know Ali's initial savings, we could use this expression as a system of linear equations and substitute values for X until we find the correct one. But instead, let's look at our original problem again. We want to determine Ali's bank", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
