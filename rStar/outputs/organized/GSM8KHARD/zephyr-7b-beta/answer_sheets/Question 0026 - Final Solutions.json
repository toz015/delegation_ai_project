We can find w and then h by combining our results for x and y. We know that Dana's walking speed w is one-fourth of her running speed (because she runs four times faster than she walks), so w = y / 4. Substituting this expression into the formula for Dana's total distance traveled, we get:\n\nTotal distance traveled = 12w + 4w = 12y / 4 + 4y / 4 = 16y / 4 = 4y = 12whours\n\nWe want to find out how many miles this is, so", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
