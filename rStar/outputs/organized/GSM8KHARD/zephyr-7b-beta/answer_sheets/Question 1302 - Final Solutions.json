To find out what Patty charged for this specific repair, we need to calculate the total cost for both labor and parts. Firstly, let's calculate the cost for labor. Since the plumber spent 2.25 hours working, the cost for labor is 2.25 times $107.84, which equals $234.55. Secondly, let's calculate the cost for parts. The plumber used $60 worth of parts. This is the exact amount of parts costs we can use as it is not specified whether parts costs include taxes, if any, or any additional fees. Thirdly, we know that Patty's Plumbing charges a flat fee of $40 for visits. This flat fee is added to the total cost calculated above for both labor and parts. Therefore, the total cost for this specific repair is equal to the sum of the costs of both labor and parts, plus the flat fee for visits ($40).

Patty charges a flat fee of $40 for visits. This visit took 2.25 hours. So the first part of the fee is $40.

There are 60 minutes in an hour. 2.25 hours equals 135 minutes (2.25 times 60). So 135 divided by 60 is a little less than 2.25 full hours, but more than 2.25 partial hours. Since Patty charges for partial hours as well, let's round down to 2 full hours and 0 partial hours. That means we need to pay $107.84 for 2 hours. So the second part of the fee is $215.68.

Patty's Plumbing charges $40 for the visit, which is a flat fee. Additionally, for the first hour of work, they charge $107.84 (for both labor and parts).
