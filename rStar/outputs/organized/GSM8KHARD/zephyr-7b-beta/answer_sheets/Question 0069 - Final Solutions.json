Since Harry slept D more hours than James, we have Harry slept X + D hours, and James slept X - D hours. Subtracting the two expressions, we get: D = X - (X - (2/3)X). Simplifying, we get D = (1/3)X. Finally, solving for X, we have X = (3/4)D. Using this expression, we can substitute X into our original equation for the total hours slept. We get: (3/4)(D) + (2/3)D = (5/3)D hours slept in total.
