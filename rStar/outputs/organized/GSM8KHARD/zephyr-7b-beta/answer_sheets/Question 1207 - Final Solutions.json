Let's call this time T.\n\nNow we can calculate how much revenue Millie generates during this time period. With each sale, she charges $1 per serving. Thus, in T hours, she generates 36 servings * $1/serving = $36 in revenue.\n\nWe also need to consider the cost side. To find out how much it costs her to manufacture these 36 servings, note that she makes them at a cost of $1 per serving, which comes to a total manufacturing cost of: $36.\n\nSubtracting the manufacturing cost from the revenue generated, Millie's profits during the T-hour working session would be: ($36 - $36) = $0.
