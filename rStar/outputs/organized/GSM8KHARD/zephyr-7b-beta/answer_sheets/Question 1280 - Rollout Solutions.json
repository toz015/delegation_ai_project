X - 38 is the number of bandages they had left at the end of the first day. \n\nOn the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than they did on the first day (because 10 less means they used fewer bandages). That comes out to be: x - 38 - 10 = 28. \n\nOn the third day, they ordered two bulk packs (this means they ordered twice as many bulk packs as they had on the first day), and they only used half a pack (because half a pack is 25 bandages). \n\nFirst, we'll find out how many bandages came from these two new bulk packs. Each bulk pack has 50 bandages, but since they only used half a pack, they only used 25 bandages. 2 * 25 is 50 bandages from these two new bulk packs", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
