We can use integer division to find the whole number of pairs, because we're not concerned about any fractional part of a pair here. So let's divide:\n\n33501940 / 2 = 16750970.\n\nSo that's how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs!

Since Mario has 8374485 dogs, and each dog has four legs, we can calculate the number of legs using simple math:\n\n8374485 dogs * 4 legs per dog = 33501940 legs\n\nWe want to buy snowshoes for each leg, so we need to multiply the number of legs by the cost of snowshoes per pair:\n\n33501940 legs / 2 (since we only need one pair per leg) * $12.00 = $39,607,200.00\n\nThat's a lot of money!
