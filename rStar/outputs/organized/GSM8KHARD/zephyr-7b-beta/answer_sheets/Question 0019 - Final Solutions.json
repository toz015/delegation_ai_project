Question: How far does Henry pedal between his initial pitstop and final one?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How far does Henry cycle until his final pit stop?", "subanswer": {"text": "Henry starts biking at 0 miles, stops once at 20 miles, and then continues until his final stop. Then the distance covered since his first stop would be the difference between the final location and the place where the second stop is made. From the condition, we know that the second stop occurs 15 miles prior to finishing the journey; hence, the distance travelled between the final and second stops would be the length of the entire ride minus the lengths of the first and second stops (the last leg of the trip). That is, 60 miles - 20 miles - (-15 miles) = 25 miles. Therefore, Henry's total distance cycled between his first and last pit stops is 25 miles.
