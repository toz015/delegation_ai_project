The price of one lollipop is $1.2857142857142858, so let x be the price of one candy. Since there are four candies, their total price is 4x. We know that the total price is $3.20, so we can say: $3.20 = 5 * 1.2857142857142858 + 4x$. Simplifying, we get $3.20 = 6.428571428571429 + 4x$, and then solving for x: $x = (3.20 - 6.428571428571429) / 4 = 0.5625$ cents.
