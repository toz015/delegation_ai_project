Solving this equation for b gives us 9649216 slices. This is because when you multiply the number of friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas by the number of slices in one pizza multiplied by 2/3, it will result in the number of slices those two friends actually ate. Therefore, the two friends who didn't eat as much as Bryce and the two friends who ate 2/3 of their pizzas ate a total of 9649216 slices.

That means they left (1 - 2/3) = 1/3 of their pizza uneaten as well. This means that out of all six friends, there are (4 - 2) = 2 friends left who ate \u00be of their pizza each. We can represent this situation in a table, like so:\n| Friend | Pizza (slices) | Eaten (slices) | Uneaten (slices) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bryce | 6074464 | 4049643 | 2024821 |\n| Friend 1 | 6074464 | 4049643 | 2024821 |\n|", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Denote the number of slices left by the remaining two friends as `x`.", "2": "Bryce's friend who ate 2/3 of his pizza had initially `(6074464) * (4/3)` slices. After eating 2/3 of that amount, he had `(6074464) * (4/3) * (2/3)` slices left, which equals `(6074464) / (9/3)` or `(1824822)` slices.", "3": "The other friend who ate \u00be of his pizza had initially `(6074464) * (4/3)` slices. After eating \u00be of that amount, he had `(6074464) * (4/3) * (3/4)` slices left, which equals `(1824822)` slices."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
