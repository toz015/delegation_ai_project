We know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Let's call the number of dahlias x. So x is 7 more than the number of roses. Let's call that number r.

We can substitute our equation for x into the original equation: \"There are 8043777 roses\" means the sum of the number of roses and the number of dahlias is 8043777. So: r + x = 8043777.\n\nSubstitute our first equation to get: r + (r + 7) = 8043777. Simplify: 2r + 7 = 8043777. Solve for r: r = (8043777 - 7) / 2. That's: 4021888.

Substituting our expressions for r and x, we get: r + x = 8043777. Substitute the values we found above: 4021888 + 4021895 = 8043783. The answer is: 8043783.\n\nWhat a lot of numbers!
