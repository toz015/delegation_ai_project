To figure out how many days it takes him to save enough money, we need to find when his bank account balance reaches 800 (the starting amount plus the cost of the bike). The formula for finding the total amount in the bank account is: BankAccountBalance = StartingBankAccountBalance + TotalEarnings - CostOfBike. So 800 = 50 + 1736265*n - 300. Solving for n: n = (800 - 50) / (1736265 - 300) which is approximately 1.67495 days. However, we can't have decimal days, so we round up and say that Mark needs 2 full days to save enough money.
