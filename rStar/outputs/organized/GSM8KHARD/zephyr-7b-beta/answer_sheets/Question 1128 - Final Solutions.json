Let's call the original number of beakers 'b'. Using this information, we can write two equations:\n\nIgor brought back half the test tubes, so we know there were half as many test tubes on the bench as there would have been if all of them arrived. In other words, the ratio of test tubes to beakers on the bench is the same as the ratio of test tubes to beakers that were requested, but half as many test tubes arrived. This leads us to equation one:\n\n29 / (8273687 * 0.5) = (7 + b + 2) / 7\n\nNow let's look at the Petri dishes.
