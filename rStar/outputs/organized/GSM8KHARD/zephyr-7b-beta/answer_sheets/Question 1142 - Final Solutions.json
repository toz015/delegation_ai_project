Now let's find out how far along she was when the update happened. Suppose she was 40% done, so 40% of 990412000 GB is 396164000 GB, and this many bytes equals some number of megabytes (we'll call it x). So 396164000 / 1024 is x, or equivalently, x * 1024 = 396164000, or equivalently, x = 396164000 / 1024 = 372480.

She restarted the download from the beginning, which took her the same amount of time it normally takes her to download 1 GB (0.165 minutes). During the update, it took 990412000 / (99041200 * 60) = 0.165 minutes to download 1 MB. Since Carla was already 40% done, she had downloaded 0.4*990412000=396164000 GB. This many bytes equal some number of megabytes (let's call it y). Therefore, 396164000 / 1024 = y, or equivalently, y * 1024 = 396164000, or equivalently, y = 396164000 / 1024 = 372480. At the time of the restart, Carla had downloaded a total of (y+x) megabytes. Now we can calculate the number of megabytes she downloads during the normal part of the download. We know that normally, Carla downloads 990412000 / (99041200 * 60) = 0.165 minutes to download 1 MB. Using similar reasoning, Carla downloads (990412000 - (x+y)) MB normally. So in total, Carla downloads (x+y) MB during the update and (990412000 - (x+y)) MB normally. Now we can compute how many megabytes Carla downloads in total: (x+y) MB during the update plus (990412000 - (x+y)) MB normally. To convert megabytes to gigabytes, divide by 1024. Therefore, Carla's total time to download is the sum of the times taken to download during the update and the times taken to download normally.
