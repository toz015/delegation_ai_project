We know there were 1789130 customers on the second day. By the third day, there are 500 customers. Since there were more customers on the second day, it means that some customers left the store between the second and third day. To find out how many left, we need to subtract the number of customers remaining on the third day (500) from the number of customers on the second day (1789130). The number of customers leaving is therefore 1789130 - 500 = 1784130. If we call this number k, then the number of customers who stayed until the third day was 500 minus k.
