We don't know exactly how much the speed grows with each lesson, but we do know that the rate of change is constant.

And at 8767805 WPM, the slope is also zero because his speed already reached its maximum (which probably doesn't exist in reality). Therefore, the slope is somewhere in between these two points. We can calculate the slope as follows: The position function is P(t) = t*47, where t is the number of lessons.

We know that initially Jared types at 47 WPM, and after instructional sessions he can type at up to 8767805 WPM (which is extremely fast). We also know that with further training, Jared's typing speed increases by 5 WPM.\n\nWe want to find out the average typing speed based on three different measurements. To calculate the average, we need to add up all three speeds and divide by three.\n\nFirst measurement: Jared's initial speed of 47 WPM\nSecond measurement: Jared's speed after instructional sessions, which we'll call x WPM\nThird measurement: Jared's speed after further training, which is x + 5 WPM\n\nAdding up all three speeds, we get:\n47 WPM (initial speed) + x WPM (speed after instructional sessions) + (x + 5) WPM (speed after further training) = Total speed\n\nLet's simplify this expression. Firstly, note that Jared's speed after further training is just his speed after instructional sessions, plus 5.
