The ratio of green jelly beans to blue jelly beans is 100% to 1%. Let z be the number of green jelly beans and w be the number of blue jelly beans. Then, z = 100w.\n\nHint 3: Combining the hints, we can find the relationship between z and y using the equation z = 100w and our expression for w (which is based on x and y).
