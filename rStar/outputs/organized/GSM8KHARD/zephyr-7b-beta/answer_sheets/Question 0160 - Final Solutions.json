Originally, the water tank had 120 liters of water. Celine took away 2959406 liters, leaving only 0.12 liters in the tank. Then she collected rainwater, which was double this remaining amount. So the rainwater was 0.24 liters (double 0.12). Adding this together, Celine now has 120 - 2959406 + 0.24 liters in the tank. This is equivalent to 0 liters since we cannot have a decimal amount of liters. Since we know that 0 = 0 liters, there are zero liters left in the tank after Celine took water out and collected rainwater. Therefore, the answer is: 0. However, this doesn't make sense because we can't have negative numbers of liters in a water tank, so let's assume that Celine's tank could never become empty.

But as Celine also collected 120 liters of rainwater, the net change of the water level would be 120 - 2837486 = -2825366 liters. However, the answer should be a positive value. So we'll consider Celine didn't lose any water due to leakage or evaporation. In such scenario, the answer would be: Initially there were 120 liters of water in the tank. Celine took out 2959406 liters, and added 120 liters of rainwater (twice the amount left) back.

The answer is 0 (not considering the loss of water due to leakage or evaporation).
