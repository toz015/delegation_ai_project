That leaves us with the remainder, which should equal the weight of the remaining portions. So let's say each portion has X weight. We can write this as X * 2048443 = 19 (the weight of the remaining portion). Since we know that each cake portion weighs X ounces, we can find out the weight of one portion as follows: 20 / 2048443 = X / 19. Let's solve this equation: 20 * 19 = X * 2048443. Solving for X would require some heavy arithmetic, so instead I will use approximation techniques. 38000 is roughly equal to 2048443, so we'll use that value for simplification. 20 * 19 = X * 38000.

In other words, the weight of the leftover cake is Y times the weight of the remaining portion. To get Y, note that all portions combined weigh 2048443 ounces. Of these, the weight of the portions consumed by Rory and her mother equals the weight of two portions, or 2 * X ounces. This means that the weight of the remaining portion, or Y ounces, plus the weight of the two consumed portions, or 2 * X ounces, adds up to the total weight of all the portions consumed and the remainder. In mathematical terms: Y + 2X = X * 2048443 = 19 * 20. Subtracting 2X from both sides yields Y = 17X. Using the fact that each portion weighs X ounces, we have Y = 17X. However, since we don't want to calculate this using the complicated formula from earlier, let's approximate Y with 38000 minus the weight of two portions (which is roughly equal to 76000X). Thus, our estimate is: Y = 38000 - 2 * X. Plugging this back into the formula above, we obtain: Y + 2X = 19 * 20 = 38000. Solving for Y, we obtain: Y = 38000 - 2X. This gives us an expression for Y in terms of X. Substituting the value of X from question 5.1, we get: Y = 38000 - 2 * (20 / 19 * 38000) = 20 ounces.
