Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. First let's find out how old Ben's iPhone is. Let's call Ben's iPhone age B. Since Brandon's iPhone is four times older than Ben's iPhone, we can write that in equation form: Brandon's iPhone age = 4 * Ben's iPhone age. We also know that Ben's iPhone age is two times Suzy's iPhone age, so let's say Suzy's iPhone age is S. We can write this as an equation too: Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age. To solve for Ben's iPhone age (B), we can substitute Suzy's iPhone age (S) into the equation for Ben's iPhone age: Ben's iPhone age = 2 * Suzy's iPhone age.
