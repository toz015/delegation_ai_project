We have to calculate how much root beer was left after all the events up to the start of the party. First, we know that Fred prepared 2,595,616 gallons, so this is our starting point. Next, Fred's children stole 595,616 gallons, leaving us with 1,999,999. Finally, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving us with 1,999,992. Altogether, this means that at the start of the party, there were 1,999,992 gallons of root beer. Dividing this amount by the number of people attending the party gives us the amount of root beer available per person.\n\nNote: The exact amount of root beer available per person depends on how many guests attend the party.

Let's assume everyone drinks the same amount. 1,998,385 gallons divided by the number of people will tell us how much root beer is available for each person. So the answer is: X gallons per person / (X gallons per person) = 1,998,385. This equation is called a system of linear equations with one variable. To solve it, we set up a table called a chart or matrix as follows:\n\n| 1   | X | 1,998,385 |\n|----|----|------------|\n|    | X |        |\n\nWe need to find the value of X that satisfies both equations simultaneously. This is called solving the system. By dividing the second column with the corresponding elements from the first column, we obtain:\n\n| 1   | X | 1,998,385 |\n|----|----|------------|\n|    | X |      1   |\n\nThis means that the values of the second column and the third column are proportional.
