We know that 4857138 people got off the bus at the first stop, and 5 times as many people got onto the bus as the number who got off. This gives us: 5*4857138 = x + 4857138, or equivalently, x = 5*4857138 - 4857138 = 9714316.

At the second stop, 21 passengers got off the bus, and 3 times fewer passengers got on than the number who got off. This means that there was one less passenger getting on at the second stop than got off at the second stop (since we're saying that it's three times fewer). Since three times fewer passengers got on than got off, the difference between those numbers is -6 (so if the number of passengers getting off at the second stop is y, then the number of passengers getting on would be y-6). Substituting this into our expression for the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop, we get: x - 21 + (-6) = x - 27. Simplifying, we get: x - 27 = x, since the number of passengers remaining on the bus didn't change from before the second stop. Therefore, the answer is: x = 9714316 - 27 = 9714289.\n\nHint 2: Alternatively, you could use algebra to find the solution. After", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
