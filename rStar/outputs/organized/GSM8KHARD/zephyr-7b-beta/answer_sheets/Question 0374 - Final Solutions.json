From Condition 3, we know that the total number of onions and potatoes they bought is 62,004,350 onions and 4 potatoes, which equals to (y + 4y) kg of onions and 4 kg of potatoes. Now we have two equations and two unknowns, and we can use them to find the values of x and y. Here's how you can solve it step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Write out the two equations:\n\nx + y = Total number of potatoes they bought\n4x + 4 = Number of potatoes Rose bought\n\nStep 2: Solve for x:\n\n4x + 4 = 4(x + y)\nSimplify:\n4x = 16y\nDivide both sides by 4:\nx = 4y\n\nStep 3: Substitute x in terms of y into the first equation:\n\nx + y = 4y", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
