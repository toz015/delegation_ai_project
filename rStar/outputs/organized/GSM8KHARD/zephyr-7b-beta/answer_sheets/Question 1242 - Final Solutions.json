John visits his parents twice a month. Let's call this 2 times per month or 2 trips per month. Each trip takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 miles per hour (mph). This distance can be found using the formula distance = rate * time. Therefore, if we divide the distance by the rate (miles/hour), we get the time taken in hours. Using the formula above, each trip takes John 2 hours to travel. Using the formula again but switching the variables around, we can find the distance travelled during each trip. Distance = rate * time. Distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles. So John travels 140 miles in total during each visit to his parents. To find out how far away his parents live, we need to know how many trips per month John makes. Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes 2 trips every month. 2 trips every month, each of length 140 miles, amounts to a monthly distance traveled of 280 miles.

We also know that John drives at a speed of 70 mph when making these trips. In order to calculate how long it would take John to travel this distance at a different speed, we first use the formula distance = rate * time to find the number of hours it takes John to travel this distance at a speed of 70 mph.

Therefore, it takes John 4 hours to travel the 280 miles when visiting his parents. Next, let's calculate the number of hours it takes John to travel 280 miles at a speed of 80 mph, using the formula distance = rate * time once again. 280 miles / 80 miles per hour = 3.5 hours. Finally, we compare the number of hours it takes John to travel the same distance at both speeds. Since it takes John fewer hours to travel 280 miles at a speed of 80 mph than at a speed of 70 mph, it follows that traveling at a speed of 80 mph is faster than traveling at a speed of 70 mph over the same distance.
