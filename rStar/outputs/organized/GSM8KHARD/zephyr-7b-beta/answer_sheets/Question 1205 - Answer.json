{"id": 1205, "problem": "Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.  One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": 2.0, "gold_answer": "2.0"}
