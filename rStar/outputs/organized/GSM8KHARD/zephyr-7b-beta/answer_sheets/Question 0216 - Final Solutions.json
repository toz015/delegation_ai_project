Condition 1: 3496756 oranges are purchased by Will. Condition 2: His two sons are instructed to wash oranges based on their ages. Condition 3: The older brother is eight years old, while the younger brother is half his age. Question: How many oranges remain uncleaned following this task assignment?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many oranges does the older son clean?", "subanswer": {"text": "To figure out how many oranges the older son cleans, we need to find out how many oranges have been purchased by Will first. Since we know that 3496756 oranges are bought by Will, let's move forward. The older brother is eight years old. Let's say his age is X, then his younger brother is X/2 years old. Since the ages of both brothers add up to eighteen, we can set it up as follows:\nX + X/2 = 18\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n2X + X = 36\nFinding the value of X:\nX(2+1) = 36\nX = 36 / (2+1)\nX = 12\nSo the age of the older brother is twelve. We know that both sons are washing oranges according to their respective ages. Therefore, the number of oranges cleaned by the older son is unknown. However, if you want to calculate it, we would need to know how many oranges Will has distributed between his sons to clean. This information is not provided in the given conditions, so we cannot determine the exact number of oranges cleaned", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Since we don't know how many oranges the older son cleans, we cannot determine how many oranges remain uncleaned following this task assignment.
