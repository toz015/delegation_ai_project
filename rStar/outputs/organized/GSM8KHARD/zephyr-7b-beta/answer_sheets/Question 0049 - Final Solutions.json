First, we have the number of girls, which we will call 'x'. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we have 2x boys. Putting these together, we have a total of (x + 2x) = 3x students. Next, we're told that there are 5 students per teacher. Using this fact, we can calculate the number of teachers needed based on the total number of students. There are 9012438 students, so the number of teachers would be 9012438 / 5 = 18024876 teachers. Putting it all together, we have three expressions: (1) the number of girls ('x'); (2) the number of boys (2x); and (3) the number of teachers (T). To find T, we use the information we're given: T = (number of students) / (number of students per teacher).
