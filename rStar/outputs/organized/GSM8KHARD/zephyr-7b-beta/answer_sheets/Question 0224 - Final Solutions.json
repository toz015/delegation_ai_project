John arm wrestled a total of 4848523 people. Out of these, he beat 0.8 or 80% of them. That's equivalent to saying he beat 80 out of every 100 people. We can calculate this as a decimal (which we get by dividing 80 by 100): 0.8. Multiplying this decimal by the total number of people gives us the number he beat: 0.8 times 4848523 equals approximately 3878818 people.\n\nNow we want to know how many people John lost to, so we can subtract the number he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled. The number he lost to is equal to the difference between the total number of people he arm wrestled and the number of people he beat: 4848523 - 3878818, which is approximately 969705 people.

To convert to an integer, you simply multiply: if we spent $10, we would expect to get back $8.00 (or 80 cents).\n\nSo let's say that John defeated 80% of the people he arm wrestled.

That's 80% of 4848523 which equals to 3878418 people. 20% remain and since they make up 20% of the original number of competitors, we know that this remaining percentage is equal to the product of 0.2 and 4848523. Let's call this value 'x'. We can write the expression as: 0.2 * 4848523 = x. Solving for x, we get: x = 9697046 (number of people who beat john).
