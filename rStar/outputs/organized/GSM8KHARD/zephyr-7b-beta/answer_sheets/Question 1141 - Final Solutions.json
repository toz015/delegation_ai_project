Summing them up, Tim will need 384 + x lemons in total. In order to determine x, we used the fact that for Allen's extra gallon, x is twice as much as the amount of lemon juice per gallon that Tim uses. Let's remember that each cup of juice requires 1 lemon, and each cup yields a lemon juice volume of 1/128th of a gallon. Thus, x can be calculated as follows: x = 2 * (number of cups for Allen's gallon) * (lemon juice volume per cup) / (gallon size). Let's say that the party had 40 people, each person drinking 2 cups of lemonade. This makes 80 cups in total, and 2/3 of those cups contain lemon juice. That means Allen's gallon of lemonade will have roughly 30% extra lemon juice than usual (twice as tart), and we know from our previous calculations that Tim's lemonade has roughly 24.75 % lemon juice. Using these facts, we can solve for the number of cups containing lemon juice for Allen's gallon using this formula: (lemon juice volume for Tim's gallon) * (number of cups in one gallon) / (percentage of lemon juice for Tim's gallon) = (lemon juice volume for Allen's gallon) * (number of cups containing lemon juice) / (percentage of lemon juice for Allen's gallon).

Since the new batch has double the tanginess, we can estimate that it will need twice as many lemons as Tim's usual recipe.

Eight lemons would therefore produce roughly half a cup (4 oz) of lemon juice. But since our measurements are based on eight-ounce cups, we'll round up to a whole cup (8 oz). Therefore, we're estimating that Allen will request a gallon with eight times the normal amount of lemon juice, which would require eight cups or 64 oz of freshly squeezed lemon juice.
