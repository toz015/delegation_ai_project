However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $8010598 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.

At venue one, it costs $200 no matter how many people come. And food will cost $8010598 per person. Let's call the number of people x.\nSo the total cost for this venue would be $200 + $8010598x.\nAt venue two, the fee for the venue itself is based on how many people come. Each person costs $28010598. If there are y people coming, the venue cost would be $28010598y. Food is already included, so we don't need to worry about that here.\nNow, if the costs are the same at both places, set them equal:\n$200 + $8010598x = $28010598y\nSince x and y are both numbers of guests, let's divide both sides by the common factor of $8010598 (for clarity):\n$25 + x = y\nTo find out how many people make it equal, we can either switch sides or calculate y in terms of x:", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
