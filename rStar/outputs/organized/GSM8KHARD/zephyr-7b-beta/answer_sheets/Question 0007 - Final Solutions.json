Firstly, let's calculate the number of downloads during the third month. Since the number of downloads decreased by 30%, we can say that the new number of downloads is 70% of the original number of downloads. Let's assume it to be 'x'. Therefore, 0.7x is the number of downloads during the third month. During the first month, we know that there were 531811 downloads. During the second month, as we calculated earlier, there were 1595433 downloads. Using all these values, we get the following formula:\n\nTotal Downloads = Downloads during first month + Downloads during second month + Downloads during third month\nTotal Downloads = 531811 + 1595433 + 0.7x\n\nNow let's substitute our value of 'x' into this equation.
