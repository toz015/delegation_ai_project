There were originally 1275 pieces (5 pies at 255 pieces each). After the guests took and ate their pieces, there were 14 pieces left. So we need to figure out how many pieces the guests took.\n\nThe tricky part here is that we don't know exactly how many guests came or how many pieces each guest took. However, we can reason as follows: Let's assume that each guest took an average of x pieces. The total number of pieces taken by all the guests would then be x * y guests = z pieces.\n\nIn order for us to find x (the number of pieces taken by each guest), we need to find x, y, and z using the information we have. Here's how:\n\n1. We know that there were 14 pieces left. We also know that these pieces were taken by the guests. So the number of pieces taken by the guests is 14 plus the number of pieces already consumed. Since there were originally 1275 pieces, the number of pieces already consumed is 1275 - 14 = 1261.

Dividing this by the number of pieces per person (255) gives us approximately 5000 people (rounded down). Since we can't divide evenly, there must be some leftover pieces which adds up to 14.
