When Andrew travels by car, it takes him half as many days. Let's find out how many days that would be. To go from New Jersey to Rochester, Andrew is traveling one way. But when he goes back home, it's a round trip. So we'll have to double the time it takes to go back. So using what we know about half as many days, let's set up an equation: x is the number of days it takes Andrew to get back from Rochester to New Jersey. Half that many days is the same amount of time it takes to go from New Jersey to Rochester. So we can say 0.5x = (x times 2) / 2, which simplifies to x = 3. Adding the days it took Andrew to get to Rochester by bus, the entire trip takes 6 + 3 = 9 days. The answer is: 9.\n\nHint 2: What is the total distance between New Jersey and Rochester? The answer is approximately 380 miles.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

It takes Andrew 6 days by bus to get to Rochester. This trip is one way. Now Andrew comes back home by car.
