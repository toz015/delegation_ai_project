We can calculate the price per apple as follows: 4 apples costs $5675900.20. That is equivalent to $1.42 per apple (rounded to two decimal places). Three oranges costs $3.30. To find out the price per orange we can divide this amount by 3: 3 oranges costs $3.30. This means that one orange costs approximately $1.10. Now that we know the price per apple and price per orange, we can calculate the total cost of 5675900 apples and 5675900 oranges. First, we calculate the total cost of all the apples: 5675900 apples will cost: $5675900.20 / apple * 5675900 apples = $8,437,500,00.
