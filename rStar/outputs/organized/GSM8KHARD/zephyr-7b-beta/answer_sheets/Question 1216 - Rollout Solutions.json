Using our answers from Question 5.1, we find that 12 slices are required for the adults, and 4 slices are required for the kids, making a total of 16 slices. Since each slice of watermelon contains some watermelon, there must be some watermelon left over. Let's call the remaining amount of watermelon X.

We also know that each child eats one slice, so the watermelon consumed by the kids is 4 * 1 = 4 units. Together, the watermelon consumed by both kids and adults is 24 + 4 = 28 units.
