Using hint 1 above, we know that the number of vacuum cleaners left over after those three rounds of sales was:\n(2/3 X - 2) * 2 = remaining vacuum cleaners\nWe're asked to find how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We know how many vacuum cleaners are left over:\nNumber left over = 9241669\nUsing this, and plugging in our expression for the number of vacuum cleaners left over into our formula for how many vacuum cleaners Melanie sold at the green house, we can solve for X, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. Here's the calculation:\nX = 3 * (9241669 + 2) / 2\nI hope that helps!", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman.

A third of Melanie's initial number of vacuum cleaners equals the number she sold at the green house. So if we let N be Melanie's starting number, we know that 1/3 of N equals the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house. We can find this value by multiplying N with 1/3. Call it X. So X is 1/3 of N. Next, Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now the number of vacuum cleaners at the green house plus the number at the red house equals the number Melanie initially had. This means that the total number of vacuum cleaners sold so far is the same as the total number Melanie initially had. So X (the number sold at the green house) plus 2 (the number sold at the red house) plus half of the remaining number of vacuum cleaners equals N. Let's call the remaining number of vacuum cleaners R. So N minus X (what was left after selling the green house vacuum cleaners) equals R (the remaining number).
