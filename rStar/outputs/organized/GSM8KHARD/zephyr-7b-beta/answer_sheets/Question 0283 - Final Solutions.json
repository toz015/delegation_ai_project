Cho travels at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour. That means in one hour, she travels 14 kilometers. To find out how far Cho traveled in all the time it took Chloe to finish hiking, we need to calculate how many hours that was. We know Chloe finished hiking after traveling for 5 hours. So let's say Cho continued hiking for those same 5 hours. That would mean she traveled for a total of 5 hours plus however many hours she took to hike before Chloe started. Let's call the number of hours Cho took to hike before Chloe started x. Now we have:\n\nCho's Total Distance Traveled = (Distance/hour) * Hours Traveled\n\nFirst, let's figure out how far Cho traveled during the first x hours. Cho traveled at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour during this time. The distance she traveled during these x hours is x * 14 kilometers per hour, or x * 14 kilometers. Next, let's figure out how far Chloe traveled during her 5 hours.
