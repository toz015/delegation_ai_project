Since every second glass costs only 60% of its price, the first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 0.6 times less than this, or $5 * 0.6 = $3. This pattern repeats itself, since every other price follows this rule. So we can use the formula P(n) = (0.6)^((n-1)/2)*5 to find out how much is the price of nth glass. Using this formula, we see that the prices of the first 5364765 glasses add up to:\n\nP(1) + P(2) + ... + P(5364765) = 5 * (1 + 0.6^0 + 0.6^2 + ... + 0.6^(1048576))\n\nUsing the fact that 1/(1-x) converges for x<1, we can calculate this sum using a geometric series:\n\nP(1) + P(2) + ... + P(5364765) = 5*(1/(1-0.6", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many glasses cost more than $5?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
