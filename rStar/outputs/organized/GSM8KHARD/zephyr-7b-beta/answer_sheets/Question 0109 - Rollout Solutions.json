We can solve for change using algebra. $1956511 - $11.73966 = change$. Simplify: $1944774.064 = change$. Since the change is in whole dollars, let's round it up to the nearest dollar. Rounding $1944774.064 to $1944775, the change is: $1944775 - $1956511 = -$11983.75 or -$1,198.38 (rounded to two decimal places).
