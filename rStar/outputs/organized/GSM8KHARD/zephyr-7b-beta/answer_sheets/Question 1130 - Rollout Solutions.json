First, let's calculate the selling price per watermelon. It costs 50 cents for each watermelon and there is a 25% profit margin.

This means that if the watermelons sell for x dollars each, the profit would be (x/100) * 50 * x. Since we want to make a profit of 25%, this works out to (25/100) * 50 * x = x/4.
