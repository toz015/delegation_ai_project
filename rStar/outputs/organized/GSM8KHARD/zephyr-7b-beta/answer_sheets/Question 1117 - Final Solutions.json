We know that the original price was $3289050 and it depreciated by 21%. To find the percentage change in price, subtract 1 from 0.21 (since percentages are decimal fractions) to get 0.79. Now we can set up an equation using the formula for compound interest. First, let P(t) represent the value or price of the car in year t. Next, let I represent the annual interest rate (depreciation rate), which is 21%. Lastly, let n represent the number of times the interest compounds per year.
