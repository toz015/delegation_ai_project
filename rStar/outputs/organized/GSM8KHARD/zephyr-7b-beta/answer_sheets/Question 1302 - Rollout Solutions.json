To find out what Patty charged for this specific repair, we need to calculate the total cost for both labor and parts. Firstly, let's calculate the cost for labor. Since the plumber spent 2.25 hours working, the cost for labor is 2.25 times $107.84, which equals $234.55. Secondly, let's calculate the cost for parts. The plumber used $60 worth of parts. This is the exact amount of parts costs we can use as it is not specified whether parts costs include taxes, if any, or any additional fees. Thirdly, we know that Patty's Plumbing charges a flat fee of $40 for visits. This flat fee is added to the total cost calculated above for both labor and parts. Therefore, the total cost for this specific repair is equal to the sum of the costs of both labor and parts, plus the flat fee for visits ($40).
