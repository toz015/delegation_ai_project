On Amazon, it is $7843414 (a really big number!). On eBay, we know that the boots still cost less, at $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon.

To compare, we could find out what the total cost would be on Amazon. Shipping costs $7843414, but remember that was just on Amazon. The total cost to buy the boots on Amazon would be $16 plus the shipping cost, which we calculated earlier. So the total cost to buy the boots on Amazon would be $16 + $7843414 = $78610358.
