Now, during the third round, each of these families calls another 4359122 families. So we want the total number of families contacted during the third round. Since we know the number of families contacted during the second round, we can calculate this by multiplying it by the number of families contacted during the third round.

Using algebra, let's write our equation: FourthRoundFamilies = FourthRoundFamilies * (FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound * 18719); now since we don't know FourthRoundFamilies, we will isolate it by dividing both sides by FourthRoundFamilies and then solving for FourthRoundFamilies. Doing this we get: 1 = (FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound * 18719) / FourthRoundFamilies; finally, by taking the inverse of both sides, we get: FourthRoundFamilies = (18719 * FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound) / 1; therefore, the exact number of families will be infinite since we cannot divide by zero. However, we can find an approximation by finding out how many families were contacted during the third round. From our previous answer, we know that: FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound = ThirdRoundFamilies / 18719. By substituting this into the formula, we get: FourthRoundFamilies = (18719 * (FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound)) / 1; now we can substitute our expression for FamiliesContactedDuringThirdRound to get: FourthRoundFamilies = (18719^2) / ThirdRoundFamilies; by doing some math and simplifying our expression, we get: FourthRoundFamilies = 36438016 / ThirdRoundFamilies. To continue, we still don't know what the number of families contacted during the third round is, but we do know that: TotalFamiliesNotified = FirstRoundFamilies + SecondRoundFamilies + ThirdRoundFamilies + FourthRoundFamilies; now since Ali called 4359122 families in the first round, we can find the rest of the families contacted during all rounds by substituting our expressions for SecondRoundFamilies, ThirdRoundFamilies, and FourthRoundFamilies into our overall expression.
