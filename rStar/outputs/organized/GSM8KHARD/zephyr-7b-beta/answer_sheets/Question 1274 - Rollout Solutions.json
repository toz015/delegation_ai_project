First, let's calculate what Nick earns per year from Job A, taking into account taxes. Salary for Job A is $12,282,200. Total tax rate is 20%. That means the tax rate on income (not including property tax) is 15%, and the remaining 5% goes towards sales tax and other miscellaneous taxes. To calculate the income tax owed, we multiply our salary times the income tax rate: $12,282,200 * .15 = $1,842,330. Now we subtract the income tax to get Nick's net pay from Job A: $12,282,200 - $1,842,330 = $10,440,870. We also need to take into account the property tax from Job B. Property tax for Job B is $6,000. Net income after property tax is our salary minus property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

First, we figure out the gross pay which is 6141110 dollars per hour times 2000 hours per year which equals to 1.23 billion dollars annually.
