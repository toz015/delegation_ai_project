Then, the amount of soup needed for dinner is 103,844,123 * y liters, which should fit inside the pot. And since the pot can hold exactly enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, then it can hold 4 * y liters or 8 * y liters of soup, depending on whether the bowls are for adults or children. However, the bowls for children contain less soup than those for adults, so we can say that y > 8y/121. Combining these, we get: 103,844,123 * y <= 4 * y or 103,844,123 * y <= 8 * y/121. These equations give us bounds for the amount of soup in each bowl, and therefore, we know that each child gets between 7.5 liters (rounded up from 7.492 liters) and 8 liters of soup for lunch.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Firstly, for dinner, each child needs 121 bowls as calculated before. That makes 8546203 children, and so each child would receive about 121 * 121.314 bowls of soup. For the leftovers, we need to convert this into litres of soup per child. We're using the same unknown amount of soup in each bowl as before. After dinner, there would still be some soup left in the pot, but we don't know how much. It could be anywhere between 4 * y litres and 8 * y litres, depending on how full the pot was when dinner started. Therefore, each child would receive some part of the remaining soup, which we calculate like this:\n\nSoup leftover / Number of bowls remaining = Soup per child\n\nNow we need to figure out how many bowls of soup remain.

Calvin's pot can fill 4 adult's bowls or 8 child's bowls. We know Calvin and his wife are adults so we only need to find how many bowls of soup the initial pot fills for adults. Since it takes 4 bowls for adults, let's divide 4 into the total number of bowls that the initial pot can fill. (The total number of bowls that the initial pot can fill is both the number of bowls it can fill for adults and the number of bowls it can fill for kids). To calculate this division, we need to use long division.

So that means, for each repetition of this process, we get 2 adult bowls and 6 child's bowls, or 8 child's bowls total (since they come in sets of 6). To find out how many times they can eat like this before running out, you want to divide the number of remaining child bowls by the number of child bowls used up at each iteration. So we calculate the number of remaining child bowls as 12 child's bowls from the initial filling, minus the 8 child's bowls we use up each time, so that's 4 child's bowls left over when we're done serving the adults. That would mean that after one iteration, we have 2 child's bowls remaining (the ones left over from the adults) plus 6 child's bowls from our calculation above, for a total of 8 child's bowls.
