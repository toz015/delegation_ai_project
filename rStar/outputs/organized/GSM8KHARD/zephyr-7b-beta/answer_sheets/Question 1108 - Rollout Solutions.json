Note that this approximation becomes less accurate for small values of x due to the fact that f(x) grows much more slowly than the linear approximation as x gets close to zero. However, as long as x is sufficiently large, the linear approximation provides a good estimate of the value of f(x). For example, if we want to approximate the value of f(10), we would get f(10)\u2248f(x)-(-4/x^3)*10, or equivalently, f(10)\u224872900", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many whole eggs does she need to make the required number of deviled egg halves for all her guests?", "subanswer": {"text": "Each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, which means they eat 0.5 whole eggs.

Lori needs 1 whole egg for every 2 deviled egg halves. So she needs 3 deviled egg halves per guest, which means she needs half an egg per guest. 1 egg is divided into 2 deviled egg halves. To find out how many whole eggs she needs for all her guests, we use this formula: number of guests times the amount of eggs needed per guest. Let's say h is the number of whole eggs she needs, g is the number of guests, and e is the number of egg halves each guest will get. 3e is the number of whole eggs she needs for the halves, since we divide an egg into two halves. So h = 3g * .5 (for 3 halves per guest) + 3g (for the whole eggs). This simplifies to: h = 1.5g. The number of whole eggs needed is 19,601,754 / 2.
