We know that tomorrow, there will be 42 adults and 6742822 babies attending the function. This means we need to find out how many chairs (both regular and high) are needed. First, let's calculate how many high chairs are required based on condition 2 and condition 3. Each high chair can replace 5 regular chairs. Since there are already 8 high chairs, we can calculate the equivalent number of regular chairs as follows: 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs that would normally be used if not replaced by high chairs. So that leaves us with (42 adults * 1 regular chair per adult) + (6742822 babies * 0.01 regular chair per baby) minus the 40 regular chairs that have been replaced by high chairs. Let's calculate this: 42 * 1 + 6742822 * 0.01 = 42 + 6742.82 = 6784.82.

How many more chairs (both regular and high) do we need? To find out, first we find out how many chairs are needed right now: 42 adults * 1 chair = 42 regular chairs needed. And since there are currently 5 regular chairs per high chair, we get 8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs. This makes a total of 42 + 40 = 82 chairs. However, we're adding more people, so we need more chairs. Since for every baby we still only have 0.01 regular chairs, we need: 6742822 * 0.01 = 6742.82 extra regular chairs needed. Step 4: Adding these up, we get a grand total of 82 chairs (already existing) plus the 6742.82 new ones, for a total of 6417.82 chairs.

Based on the hint above, we know we have 6784.82 required chairs (both regular and high) that haven't been replaced by high chairs. From hint 1, we know we have 40 regular chairs that have been replaced by high chairs. Subtracting these two numbers gives us: 6784.82 - 40 = 6744.82. Dividing this number by the number of regular chairs per adult, we get: 6744.82 / (1 regular chair per adult) = 6744.82 adults worth of chairs. But we know we have 42 adults coming. So subtracting the chairs required for the 42 adults leaves us with: 6744.82 - (42 adults * 1 regular chair per adult) = 6702.82 remaining chairs, which can be split among the remaining people.

She already has 8 high chairs and (according to condition 2) she has a ratio of 5 regular chairs to each high chair. That means she has 40 regular chairs (equivalent to 8 high chairs). So, the total number of chairs she currently has is 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs.
