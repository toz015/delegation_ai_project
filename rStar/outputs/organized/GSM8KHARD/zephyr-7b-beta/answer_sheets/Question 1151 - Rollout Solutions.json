Packing efficiency is approximately 80%, so that means that for every 100 cubic inches of space, we can pack 80 jelly beans. So if we have 270 cubic inches, we can pack:\n\n270 / 100 * 80 = 2160 jelly beans\n\nNow let's find out how many of these jelly beans are red. We know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so:\n\n30% of 2160 = 0.3 * 2160 = 648\n\nSo there are 648 red jelly beans in the jar. Tim's guess was not explicitly stated in the problem, but we'll say that Tim guessed there were 1000 red jelly beans in the jar.
