First, we find out how much a watermelon costs. Since it costs three times as much as a pepper, and each pepper costs 15$, then a watermelon costs 3 * 15$ = 45$. Next, we figure out how much each orange costs. We know that the price of an orange is five less than that of a watermelon. So, since we already found out what a watermelon costs, an orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$. Finally, we use this information to calculate how much Dillon spends. Four watermelons cost 4 * 45$ = 180$. Twenty peppers cost 20 * 15$ = 300$. And ten oranges cost 10 * 40$ = 400$. Adding up these costs, we get 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$. The answer is: 880$.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
