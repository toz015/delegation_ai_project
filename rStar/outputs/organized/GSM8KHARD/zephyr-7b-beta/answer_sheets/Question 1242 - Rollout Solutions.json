John visits his parents twice a month. Let's call this 2 times per month or 2 trips per month. Each trip takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 miles per hour (mph). This distance can be found using the formula distance = rate * time. Therefore, if we divide the distance by the rate (miles/hour), we get the time taken in hours. Using the formula above, each trip takes John 2 hours to travel. Using the formula again but switching the variables around, we can find the distance travelled during each trip. Distance = rate * time. Distance = 70 * 2 = 140 miles. So John travels 140 miles in total during each visit to his parents. To find out how far away his parents live, we need to know how many trips per month John makes. Since John visits his parents twice a month, he makes 2 trips every month. 2 trips every month, each of length 140 miles, amounts to a monthly distance traveled of 280 miles.
