Since we know that the total number of jelly beans is 5546400, let's replace all the variables with numbers.\n5. 5546400 = x + (0.99x) - (0.99x) + (1.01x), where (0.99x) is subtracted twice to account for the fact that both red and blue jelly beans were deducted from the total number of jelly beans.\n6.
