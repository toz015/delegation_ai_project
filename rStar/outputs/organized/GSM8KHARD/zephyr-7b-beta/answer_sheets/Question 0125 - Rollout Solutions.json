Let's call this 'x'. Zaid spends 1/4 of this on rent (x/4). That leaves him with (x - x/4) for car fuel and charitable donations. 1/3 of this is spent on car fuel (x - x/4)/3. This leaves him with (x - x/4 - x/12) to give to charity. Half of this is donated, leaving (x - x/4 - x/12)/2 to spend on his daughter's weekly expenses and wife's groceries and household goods. The daughter gets (x - x/4 - x/12)/2 for weekly expenses, and the wife gets the rest, which is (x - x/4 - x/12 - (x - x/4 - x/12)/2), or (x - x/8).

First, we know that zaid earns 'x'. From this, we know that zaid gives his daughter 200$ and the wife 700$, leaving him with 'x' - 900$ to spend on rent, car fuel, charity, and himself. We also know that zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is x/4. This leaves him with x - x/4 - 900$ for car fuel, charity, and personal expenses. We'll call this amount 'z'. Since zaid spends half his remaining money on charity, we get z/2 for charity. Since zaid spends 1/3 of his remaining money on car fuel, we get z/3 for car fuel. Finally, since zaid spends 'y' on himself, we can set up an equation that includes all the variables: \\begin{align*} &Zaid\\ spends\\ 1/4\\ of\\ his\\ salary\\ on\\ rent \\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ 1/4\\ Zaid's\\ Salary\\ =\\ rent\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Rent\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot x\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Y\\ =\\ x\\ -\\ Rent\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\cdot z\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot z\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Y\\ =\\ x\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot z\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Y\\ =\\ x\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{7}{12}\\right)\\cdot z\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Y\\ =\\ z\\left(1-\\frac{7}{12}\\right)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ y\\ =\\ z\\left(\\frac{5}{12}\\right)\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ z\\ =\\ \\frac{12}{5}y\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ Y\\ =\\ \\frac{12}{5}y\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ z\\ +\\ y\\ =\\ x\\ -\\ Rent\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\cdot z\\ -\\ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\cdot z\\\\ \\Rightarrow &\\ y\\ =\\ x\\ -\\ Rent\\ -\\ \\", "value": 0.25}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "From hint 2, let's say that x is Zaid's earnings.
