Since condition 3 mentions all people get one seat, we can assume each person gets exactly one drink/snack as well. Let's find out how many drinks/snacks were consumed in total. 13 people consume one drink/snack each at first. That's 13 drinks/snacks. Later, 7804773 people consume one drink/snack each too. So there are 13 + 7804773 = 7804786 drinks/snacks in total. At $2 per drink/snack, that makes $15609572 dollars spent on drinks/snacks altogether.
