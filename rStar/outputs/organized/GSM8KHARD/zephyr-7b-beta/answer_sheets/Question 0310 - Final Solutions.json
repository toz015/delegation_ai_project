Mr. Josue starts with $5619305 in capital. From the first bank, he gets $4000. From the second bank, he gets an amount twice as great. Let's call this amount X. That means Mr. Josue received $4000$ from the first bank and $2X$ from the second bank, for a total of $4000 + $2X$. This must equal Mr. Josue's current capital, which we found earlier. $4000 + 2X = 5619305$. We can find X by solving for it: $2X = 5619305 - 4000$. $X = \\frac{5619305 - 4000}{2}$.
