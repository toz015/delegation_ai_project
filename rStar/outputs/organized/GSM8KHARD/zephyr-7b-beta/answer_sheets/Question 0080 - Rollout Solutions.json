To calculate how many board feet are in all her remaining boards, we need to know how many square feet are in each board. One 2x4 board is actually 3.5 inches by 7.25 inches, so one square foot covers approximately 0.06 square inches. Therefore, since each 2x4 board is (2 * 7.25) or 14.5 square feet, we can say that it is approximately (14.5 * 0.06) or 0.87 square feet per board foot.

The old price for these boards is $7066651 divided by ten because Sasha had ten of them, so each board costs $7066651 divided by ten. So, $1.5 * ($7066651 / 10) = $1059998.15$. The total selling price would then be this amount multiplied by the quantity sold. But we don't know the exact quantity sold yet. Let's assume it's q. Then we know that the amount made is equal to the difference between the selling price and the total spent. So, the amount earned = Total selling price - Total cost. The total selling price is q * $1059998.15$, and the total cost includes what she paid for the new price of the ten 2x4s as well as the price of the five 4x4s. Since they cost her $7066651 each, it comes out to be $7066651 * (10 + 5) = $12133306$. Substituting this into our equation above: Amount earned = q * $1059998.15 - $12133306$. Simplify this expression using algebra and see what value of q will result in zero earnings. We get: Amount earned = -(q - $12133306) * $1059998.15 * (-1) * $1 = $q * $1059998.15. Since the earnings are supposed to be positive, we need to choose a value of q that makes this greater than or equal to zero. Since the earnings were supposed to be zero, that means we want the earning to be exactly $0$. Setting that expression equal to zero: $q * $1059998.15 = $0$.

This means finding out how much the new price would be if it increased by 50%. So let's say the new price is 1.5 times the old price.\n\nNow let's find out how much Sasha spent on the five 4 x 4 x 7066651 boards, since we know their prices already. That would be 5 boards times $16 per board, which comes to $80.\n\nSo how much did Sasha spend on everything? We just found out how much she spent on the 5 smaller boards, and we found out how much she spent on the ten larger boards. Adding these totals together gives us how much Sasha spent on everything. Here's the math:\n\nSasha spent $7,066,651 on the 10 larger boards. She spent $80 on the 5 smaller boards. So in total she spent $7,066,651 + $80 = $7,146,731.\n\nFinally, we want to", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
