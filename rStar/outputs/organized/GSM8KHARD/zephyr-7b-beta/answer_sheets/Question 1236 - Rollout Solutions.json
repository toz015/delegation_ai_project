During the first week, Boris produced 8,000 bars. During the second week, Boris produced 4,000 bars. And during the third week, Boris produced 24,000 bars. So the total number of bars Boris produced during those three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.\n\nWhat about the fourth week? Let's think again. We know that Boris produces 50,000 bars every month, which is 12,500 bars per week. Since Boris already produced 36,000 bars during the previous three weeks, we can find out how many bars Boris produced during the fourth week by subtracting the number of bars he produced during the previous three weeks from the total number of bars Boris produces every month. That would be: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars during the fourth week. The answer is: 14,", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
