First, we need to know how many days are in a week; most people say it is seven days, but since Jim has two activities a day, we need to divide the number of days by two. This means, he does this routine 7 divided by 2 equals 3.5 days a week. In four weeks, Jim will do this routine for 3.5 times 4, which equals 14 times. This makes 14 times 9 hours, which is 126 hours. However, since we calculated based on 3.5 days a week, we should calculate how many full weeks are in four weeks. There are 28 days in a month, and assuming there are exactly seven days in a week, this would be 4 weeks is 28 days. We know that each week has about 3.5 days worth of activity, and since this is our basis, let's see how many whole weeks this is in four weeks. Well, 3.5 times 4 is roughly 14, so we're close enough to say that there are exactly 3 whole weeks in four weeks. That makes 3 weeks times 6.5 days, or 20 days of activity. So, we need to adjust the number of hours accordingly because we counted an extra 3.5 days worth of activity, or 24 hours. So, we need to deduct 24 hours from the number of hours calculated earlier.
