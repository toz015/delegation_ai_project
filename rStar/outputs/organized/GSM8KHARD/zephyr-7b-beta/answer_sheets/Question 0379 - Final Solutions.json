The number of rounds Joe did can be calculated directly from the product of the number of rounds and the length of each round: 5423833 rounds * 3 minutes per round = 162614999 seconds. But we already know that Joe threw a total of 152537001 * 60 = 915221006 punches in one hour. Since one hour contains 60 minutes, it follows that 152537001 * 60 = 915221006 * 60 because both are the same number of punches but measured in different units: punches versus seconds. We conclude that one punch is equivalent to 0.001 seconds. Using this equivalence, we calculate how many punches Joe threw in 162614999 seconds: 162614999 seconds / 0.001 seconds per punch = 162614999000 punches.

That is, Joe threw all the punches he threw during each round (which we calculated in Question 5.1) plus all the punches he threw during the rest intervals between rounds. This rest interval is equal to 3 minutes (the length of a single round) times the total number of rounds he did (which we calculated in Question 5.2). During this interval, Joe throws zero punches, since he is taking a break! All punches thrown during the fight add up to the sum of all the punches Joe threw during each round and the zero punches thrown during the breaks between rounds. This calculation is: 457611003 punches per round times the total number of rounds (which we calculated in Question 5.2), plus zero punches during the rest intervals, equals the number of punches Joe threw during the entire fight: 457611003 punches per round * total number of rounds + zero punches during rest intervals = number of punches thrown during the entire fight. Substituting our earlier calculations into this formula, we get: 457611003 punches per round * 5423833 rounds + 0 punches during rest intervals = number of punches thrown during the entire fight.
