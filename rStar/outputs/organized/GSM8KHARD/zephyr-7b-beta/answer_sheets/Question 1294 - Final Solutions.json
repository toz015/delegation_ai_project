He spends 6 hours at the museum, making it a total time of 8 hours (6 hours spent inside the museum plus the 2 hours it took to travel to the museum). So it's been 8 hours since he left home. That means he's been gone for 8 hours (or 5:00 PM) since leaving home. Let's calculate how far away he is now. The speed of 75 miles per hour is equivalent to 120 kilometers per hour (since 1 mile equals approximately 1.6 kilometers). To determine how many kilometers he's traveled so far, we add up the distances traveled on both trips: 150 kilometers (the distance to the museum) and the distance traveled on the return trip.

We also know that he'll spend another 2 hours traveling back from the museum, meaning he'll cover another 150 kilometers during this second leg of the journey. Adding these two distances together gives us a total distance traveled of 300 kilometers.
