To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to answer 4103049% of all questions. In the first test, there are 4103049 questions, and she gets 60% of them right. That means she answered 60% of those 4103049 questions correctly. Let's call this number x. Then we know that 0.6x = 4103049 * 0.6 = 24601829. To find out the rest of the answers that she needs in the second test, we have to subtract this value from the required total. This is 4103049 - 24601829 = 16398620 questions. Let's call the number of correct answers in the second test y. We can write an equation relating these quantities as follows: 0.6x + y = 16398620.
