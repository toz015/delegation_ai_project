We still don't know what the value of B is, but since Wendy only needs to place 20 more books than twice as many books as required for filling up the entire system, it means that the remaining books required after placing those extra 20 books are still equal to half the number of additional books. In other words, Wendy needs to fill up the remainder of the shelves with B*(x*x) - (x*x)*2 - 20 books.
