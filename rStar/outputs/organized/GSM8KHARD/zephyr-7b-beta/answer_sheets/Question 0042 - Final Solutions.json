Also, we know that there are 2 sour oranges out of the remaining ones. The number of sour oranges is therefore 2. Now, what about the good oranges? Well, we don't know exactly how many there are, but we can calculate them based on what we already know. First, we add up all the oranges:\n\n6483292 = x + 0.2x + 2\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = (6483292 - 0.2x - 2)/(1 - 0.2)\n\nAnd now let's plug that into our expression for the number of good oranges:\n\nGood oranges = x - 1 - 20% of x\n\nGood oranges = ((6483292 -", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A basket contains 6483292 oranges among which 1 is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour and the rest are good.

We have 6483292 oranges, and we want to find out how many of them are good. We know that 1 is bad, so the number of bad oranges is just 1.

To get the total number of unripe oranges, we multiply this proportion by the total number of oranges. So the number of unripe oranges is 0.2 * 6483292 = 1,296,640. Next, we need to figure out how many oranges are sour. From the problem statement, we know that there are exactly 2 sour oranges.

Let's say it's just 0.01 (or 1%) of the total. So 0.01 * 6483292 = 6483. Two oranges are sour. Again, this is less than 20%. So it's roughly 0.0032 (or 0.032%) of the total. 0.0032 * 6483292 = 208.
