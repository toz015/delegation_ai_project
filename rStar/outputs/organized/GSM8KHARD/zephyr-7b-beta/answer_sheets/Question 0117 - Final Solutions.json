Sandra's neighbor gifts her with 9 eggs each time she babysits. Let's call this number 'x'.

Using the hint we found earlier, the number of eggs Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans is 117292175. Since Sandra's neighbor gifts her with 9 eggs each time she babysits, let's find how many times she needs to babysit to gather that many eggs:\n\nNumber of eggs Sandra's neighbor gives her when she babysits x times = 9 * x\n\nNumber of eggs needed to make 15 Spanish flans = Number of eggs Sandra's neighbor gives her when she babysits x times\n\n117292175 = 9", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 5}]
