So, we have:\n\nFirst plane: 3/4 * number_of_flights = number_of_flights_to_Greece\n                     X / 2               = number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany\n\nSecond plane flies exclusively to Poland. Its daily number of trips is called Y. Since the remaining trips from the first plane are shared between France and Germany, we get:\n\nX / 2               = number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany\n                    Y                      = number_of_flights_to_Poland\n\nWe also know that the total number of flights taken by both planes per day equals the number of flights made by the first plane because it goes to Greece more frequently than the second plane. Here, let's call this Z. So, we have:\n\nnumber_of_flights_to_Greece", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany / 2\n\nZ = Z\n\nNow, we can use algebra to find out how many flights the first plane takes to France in one day. We know that:\n\nFirst plane: 3/4 * number_of_flights = number_of_flights_to_Greece\n\n                       X / 2              = number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany\n\nTo solve for X, we substitute for the number_of_flights using the equation above:\n\nFirst plane: 3/4 * (X / 2) = number_of_flights_to_Greece\n\nNext, we isolate X in the equation for the number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany:\n\nX / 2              = number_of_flights_to_France_and_Germany\n\nTo find out how many flights the first plane takes to France specifically, we need to subtract the number_of_flights_to_Germany from X:\n\nnumber", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
