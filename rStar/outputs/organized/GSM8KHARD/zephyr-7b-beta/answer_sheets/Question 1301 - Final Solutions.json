Since James' bike time is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, we can find this by adding 5 minutes to Jon's bike time. So James' bike time is 1 hour and 25 minutes.\n\nWe also know that James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. This means that James took 90% as long as Jon to complete the swim. In other words, James' swim time was 0.9 times Jon's swim time. Let's call Jon's swim time x again.

James swims 10% faster than Jon, so we can say his swimming speed is 1.1 times Jon's swimming speed. Let's call Jon's swimming speed s. This means James' swimming speed is 1.1s. We know Jon takes 40 minutes to swim the distance d. Using our hint, Jon's speed is s meters per minute. Therefore, James' speed is 1.1s meters per minute. To cover the same distance, James will take 40 * (1.1s) / s minutes. This gives us James' swimming time: 40 * (1.1s) / s minutes. Next, we calculate James' biking speed using condition 2. James' bike time is one minute longer than Jon's bike time. Since Jon takes 1 hour and 20 minutes to bike, James' bike time is 1 hour and 25 minutes. This translates to 60 + 5 = 65 minutes, or 1 hour and 5 minutes. Using our hint from earlier, we can calculate James' biking speed in meters", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
