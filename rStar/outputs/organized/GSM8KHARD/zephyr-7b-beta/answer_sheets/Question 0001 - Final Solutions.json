That makes a total of 2287720 + 2x bolts.\n\nSince we know that the robe needs half as many white bolts as blue, we can substitute 2x into our expression for the number of bolts required for white. That is, we know that the robe needs 2x/2, which simplifies to x, bolts of white fiber. When we substitute this value back into the expression for the total number of bolts required, we get:\n\nTotal Bolts Required = 2287720 + x\n\nNow, we want to minimize the total number of bolts required. We can achieve this by finding the smallest possible value for x. This will result in the minimum overall number of bolts required. To find the minimum value of x, we can use algebra to solve for x in terms of the total number of bolts required.

It also requires half as many bolts of white fiber, which is 1143860. The total number of bolts required is the sum of the bolts required for blue and white fiber. That's 2287720 bolts for blue and 1143860 bolts for white, so we can find the total by adding them up: 2287720 + 1143860 = 3431580. The answer is: 3431580.\n\nHint 2: What percentage of the bolts needed for a single robe comes from white fiber? We can figure this out by finding out how many bolts of white fiber we need for one robe, and dividing it by the total number of bolts needed for one robe.
