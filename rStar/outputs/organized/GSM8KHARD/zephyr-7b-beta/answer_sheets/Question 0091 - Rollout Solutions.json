We know that 500 patients visit the hospital daily. Each patient spends 24 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes for all patients together. So, the total time taken by all patients to be treated is 1440 minutes. We also know that the hospitals charges the doctors $6914510/hour and the patients $200/hour. Let's assume that the hospital charges doctors for only the portion of time they spend treating patients (other times such as meetings etc. Are not charged). This would mean that for every dollar that the hospital earns from the patients, it pays $x$ to the doctors. Let's find out what value of 'x' works here.
