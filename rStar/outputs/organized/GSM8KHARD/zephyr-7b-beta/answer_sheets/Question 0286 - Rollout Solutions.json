This means that the number of girls equals half the total number of members. In symbols, let x be the total number of members; then 50% of x is the number of girls. So 0.5x = x / 2 = the number of girls. Solving for x gives us x = 2(0.5x) = 1 female member is worth 2 people (including herself), so the number of girls is 1 girl is worth 2 people (including herself). Solve for x gives us x = 12 * 2 = 24 people (including all the girls). Since we also have that there are 77836 people in total, we get that the number of boys is found by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of members: the number of boys is 77836 - 24 = 77812 boys.

This means that the number of people who actually sang is half of the remaining performers, since the choir's 3 teachers still sang. Using our calculations from the previous questions, we see that there are 24 girls and 77812 boys in the choir. The number of performers before the bus broke down is given by adding the number of girls and boys together: y = x + y/2 = 24 + 38906 = 38930. Half of these performers couldn't make it due to the broken bus, leaving a remaining number of performers: r = (1/2) * 38930 = 19465. Of these, three teachers also sang. This gives us the total number of people who sang: r + 3 = 19468. Solving for r gives us r = 19468 - 3 = 19465, which we computed earlier.
