The first equation represents James running 12 miles at 10 miles per hour for one day. The second equation represents James running the total number of miles for the whole week.

We know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To calculate how long it takes him to cover 12 miles, use the formula: time (in hours) = distance (in miles) / speed (in miles per hour). Time taken by James to complete 12 miles = 12 miles / 10 miles per hour = 1.2 hours (equivalent to 72 minutes).
