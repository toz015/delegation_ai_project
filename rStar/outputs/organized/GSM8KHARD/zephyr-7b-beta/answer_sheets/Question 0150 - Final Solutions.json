Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, the weight of all the chocolate bars is 109878 * 40 = 439515200g. Since each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, each one weighs 20g. The weight of all the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 16000g. Adding this to the weight of the chocolate bars gives us the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, which is 439515200g + 16000g = 455515200g. The answer is: 455515200.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
