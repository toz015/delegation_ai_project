Janet spent $500 on materials for the brooch (condition 1). She spent an additional $4358988 for construction (condition 2). To find out how much she spent on insurance (condition 3), we know it is 10% of the cost of construction plus the cost of materials and construction. 10% is 0.10. Let's call the cost of construction C. So 0.1C is the cost of insurance. To find the total cost, we add up all three costs. $500 + $4358988 + 0.1C is the total cost. So we can set this up as an equation: T = 500 + 4358988 + 0.1C. We don't yet know what C is, so we can't solve for T exactly. However, we can use our knowledge that 0.1C is equal to the cost of insurance to find another equation involving C. 10% of C is 0.1C.
