{"id": 455, "problem": "Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.\nHe has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.\nEach bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.\nEach bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.\n#### 1920", "gold_answer": "1920"}
