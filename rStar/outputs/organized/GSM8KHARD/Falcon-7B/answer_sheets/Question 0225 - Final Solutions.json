To figure out the distance he travels, let's first identify the distance from New Jersey to Rochester. The distance from New Jersey to Rochester is 280 miles. To get the distance from Rochester to New Jersey by car, we need to divide the distance by two. The distance is 140 miles. Therefore, Andrew travels 140 miles each day by car.\n\nThe total distance of the road trip is 280 miles + 140 miles = 420 miles.\n\nAndrew travels 6 days, so he traveled 420 miles in 6 days.\n\nSo, the final answer is: 420 miles.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester.
