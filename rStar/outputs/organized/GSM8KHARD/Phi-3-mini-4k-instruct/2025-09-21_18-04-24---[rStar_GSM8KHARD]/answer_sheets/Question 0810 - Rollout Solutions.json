Firstly establishing base values which can serve throughout all analysis; since we don't possess details about Brian's initial speed nor specific distances covered initially yet knowing only cumulative totals over seven straight periods doesn't suffice due to potential fluctuations/variabilities during transitions from weekend to workdays etc., instead direct application could yield erroneous results but indirect approach helps circumvent said pitfalls while staying within bounds established thus far Let us denote S(i) being Sarah's chosen pathway length corresponding to i+1th period & B representing its counterpart herewith assumed constant henceforth except noted exceptions Taking note into account rule dictated stipulates doubling effect upon subsequent interval so effectively reducing countable instances accordingly under consideration yields N=Todays Distance*log_2(N)+C Wherein C stands denoting additive compens", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
