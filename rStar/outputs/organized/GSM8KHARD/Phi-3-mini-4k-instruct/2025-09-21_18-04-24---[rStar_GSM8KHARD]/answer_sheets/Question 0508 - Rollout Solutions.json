From the earlier problems, it was established that Gissela could carry 4000 pounds while Gordy carries 800 pound more than what Gissela carried which amounts to 4800 pounds respectively. As per the last statement; When all their cargo comes together, the three trips summed would amount to precisely 11600lbs. Thus if you subtract both Gisselas and Gorods totals i.e., 4000+4800=8800from this grand cumulative weight of 11600lb, It leaves us just under but equaling exactly ten times lesser around seventeen hundred sixteen pounds ((11600-(8800))/10). This implies that every time Gary drives down alone carrying our entirety its equivalent over four folds or simply put 'four'.
