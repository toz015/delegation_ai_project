Firstly, we need to determine the number of rodents in each type of cage. We know that half of the cages have 10 hamsters each and the other half have 5 guinea pigs each. Since there are 6 cages, it means there are 3 cages with hamsters and 3 cages with guinea pigs.\n\nFor the hamsters, you multiply the number of these cages (which is 3) by the number of hamsters in them (which is 10). This gives us 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters. Similarly, for the guinea pigs, since there are also three cages containing them but only holding 5 guinea pigs each, you calculate 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.\n\nFinally, add together both totals; so the combined count of hamsters and guinea pigs equals 30 + 15 = 45 rods.
