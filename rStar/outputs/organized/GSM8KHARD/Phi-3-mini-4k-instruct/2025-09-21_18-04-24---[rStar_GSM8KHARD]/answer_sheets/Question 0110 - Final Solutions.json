Then she gathered thrice as many roses compared to the sum of violets and pansies but lost ten fragrant lilacs when moving boxes. How many floral bouquets could Lily make if each contains nineteen different species including rosemary not counted among those mentioned earlier? Answer first using clear stepwise calculations then condense your final explanation without resorting to numerical values, focusing purely on process articulation. Step 1: Let B represent the number of Bluebell plants. Since violets exceed bluebells sevenfold, Violet count is V = 7B. Pansies being quantified relative to violets yields Pansey tally as Pe = V - 5. Roses outnumber collective violet-pansy sums tripling hence Roots rerounded equals R = 3(V+Pe).

below calculation based on animal year requirements converted into twelve-month intervals since we consider 'six-month followup'. Thus :  \nFor every single kind of animal considered , divide its stated annual sum by half(since it represents about 6 months). Herein lies our primary computation stage .   \nMonkey Banana Needs (per Year):     \n       Given Value=    200 ; Timeframe=(Year*Half)=       200*(1)*(1/2)=        100 bananas /half_year           ...
