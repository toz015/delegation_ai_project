We start off knowing we have 6,394,177 candies since Oscar starts having them. First thing which happened was him eating 2 candy while going to school so subtract those first : 6,394,177 - 2 = 6,394,175 (now) . Next up ,he passed out one fourteen or multiplied their friend count(friends=14). This means adding/subtracting based upon whether you add (+)=give away(-)=get back depending if your result would increase or decrease respectively. Since here our goal wants us getting fewer than what we initially beganwith its thus subtraction not addition hence;  6,394,175 - 14*2 =>   6,394,175 -28 ===> 6,394,147 remaining_candies..Next part involves doubling the amount obtained via previous action(multiply)(i.e.(x)*2);meaning taking whatever value came forth beforehand & making double because 'twice'", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Oscar has 6394177 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.

Later he shared these among his peers reducing the count further by 14 leaving him with (6394175 - 14 )= 6394161 candies. At evening when coming back, his mother gifted him double what he distributed earlier i.e., 2*14 equalling 28 extra sweets raising his stockpile upwards to (6394161+ 28) = 6394189 sweet treats. Consuming three additional ones while heading home reduces the collection down again by another sum namely 3 hence bringing us finally to ((6394189 \u2013 3) or simply put, 6394186 candy stashes.)
