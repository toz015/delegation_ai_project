Over a 30 day month, this means driving 100 * 30 = 3000 miles. Since his car needs a tune up every 1000 miles, it would require one complete set within those three thousand miles driven during the entire month (as 3000 / 1000 equals exactly 3). Therefore, assuming no additional mileage beyond what was stated, he only requires 3 tune ups over the course of these thirty days.
