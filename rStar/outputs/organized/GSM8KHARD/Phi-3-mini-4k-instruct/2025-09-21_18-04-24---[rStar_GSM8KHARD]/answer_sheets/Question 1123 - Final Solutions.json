You already calculated correctly that about 1,654,679 fish have red stripes since we take exactly one third out of all the fish present because only these ones could possibly also fall into another category such as having both colors (red & blue).\n\nNow let us find out how many fish don't possess any kind of striping pattern i.e., neither red nor blue. This can simply obtained through subtracting the count representing fish sporting just red patterns: Total Fish Number \u2013 Red Striped Fish Count. That results into 4,964,038-(~=1,654,679), leaving ~=3,309,359 nonstriped specimens within the aquarium. Hereafter comes our next calculation stage: determining what quantity among them showcases signs of carrying either a single color or double shades like Blue along with Red.
