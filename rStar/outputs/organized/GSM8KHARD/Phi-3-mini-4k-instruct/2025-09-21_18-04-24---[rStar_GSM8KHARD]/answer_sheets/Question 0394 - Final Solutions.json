Condition 1:  First book - 31mm thick. Second book - 50mm thick. Third book (conditional) - must measure exactly 5mm thinner than the second book; hence it would also require calculating its thickness based on this condition before adding up totals. Fourth book (conditional) - needs calculation since its measurement depends directly upon being \"twice\" the thickness of another item described earlier (in fact, double the height of something else). We can then compute each individual dimension given those constraints and sum them altogether once we know precisely what dimensions apply where. So far so good!
