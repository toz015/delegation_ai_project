Given that Vanessa supposedly matches up against Aaron's capabilities despite potential disadvantages due to different speeds/distances, you calculated it incorrectly using just basic arithmetic operations without considering possible differences in conditions affecting them like weather etc.; however even accounting these factors wouldn't change your initial calculation significantly because distances traveled remain constant among various scenarios unless explicitly mentioned thereby rendering irrelevant any speculative modifications stemming solely off those influences outside scope determined previously hereinbefore addressed accordingly ensuring consistency remains maintained alongside integrity preserved whilst providing logical explanations wherever applicable ultimately reinforcing reasoning behind determining said figure reliably groundedly firm & accurate!
