How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "First calculate the number of bananas consumed per day by all the monkeys combined. Since they consume food equivalent to one whole bunch daily (which contains N bananas), then what would be their consumption rate expressed numerically without using any units or symbols other than digits?.", "subanswer": {"text": "We know that together, the three monkeys eat an entire bunch (N) every single day. Let x represent the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey; thus, since the problem states that 'one monkey eats ten bananas,' you should input **x=10** . This implies that Monkey B consumes ***(x+4)=10+(4*1)**** = **14** , according to our variable substitution rules above.* And finally , let y equal the quantity fed to the last monkey ; therefore , if we add up everything else mentioned earlier : ***y=(N)-(x)+(x+4)*****(or)(N-(10))+(14). From here outwards , substitute values from your initial definitions whenever possible . Then move terms across brackets accordingly until solving becomes easier -- ultimately resulting in finding Z! In general case however , use PEMDAS orderly approach instead ! Hence final formula will appear like below :-   **Z=[(((N)-(X+Y)))/(PQRSTUVWXYZ)]** Whereas X stands against its own letter counterpart Y shares same positional importance beside itself along w/ others but differs due name change etc ..
