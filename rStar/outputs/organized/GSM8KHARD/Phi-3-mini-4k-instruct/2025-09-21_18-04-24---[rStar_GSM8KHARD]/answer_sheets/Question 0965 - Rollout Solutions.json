Condition 2: The actual count of students without desktops totals 6,368,957. To find the overall number of students, we must determine what value multiplied by four equals or surpasses 6,368,957 since only one part represents those lacking desktops while the other parts represent those who possess them; thus, the complete set includes both segments equally represented within it.
