Since one serving represents twice the individual usage rate mentioned under condition 1 (wherein \\(0.2 kg\\) was used), a single unit equals half of \\(0.2 kg\\), i.e., \\(0.1 kg\\). Multiplying this value times three instances throughout the day (lunch and two dinners) equates to \\(0.3 kg\\) per person every twentyfour hours (\\(0.1 kg \\cdot 3=0.3 kg\\)).
