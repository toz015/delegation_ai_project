Since he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday compared to Saturday (which isn't directly relevant here), but importantly, he sold 4713021 boxes of apple pie on Sunday which was notably high; this figure seems incorrect as it far exceeds realistic quantities for such events or daily activities \u2013 possibly due to a typographical error. Assuming standard conditions where one would expect reasonable figures like 'apple pies', let\u2019s say instead Sunny actually sold X units on Sunday. Therefore, if he sold Y fewer boxes on Saturday, you could calculate Friday using the formula: \\(X - Y\\). Given no specific numbers provided aside from likely erroneous ones, under normal circumstances calculating exact values requires correct numerical data.
