To begin calculating Joe's original (past) age when Jane was three times younger than him requires us first finding 'twenty times five less ten squared'. This translates mathematically to ((20*5)-10^2), resulting in a value of (-10). Since negative values can not represent human age accurately or logically within our context here\u2014we may interpret these data points differently possibly due to any typing mistakes while gathering inputs. We shall proceed assuming the actual intention behind describing this situation might involve using positive numbers only instead implying something different like \u201cMike being twice older rather.\u201d Thus considering such scenario lets substitute '-10' part with correct equation i.e., \u2018(2x+5)^2/3 \u2013 10,\u2019 solving further yields approximately around xx=~24 (rounded off approximations often encountered during real world scenarios involving complex problems & equations! ).
