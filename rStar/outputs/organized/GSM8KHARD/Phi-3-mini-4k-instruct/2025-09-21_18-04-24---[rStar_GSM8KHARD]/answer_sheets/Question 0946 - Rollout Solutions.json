According to hint 2 (condition 2), you want to cover three times as large which comes to about 600 feet (double the original amount) plus another double since its mentioned 'triple'. This means you actually require around 600+600= 1200 feet instead. You also mention that right now you possess additional support materials measuring approximately 6 feet. However, your task clearly states requiring enough extension so the repaired line covers precisely ten folds larger than the existent installation size. To conclude, deductible consideration includes no provision for spare lengths nor discrepancies caused by estimation errors whilst determining quantities intended usage scenarios presented earlier. Therefore subtraction operation performed shall eliminate unwanted parts leaving us exactly remaining thread demand excluding reserve allocations alongwith presupposed margin factors possibly introduced erroneously into calculation phase owing improper understanding concerning fundamental core principles governing overall situation dynamics involving involved entities & respective roles assigned thereto relative specific functional areas pertinent directly influencing decisions made regarding critical junctures encountered subsequently unfolding events ultimately culminating achieving ultimate", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
