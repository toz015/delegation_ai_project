Doubling these amounts gives us 4 slices. Adding the extra 8647390 slices brings the total to 8647394 slices. Tripling this amount results in 25942182 slices remaining. From here, deducting the 2 slices used personally reduces it to 25942180. Lastly, if 5 slices are taken away because friends take them, you would end up with 25942175 slices remaining.
