Since he earns $2 profit per saleable product/doughnut sold, this implies that derrick can accumulate roughly a sum equaling sales multiplied by price earned per item as follows: Therefore, Derrick could potentially generate revenue close to 3600*2= <<3600*2=7200>>$7200 over the course of the entirety of June provided that no excess stock goes unsold..
