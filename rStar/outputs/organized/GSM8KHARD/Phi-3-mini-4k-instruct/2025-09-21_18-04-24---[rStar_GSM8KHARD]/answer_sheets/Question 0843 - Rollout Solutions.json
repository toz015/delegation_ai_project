We first start calculating the area covered by beds which came out to be exactly 960 Sq Ft according to my previous solution hence we can safely ignore it while considering other components too since these numbers won't change irrespective of order used. Next thing mentioned was : **\"living room IS THREE TIME THE ROOM SIZE OF ONE BEDROOM\"**. When I took average single unit/bedroom dimension to formulate equation initially its result could vary either way depending upon whether you decide starting point based on length OR width so doing same again makes sense albeit little confusing however reiterating formula below ; \n\nX*Y = [((LEN)*WID)/COLS]*([(WIDTH)*HEIGHT]/ROWS); //where LENS refers tothe largest sidelengthofthe smallestunitarea consideredforthisquestionand WIDTHreferstothesmallestdimensionconsideredherewhilecalculatingsomeaveragevalueetc.;//also HEY HELL MATRIARCH!!!HOWDOUSBOTHERWISE DIVIDEDISTINCTLYIFONESTARTSWITHCOL", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
