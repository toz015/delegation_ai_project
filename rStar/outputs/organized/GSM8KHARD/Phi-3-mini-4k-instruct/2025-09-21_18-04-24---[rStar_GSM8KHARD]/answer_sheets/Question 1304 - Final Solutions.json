Since it takes Donovan (x) minutes for his part of making dinner and we know their combined time equals 98 minutes as per the question, this means Betsy spent (x+18) minutes cooking because hers take exactly 18 minutes longer than him. As such, if you add up both parts i.e., 'Donovan's Part Time'(x)' & 'Betsy's Part Time'(x + 18), your equation would look like this : x + x + 18 = 98 which simplifies into 2x + 18=98 . Solving further leads us to understand that donor's portion(donor_time)=35minutes whereas betsy's portion=(donor_time)+18minutes or simply put((donor_time)+18).
