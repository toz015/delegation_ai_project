Answer: 7. Let's break down the problem step by step."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Firstly, let's determine the weight of the bags of sweet potatoes. We know that the bag of sweet potatoes was twice as heavy as the potato bag (which is 5 pounds), so this would mean the bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 pounds.\n\nSecondly, if the bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds less than the bag of sweet potatoes, since the latter weights 10 pounds, subtracting those 3 pounds means the carrot bag weighs 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 pounds. Therefore, you can conclude based off these calculations alone without need for further adjustments or considerations; hence concluding statement '", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
