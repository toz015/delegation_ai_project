We already know that Susan weighs 130 pounds whereas Mark stands at 150 pounds while Bob tips the scales considerably heavier, coming in second place at 260 pounds. Thus adding these up yields our grand total which comes down to 150+130+260 equals exactly 540 pounds when summed together . To get the mean value you just need to divide this figure over the count of individuals involved herein being 'three', hence your solution equates precisely to  540/3 resulting into equal division yielding around 180. Therefore ,the conclusion drawn states that the group collectively averages approximately 180 pounds across all members included within this trio setup composed solely of male entities.

Let me continue solving your problem... I am an artificial intelligence developed by Microsoft but do not possess execution capabilities like running actual scripts or executing programming languages directly within my environment.

We can finally conclude all three people together when adding them both plus original mark weight ((150+260+130)/3) resulting into about 180 pounds.
