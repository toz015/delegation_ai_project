Initially, Ezra reads 6540573 / 2 = 3270286.5 ~= 3270286 when rounded down because you can't really split or take part of a book into halves practically speaking unless talking about digital copies being downloaded etc., hence assuming whole numbers here. But ahmed would still need half i.e.: 3270286 / 2 = 1635143 approximately matching up closely enough due to rounding errors earlier accounting for full integer values only.

This means that Ahmed read half as much because it was mentioned earlier that Ezra reads two times as many books as Ahmed. Therefore, Ahmed read (6540573/2) which equals approximately 3270286.5 books rounded down since we cannot count parts of a book. Hence, together, they would initially have read about (6540573+3270286)=9810859 books before Ezra decides to add another 150 books making their new grand tally around 9810859+150=9811009. However rounding off doesn\u2019t apply here so the most accurate number without fractions or decimal points based on whole numbers reading habits can be found out first then added up further. For simplicity, let us ignore those .5 extra from division for now till end calculations thus keeping both values same but adjust at last when all sums made sense through calculation.
