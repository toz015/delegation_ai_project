Therefore irrespective of number of weeks worked if john continues this habit then even at end of one year or ten years when compared against his entirety of annual salary that\u2019d still yield just about same amount saved(around $80), due mainly because of its very low value relative to overall wage thus making effective 'week based' calculation impractical .
