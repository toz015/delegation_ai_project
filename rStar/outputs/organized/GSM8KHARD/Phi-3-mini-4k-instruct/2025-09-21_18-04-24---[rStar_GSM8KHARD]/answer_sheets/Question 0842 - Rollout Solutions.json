We know half of the mural is yellow so we can divide out this amount first; 275496 / 2=137748 . That means one color uses up twice as much (red) than another(yellow). Let R represent Red , W represents White, P represents Purple, Yellow gets represented simply by its value which would be divided into third parts since three other colours share evenly amongst them. Meaning if you combined their values together equally it equals double what yellow alone holds due to our previous deduction about it being only half overall. This leads us down following path : ((R+W)+P)*Y/3*2=.
