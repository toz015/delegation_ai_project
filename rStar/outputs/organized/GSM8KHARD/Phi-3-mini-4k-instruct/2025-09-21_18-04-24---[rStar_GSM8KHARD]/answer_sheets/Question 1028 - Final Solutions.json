We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute, therefore compute $\\frac{1,262,795}{60}$ equals approx. 21,046.58 blinks per second.

From here, knowing these averages allow us to estimate times using basic division operations. We know initially at t(0), all blinking action begins happening simultaneously.
