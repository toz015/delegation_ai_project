Conditions 3 & 4 (implicit): To calculate this increased value amount (\\( I \\)), you use Equation C = P_i * Markup Ratio; where 'P_i' stands for initial product cost ($696747) and 'Markup Ratio' corresponds to Fraction B (\\( \\frac{11}{8} \\)). Finally, Profit can be computed using Formula D=Sale Price - Cost Price or Proft Calculation Rule E = Sale Amount \u2013 Acquisition Expenditure considering both terms as monetary values expressed in USD currency units. Using given data Point M ('\\$'), perform calculations following established steps F through H sequentially without deviation until reaching final solution point G'. Display results neatly formatted ensuring clarity throughout computational process adherence while maintaining rigorous financial accuracy standards.\" Solution: First we find the markups made on sales which equals Product i*Fraction b. So it becomes \\$696747 * \\(\\frac{11}{8}\\) = \\$927214. Next step involves calculating profits via formula rule g.'

Since Percentage increase should always remain positive, therefore taking modulo operation : Mod(-x)=Mod(x). Hence, %. Answer is approximately %70 rounded off to nearest whole numbers for simplicity sake since fractions cannot exist in practical scenarios like business dealings.
