Third aspect mentioned hints about halving orange quantity compared to original count implying reduced figure i.e., divided equally among them resulting in subtotal of approximately around  997067 Oranges if taken average due rounding off involved herewith keeping fair representation intact without excessive precision loss during division operation itself so overall summing up these figures across respective donors yields collectively rounded combined summation equalling closely approximated approximate integer value equal(\u2248 )\u2009to ten thousand seven hundred twenty four units namely ,apple+orange=Total_Fruit .

Step 2: Create diagrams showing these possibilities using Venn Diagrams/Flowcharts which visually represent different scenarios based off certain events happening together vs individually affecting one another etc... This helps us understand whether something happens because we expect its occurrence due solely upon meeting initial criteria OR perhaps multiple variables come into play before any action occurs finally culminating towards desired results despite contrary belief at first glance!
