Firstly, we determine the daily consumption which equates to 1 serving of ice cream (as stated). Over 60 days this becomes 1 * 60 = <<1*60=60>>60 servings required. Since these come packaged in sets or batches of 15 servings within a single container/carton, you need 60 divided by 15 equaling exactly 4 containers of ice cream over those three weeks period. Lastly calculating out their cumulative price using multiplication across all units i.e., Four times ($4571604) equals $<<4*4571604=18286416>>18286416 spent overall during said duration considering no changes like discount rates etc. Therefore, putting everything together results in conclusion statement \u2013 'After purchasing enough supplies to sustain herself through thirty consecutive evenings without any replenishment, Cynthia incurs expenses amounting to approximately eight million six hundred twenty thousand seven hundred sixty-four US Dollars'.
