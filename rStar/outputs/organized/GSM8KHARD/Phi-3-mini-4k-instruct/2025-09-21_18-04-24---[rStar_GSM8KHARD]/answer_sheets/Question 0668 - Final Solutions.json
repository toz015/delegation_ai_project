We already established that Farmer Brown has 200 acres. According to the hint given, To get the amount owned by Farmer Smith, first multiply 2 times the size of Farmer Brown's field (+ 100). Therefore calculating such multiplication provides us [(2*200)+100]=500 acres representing the space occupied initially by Farmer Smitty. Combining the areas belonging to both growers equates simply requires summating said individual spaces leading thus to ->totalarea=[farbmorrowsproperty]+[farmsmittyland],which when translated algebraicistically reads->totalarea=200acre+500acre..Performing basic computation brings forth a combined overall agrarian possession measuring approximately 700 acres altogether...
