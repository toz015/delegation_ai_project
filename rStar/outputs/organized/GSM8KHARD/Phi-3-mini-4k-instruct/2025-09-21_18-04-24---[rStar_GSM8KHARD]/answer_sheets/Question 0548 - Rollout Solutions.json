However following through subsequent calculations may require reintroducing certain initial factors depending largely on whether said operations affect counts towards something else other than itself ie.; only considering original quantities initially counted doesn\u2019t necessarily hold true henceforward especially when performing such mathematical manipulations regarding objects whose nature remains consistent across changes yet having varied denominations attached differently during different phases due to contextual variations throughout proceedings involved..
