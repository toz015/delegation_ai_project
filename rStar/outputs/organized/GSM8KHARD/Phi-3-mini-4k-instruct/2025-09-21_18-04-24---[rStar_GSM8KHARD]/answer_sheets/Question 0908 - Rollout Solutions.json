Considering optimum scenario, let\u2019s assume maximum possible increase which results in highest Speech Rate(SR) being equal to Page Count/Time needed . We know page count refers to Total Number Of Pages multiplied by Individual Word Per Page. Given these numbers , our equation becomes SR=(Total No.OfPages)*IndividualWordPerPage / TimeNeededToSpeakThisContentInMinutesWe rearrange terms above into the formula required below : Time Needed To Articulate This Content During Deliveryin Minutes=((TotalNo.ofpages) * IndividualWordPerPage)/MaximumPossibleSpeechRateAssuming Optimal Performance Maximum Possible Speed Here Is What That Sounds Like Based Off Our CalculationsAnd Using These Formulas And", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.
