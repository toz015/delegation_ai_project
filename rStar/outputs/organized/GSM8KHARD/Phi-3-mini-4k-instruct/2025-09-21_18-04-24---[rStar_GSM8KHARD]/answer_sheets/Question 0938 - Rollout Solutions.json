Over two weeks, this becomes 5 days/week * 2 weeks = 10 workdays. Next, we need to find out the daily earnings: With service rates being constant throughout these ten working days regardless of whether it\u2019s just one day or multiple days within those same period\u2014since no fluctuation was mentioned regarding variable pricing due to demand changes over time nor any mention about special discount offers during peak hours--we can directly multiply our initial amount of serviced cars times their individual rate ($4).
