Strings Time : Number Of Racquets / Speed Per String * SyntheticGutStringTimePerRacket =>   3/1*15=>45mins\nPolyester Strings Time : NumberOfRacquets /Speedperstring * PolyesterStringsTimePerRacket =>  5/1*22=<<5/1*22=110>>110mins\nHybrid Sets Time :Numberofracquets/speedperstring * HybridSetTimesecretionperracket =>    6/1*18=>108 mins\nNext adding these timings, We get Total Timings ;
