Condition 1:  Janet spends $500 on making components for a brooch. Condition 2: She hires a jeweler who charges an amount represented as X (X being equal to 4358988) for crafting the piece. Condition 3: The value paid represents only part of what was spent; specifically, this portion amounts to exactly one fifth of the initial sum including both manufacturing costs ($Y + Z). Here Y = $500 representing the raw component expense while Z denotes the charge imposed by the artisan. To calculate W which stands for the entire payment made, we use equation W=Z+Y*(6/5), whereby substituting known values gives us - $$W=\\$500+(6*\\frac{4358988}{5})=\\$$4700472 Hence adding up both parts reveals the final price inclusive of any potential tax or fees charged hence $$\\boxed{\\$4700472}$$ Thus concluding our solution.
