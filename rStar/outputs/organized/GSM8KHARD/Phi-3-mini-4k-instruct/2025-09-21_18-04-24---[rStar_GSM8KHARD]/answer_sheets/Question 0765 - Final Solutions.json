First off, we need to calculate the increase amount caused by the incident using the initial cost as our baseline ($6,097,770).

Adding this incremental charge onto the foundational figure gets us into closer proximity towards determining present payments under these new parameters: modified_cost = basic_annual_expense + extra payment equals roughly $9,756,432. Therefore your updated estimated annual obligation post-accident stands around or about $9,756,432.
