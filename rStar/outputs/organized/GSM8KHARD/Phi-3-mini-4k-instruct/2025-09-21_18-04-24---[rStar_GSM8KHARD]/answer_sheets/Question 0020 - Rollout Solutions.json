We know that the sum of these prices equals five thousand plus fifteen hundred thirty-three minus three hundred thirteen (or simply twelve forty eight), or twenty seven seventy nine cents ((15+15)*x = 27*x=2779). Thus, dividing eleven ninety sixty nines by eighteen points yields an approximate quotient of ten point something zero fifty nine (x=(2779/11)/(18)). Multiplying such quantity times itself results in approximately .956 billion (.956 million divided by one mil). Subtracted off another billion would leave about sixty nine millions $(10^9-.956*10^9). Rounded off to nearest integer will give us nearly \"$1\" hence our solution. Answer:(($1)+$2)=$3 Explanation : One type of expensive footwear sells separately but cheaper versions exist too ; now gloria wants those 'expensive ones'. She decides not purchase any since they all exceed even hers limited expenditure capacity! But why do people like fancy things anyway ?
