Here's a simplified explanation:\n\nWhen most adults require glasses, it usually indicates some level of myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism, or other focusing issues which result in blurred vision either near or far away depending on the type of issue. Glasses work by modifying light paths onto the retina \u2013 essentially moving your point of clear sight back to its original location according to necessity. However, this modification doesn't significantly distort overall dimensions aside from close reading tasks requiring distinct magnification levels often offered through bifocal/progressive lenses.\n\nSo theoretically speaking \u2014as long as appropriate power & design exists\u2013we can assume slight variances could indeed develop over time concerning judgement accuracy especially around proximity estimations i.e., gauging how 'close' something appears vs being true distant positions concurrently .

Consideration should begin by acknowledging the average human vertical field of view and binocular overlap\u2014commonly referred to as Panum's fusional area\u2014which allows individuals to merge images from both eyes resulting in single coherent views despite small differences in perspective arising from interpupillary distance variations. This ability enables humans not just to see but also judge distances accurately because they receive slightly different images due to our horizontal separation of roughly 60mm apart while holding head still. Our brains automatically correct these minor disparities within acceptable limits allowing us to gauge relative size effectively even though individual frames may appear skewed upwards momentarily under certain angles caused mainly via tilted heads causing misalignment beyond typical physiological range leading towards potential diplopia experiences instead unless compensating movements occur
