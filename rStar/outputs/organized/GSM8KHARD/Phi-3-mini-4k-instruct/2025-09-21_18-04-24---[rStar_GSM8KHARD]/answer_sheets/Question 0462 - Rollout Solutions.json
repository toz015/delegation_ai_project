Let L represent the distance Lynn runs; R represents the distance Reggie runs, so we know that (R=P+L), or equivalently (R=L+(P-L)) which can also be written as (R=P). Thus, if Paisley ran four miles and it was stated that Reggie ran five times what Paisley ran, this means that Reggie ran (5*P) which equals (5*4)=(20) miles. It\u2019s additionally said that \u201cReggie...ran three miles farther than Lynn\u201d, meaning Reggie ran further because Lin ran lesser but still equal amount (as per previous equation). Therefore (R=(L)+3); substituting value of our other variables into the above expression would result in ((20)=((L)+3)). As such, subtracting both sides by negative one results in another way of saying the same thing i.e., (L=17). Hence, it follows thusly that Lynn ran seventeen miles while running along side others during their joint exercise regime earlier discussed hereinabove..
