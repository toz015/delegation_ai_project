Hence for courtney\u2019s count of attendees i need to calculate 80 % of  5868369. This can be calculated as follows : (5868369 * 0.8)/1=   4694695.2 . Here since you cannot have fractional part so rounding off this value comes down to nearest whole numbers , hence here your result would become integer now when rounded upwards(since its less than halfway point). In other words whenever dealing wiht percentages always use fractions directly rather doing calculations using decimal representation first.(Note that if calculation involved decimals initially then conversion back into integers requires understanding why those particular digits appeared during previous steps.) Therefore correct computation procedure involves direct application instead multiplication followed division without changing any form already provided due tp prevent errors while converting large values like million etc..
