Each person reads all of their own books plus half (rounded down) of the other's collection since it cannot be split into exact halves due to whole numbers.

Similarly, Pandora would also read 9906866 + floor(Dolly's Books / 2), which equals same amount because flooring operation makes sure we take only complete book counts even if division isn\u2019t perfect. Hence irrespective of who starts reading first or any difference in order, summing up these amounts considering no overlap, comes out to be twice dolly's count. Thus, collective reading happens over double what either individual ends up doing initially owing to combined totals. Adding them together yields resultant value= (Dolly+Panda)'s initial worth*2 .
