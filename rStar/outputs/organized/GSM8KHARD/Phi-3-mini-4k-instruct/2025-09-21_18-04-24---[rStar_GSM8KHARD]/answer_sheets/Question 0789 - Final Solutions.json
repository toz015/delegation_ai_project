Hence no complete 'bag sales'. Therefore considering only whole numbers, even though technically possible mathematically, practically none as normally packaged fruits cannot be divided into such large quantities without being considered spoilage due to lack of proper storage conditions over time thus making them unsellable. Consequently if any revenue generation occurred based purely strictly upon exact mathematics rather than practical feasibility considerations then theoretically yes but pragmatically speaking quite unlikely especially assuming standard commercial operations aiming towards efficient customer service & avoidance of waste through product loss/expiry etc., typically prioritizing bulk sale units i.e minimum order sizes aligning better wth shipping logistics needs enabling ret", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "An apple orchard sells apples in bags of 4228934.
