Therefore, up until this stage, Prince Arthur seems relatively behind regarding combatting prowess based strictly upon raw figures alone.\n\nLooking further through condition 3, if Prince Walter uses twice the force employed by Prince Arthur and ends up taking care of doubled noblemen i.e., killing 75*2= 150 dragons \u2013 indicating improved proficiency due to potentially better preparation or strategy even though employing same type of tool/weapon as per previous individual under consideration(i.e., not considering another kind).
