Firstly we know that Isabel who is our reference person here stands at 7 feet tall.

Since it was said too before that Carl\u2019s height exceeds Ned\u2019s which makes him stand higher making Carls stature equal to(5+1)= 6 ft .Since carl\u2019s measure doesn\u2019t differ when considering his length relative to his own measurement but rather those around him ,his walking stick measures exactly into half this means;half(6=3). Therefore, Carl possesses a measuring apparatus standing  3feet high.
