Let's begin by calculating the weight percentages followed by computing their respective values before comparing them side by side. Note carefully handling fractions along the way. Also remember not to confuse similar units like 'pounds'. Here goes our calculation approach starting off by setting aside any form of shortcut tricks related purely to mathematical properties such as divisibility rules etc., focusing instead strictly following through exact arithmetic procedures until reaching satisfactory answers \u2013 adhering closely toward real numbers rather than approximations wherever possible. First thing I need to clear is confusion arising around different measurements used so lets clarify what exactly we mean concerning gram & kg respectively speaking volumes wise its easy peasy lemon squeezy simple enough yeah right ok cool whatever well lemme get straight into figuring things out bit quick shalllkdsfljdshldjaskdsljdbjsdkljbskdjlsbfasjkndblksajdfjbsdklfjlhsdkjfbaksdfkbjasfd jnlkbsafdlbnvxcbzcxvcbbvbxcvbcncxbdvnxlmnbvqbmnm bmdmnvm", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
