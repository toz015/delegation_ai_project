Condition 2: Alex possesses exactly 5 more Pokemon than Stan. Condition 3: Stan has recorded capturing 13 fewer Pokemon compared to four times what Adelwolfge managed. Using this data, can you determine the exact count of pokemons collected by Stan individually? **Assistant** To solve this problem we first let 'A', 'S', and 'D' represent the numbers of Pokemon captured by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfge respectively. We know from condition two (Alex > Stan) and third(Stan < Adelflof * 4 - 13), therefore our equation becomes A + S + D = 780786; also knowing A = S+5 , or alternatively S=A-5 ; furthermore using Stan\u2019s relationship to Adriwolfge it translates to : S=(Adelwohflg*4)-13 . Plugging those equations back into one another gives us [Adelwohfg*(4-(S/4)+13)]+((S+(S-5))+S)=780786 which simplifies down to [(9*S)/4]=[780786].
