Add together all three sets of annual issues (the newer ones plus the remaining unspecified 'older' ones) so we can find their combined count over time. Let\u2019s assume \u2018older\u2019 refers to just another single publication since having multiple isn\u2019t specified or necessary here. We thus need only subtract one established volume due to its unique quantity being stated separately \u2013 hence bringing our calculation down to counting two volumes instead of treating them individually. Consequently, you gather those figures like such: Summing six distinct entities \u2014 first pairing double digits representing twin collections while also including singular items along individual counts; second combining triplets signifying trio expansions alongside isolated sums inclusive within aggregated tallies into comprehensive totals reflecting accumulative distributions throughout calendar years based upon stipulated rates provided against predetermined quantities across various temporal junctures delineated via ordinal designations relative specifically towards enumeration periods expressed verbatim", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
