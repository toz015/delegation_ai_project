Question: Exactly how many minutes was Movie A running for this session? To find out the durations required for answering such problems effectively requires breaking down complex statements stepwise based on given parameters and mathematical relationships among variables. Let us look at problem solving strategies applied here through examples; you can use similar approaches when tackling other comparative arithmetic word puzzles.", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Firstly let's convert everything into common units i.e., Minutes We know that '1 hour equals to 60 min'. Hence,'Movie C ran for approximately 75 mins',and 'Movie B had run longer by some unknown value x minute(min)'which translates mathematically into:'B=C+x='=(60*1)+x','or simply put--movie_b=75+x.'
