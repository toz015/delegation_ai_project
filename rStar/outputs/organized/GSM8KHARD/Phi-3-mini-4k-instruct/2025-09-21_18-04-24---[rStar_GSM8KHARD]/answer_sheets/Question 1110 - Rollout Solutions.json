The answer is 3500504.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Therefore, Neil saves a total of 8751260 + 3500504 = 12251764 coins each month."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Firstly we need to calculate how many months there are in ten years which equals 10*12= <<10*12=120>>120 months. Secondly, since both save these amounts separately over time it would become (monthly amount saved)x(total no.of months). We can use this formula twice as follows;\nFor rong :  8751260 * 120 => 1050151200. And similarly, following same steps for neil ;   12251764 * 120 -> 1470211680 . To get the combined sum we add them up i.e ,  1050151200+1470211680-> 2520362880.
