Condition 1: \ud83d\udde3\ufe0fMattison\u2019s height = \ud83d\udccf60 inches. \u27a1\ufe0fHouseHeight= HouseType x Height; \u27a1\ufe0fFirstFloorToCeiling = MatTimeThriceOfMatson. Using this given condition we can solve it step wise like below:- First calculate \"Second Floor To Ceiling\" which would equal - (7 * Height) + (Height/3). As mentioned Second story equals seven time matthisons or seven times his height.- Next find \u201cRoof\u201d using Roof = Second Story \u2013(First Floor Toceiling)- So finally our solution becomes -(7*60)+(60/3)=-(420+20)=\u2212440 feet\u200bAs seen above you get negative value because here while solving equation I took upstairs measurement instead of down stairs so subtracted both values to arrive at final result (-440ft), but since asking about only positive numbers use absolute function |x| then again multiply its value by \u22121 ,as follow let us apply formula Absolute(-440)*-1=-440 ft   Therefore Final Answer Is : **-440 Feet**", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Calculate Mattison's second floor to ceiling distance if his house type factor is not considered (\"Use None\").", "subanswer": {"text": "If no specific house type multiplier affects the calculation, we simply take third of Mattison's height for first floor to ceiling.
