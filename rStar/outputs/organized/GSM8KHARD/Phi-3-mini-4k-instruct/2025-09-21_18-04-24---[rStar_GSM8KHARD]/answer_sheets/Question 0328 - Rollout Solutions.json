According to information provided above we know that there are three different types of packet here; one type having 'x' amount (in our case y), another containing double quantity ('y') twice, while third contains triple('z'). Given data states that overall seven packets out of eleven contained value \u2018(double)\u2019 hence leaves only remaining four as triple quantities which equate to z=tripled_quantity. Hence according to formulae stated previously if any variable represents sum over time or iteration then its respective values can easily found adding them up accordingly like so : Total Colors = [Sum Of All Packets] => {[Double Quantity Value]*Quantity}+{[Triple Qntty Val]*Qnttity}. As per problem statement when Double quantitiy was introduced into play variables representing their individual counts became irrelevant i.e.; Whenever you come across such instances just consider those particular iterations/quantities themselves rather than counting using separate formulas respectively therefore keeping original expressions intact except altering relevant parameters would result accurate calculation ; moreover considering hint simplifies process further even though not necessary but highly recommended .
