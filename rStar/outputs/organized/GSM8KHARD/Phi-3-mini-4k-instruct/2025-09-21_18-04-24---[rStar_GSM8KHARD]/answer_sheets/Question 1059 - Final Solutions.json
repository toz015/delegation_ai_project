We know that initially, Christina plans outdoor activities expecting around 6 million guests (6121836), based on past events showing about 1/4th of them cannot make it. This means statistically speaking if all invited turned up, roughly three quarters or 3/4 would actually show up. However, because most of these individuals bring shared resources rather than personal ones, effectively reducing gift needs by another quarter or .75, our calculations need adjustment accordingly before applying cost considerations. Here is a breakdown:\n\nStep One: Calculate Expected Guests Based on Past Trends\nAccording to historical data provided, typically, only 3/4rd of those invited tend to participate. Therefore, estimated no. of attendees equals initial guest count * probability_success which equates approximately to `6,121,836 * 0.75` ~= **4,591,377** people could possibly appear at your gathering.
