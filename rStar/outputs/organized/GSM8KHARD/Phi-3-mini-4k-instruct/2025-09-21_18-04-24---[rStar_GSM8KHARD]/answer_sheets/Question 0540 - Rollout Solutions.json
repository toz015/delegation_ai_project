When Mara triples this amount because she gets hungry, we get (8647392)x(3)=25942176 slices present on the platter. During all these events Mara consumed or misplaced parts of what remains as follows; when she took down 2 out of those multiplied amounts leaving us with (25942176)-2=(25942174). Lastly considering the fact that someone just snuck away with 5 slicey treats, subtracting them further leaves you with (25942174)-5=(25942169), thus concluding our calculation process herein! Hence my closing statement would read something along 'the remaining quantity pertaining specifically towards your query shall equate precisely around [(25942169)]'.
