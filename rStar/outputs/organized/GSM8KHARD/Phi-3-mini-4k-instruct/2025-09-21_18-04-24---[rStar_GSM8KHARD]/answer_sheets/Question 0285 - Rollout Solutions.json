Accordingly, since he retains 2 parts from every five parts i.e., (2/5)x equals 12.8 hectares. Solving yields approximately x being equal to about 32 hectares or rounded up, considering real world factors such as measurement limitations etc; thus, the solution approximates to 32 hectares. Note however that due to constraints inherent in rounding off decimal values, these numbers might slightly vary depending upon precision level chosen during calculation process but they will generally hover close to our calculated approximation hence providing an acceptable range within reasonable limits reflective of actual situation dynamics pertained herein under discussion.
