Converting back to inches yields 0.67 * 12 = 8.04 inches (since you cannot grow part of an inch physically, let's consider full growth increments; thus rounding off makes sense here too). Thus, Adam might need about 8 inches plus however small fraction remains uncounted due to partial growing\u2014so roughly estimated another whole year since he gains 2 inches per year. Hence our approximate rounded figure suggests just over one single year needed under ideal conditions where no other factors affect height gain rate \u2013 but always keeping biological variability & individual circumstances also important!
