Based on condition 1 we see that 'every single time', i.e., once per calendar year; so no additional information about frequency within our defined quarterly interval can alter those figures significantly enough notably across short spans like quarters). This means initially all existing people get their salaries before any recruiting takes place due to timeline constraints mentioned earlier ('start counting only post start date'). Hence if nothing else changes except continued addition based upon preexisting workforce demographics without regard towards potential exponential compounding effects arising either through natural attrition/growth cycles tied directly back onto original baselines being maintained throughout respective temporal partitions described henceforth...
