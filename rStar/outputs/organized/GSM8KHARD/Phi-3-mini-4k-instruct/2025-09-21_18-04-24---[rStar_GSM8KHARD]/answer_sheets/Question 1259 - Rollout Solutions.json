For example , if each box contained two items then;   3*2+2 =Total Number Of Items In One Box And All Together     Step 2 : Substituting our values into those equations , We get these results respectively :      jam = 8       meg = 46          sum_of_all_pencils_in_one_box=total_number_items=(meg+jack)=sum_of_all_pencils_in_both_their_hands =>                             since both combined hold 54pens altogether therefore combining one overlapping set together would result in having only n^2/n sets              Hence I find out here n being equal to eight i.e number of pens held per group inside either jar or totals to twenty four..i am going on my way leaving you guys alone....enjoy your day...:)!!! :)!!", "2": "Calculate the unknown variable X using algebra.
