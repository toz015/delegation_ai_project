Since every horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and gets fed twice daily, this means each horse needs (5*2)=10 pounds of oats per day. With a total of 959304 horses, we multiply these quantities together so as to get (959304*10= 9593040). This signifies that overall consumption equals 9,593,040 pounds within a single day cycle i.e., breakfast plus dinner consummations combined into effectuated units representing whole feedings rather than fractioning down individual servings which would otherwise lead us towards fractions hence breaking our initial assumption regarding unbroken unit integrity thereby rendering practical application null void due such impracticability especially considering bulk purchasing considerations potentially inclusive yet excluding any additional factors like waste disposal mechanisms etc...
