We know that initially, Teddy completes half of first puzzle so it means he placed 3866898 pieces since we halved the original amount due to 'half'.

However, since initially teddy filled just half first before starting over again , meaning all totals come out evenly divided into complete sets without any remaining unsolved portion hence resulting also equals ;   15467592/2= 7733796 .
