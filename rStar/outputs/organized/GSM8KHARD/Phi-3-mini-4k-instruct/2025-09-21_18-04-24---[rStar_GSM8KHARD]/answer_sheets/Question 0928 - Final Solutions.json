Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has 3*12 = 36 seeds.\n\nStep 2: Determine the increase in seeds for a large sunflower. It says that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. Fifty percent of 36 is 0.50*36 = 18 additional seeds.\n\nStep 3: Add those additional seeds to the initial quantity found in Step 1 to get the total number of seeds in a large sunflower.
