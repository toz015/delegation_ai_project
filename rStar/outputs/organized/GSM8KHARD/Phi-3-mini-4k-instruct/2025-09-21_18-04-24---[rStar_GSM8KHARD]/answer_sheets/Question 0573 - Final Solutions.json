Each party effectively splits its portion among themselves; hence multiplying by `3` instead of dividing `(1/2)`. Therefore, $(1/2) / 3$ or `$(1/6)` represents each sibling's fair part of the original full value before any family aid ($300). Hence everyone gets `$100`.\n   \n   Step 2: Find remaining balance post payment using calculated amounts -> From here you know every participant commits approximately '$100'.
