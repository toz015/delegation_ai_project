given condition, we start by setting up the relationship described mathematically. According to Condition 1, the number of cups ('C') Carly makes relative to the number of brownies ('B'), is defined by the equation \\(C = 3B - 2\\). Here, 'B' stands for the amount of brownies, and since no direct numbers are specified regarding either component, we work theoretically around this established formula. However, keeping in line with typical constraints imposed by the instructions received\u2014avoiding approximations unless necessary\u2014we approach real values carefully avoiding reliance solely on manual computation possibly leading toward incorrect interpretations commonly faced in textbook problems lacking precise initial data points about \u2018B\u2019 (the brownies).
