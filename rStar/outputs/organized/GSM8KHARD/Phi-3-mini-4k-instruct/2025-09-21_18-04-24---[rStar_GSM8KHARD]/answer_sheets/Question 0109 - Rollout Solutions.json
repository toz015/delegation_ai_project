First calculate the price before taxes or additional charges which would likely apply (since it hasn\u2019t specified otherwise). Multiply the quantity ($0.1956511) times the amount sold ((6*10)=60), resulting in approximately $11.739066(rounded off because we can not buy part of a cookie). Since this sum doesn't need adjustment beyond basic arithmetic operations, subtracting from $1956511 results as follows; therefore $1956511 - $11.739066 equals roughly $1956500. Thus, considering possible minor rounding differences when dealing out cash, let us state 'approximately'.
