Assuming it means only sales up until stock depletion occurred or provided data correction. Additionally, during the afternoon, fewer but possible quantities - say X loaves \u2013 are accounted for being sold where 'X' needs clarification based upon realistic figures given other constraints like initial inventory plus production minus returns adjustments.
