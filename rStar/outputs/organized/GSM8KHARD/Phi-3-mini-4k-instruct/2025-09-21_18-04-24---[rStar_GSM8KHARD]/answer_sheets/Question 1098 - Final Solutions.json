We know that Bernadette's journey takes several times longer than Wayne's journey. Specifically, we are told here that the time taken by Bernadette is equal to 'x', which equals 5891617 times Wayne's travel time. This means if Wayne took 't' amount of time, then Berndette would take 'xt'. Given these details, since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 mins early compared to Wayne; therefore subtract those 5mins from her overall departure time. Thus, Bernadette should start departing ('b') 5 mins lesser than what Wayne starts so that even though both journeys last till 5891617*t minute mark but when summed up Bertadette arrives exactly 5 min ahead of Wayne.
