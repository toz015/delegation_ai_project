We add up known quantities first \u2013 Rainbow cookies plus Oatmeal cookies equals 2595 + 8771730 = 8774325 cookies. Since these account for everything else but Chocolate chip cookies, then if you subtract from the overall number created thus far, i.e., Total Cookies minus Other types of cookie yields the quantity of Chocolate chip ones.
