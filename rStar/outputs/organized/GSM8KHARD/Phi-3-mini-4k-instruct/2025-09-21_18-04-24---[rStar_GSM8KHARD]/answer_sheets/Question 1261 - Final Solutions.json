Here X equals 2 so decreasing lessen effect becomes null..here decrease rate comes into picture i.e., halving ..halving same thing makes double instead of making any change....same logic applies like dividing anything by zero yields infinity ....but never negative values.....if divided by positive numbers results finite output only while divides zero produces infinite values....negative signs make all outputs go away though leaving absolute sign behind........multiplication takes inverse operation of subtraction & addition operations respectively when applied onto negatives ; whereas division reverses process again furthermore affects magnitudes accordingly depending whether input remains constant rather changing overtime", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
