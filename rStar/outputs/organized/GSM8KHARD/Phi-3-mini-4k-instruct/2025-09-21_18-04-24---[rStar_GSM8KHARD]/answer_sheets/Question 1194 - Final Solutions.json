It seems initially rapid depletion continues reducing linearly ('decreasing regularly') but eventually slows significantly\u2014a common pattern seen in resource consumption behaviors. However, calculating the remaining life span of Maria's phones strictly requires either the original capacity of the batteries and their current state or knowing explicitly detailed daily energy loss factors. Assuming optimal functioning scenarios could lead us astray since real situations commonly experience variabilities. Therefore, although theoretically plausible estimates might exist depending upon additional inputted information, currently available knowledge doesn't permit pinpoint precision prediction around deadlines nor accurately detail behavior patterns exhibited chronologically according to your prompt.
