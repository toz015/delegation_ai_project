original amount which Dean would give away to Jamie. One fifth equals (1 / 5) * 5697680 =  1139536. Next we subtract this quantity along with ten extra ones to find out the remainder. Therefore it becomes : 5697680 - 1139536 - 10 = 4558134. This means Dean still retains 4558134 Marbles leaving him without any loss due to these transactions.
