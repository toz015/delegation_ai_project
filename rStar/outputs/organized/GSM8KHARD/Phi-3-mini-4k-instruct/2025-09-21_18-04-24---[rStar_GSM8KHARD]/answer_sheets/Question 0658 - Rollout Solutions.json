Combined ownership totaled 4140180 \u2013 5 since five new notebooks were added later. This sums up to M + 3M equals 4140175. Hence, solving yields M equating to roughly 1380058 notes when rounded down to whole numbers because you cannot possess part of a note. Consequently, Joseph possessed about 4140175 \u2212 1380058 = approximately  2760117 documents or papers from these calculations roundings. Thus, using all exact figures without any need to approximate would lead us to conclude that Joseph possesses precisely 3 \u00d7 4140175 divided by 4 equals exactly 3105131 sheets written materials post account adjustments due to precise calculation requirements.
