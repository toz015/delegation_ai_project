Our first multiplication now looks like [(original amount)(multiplier)] which equals [3*(2/3)=]~2 rounded down due to fractions not being possible amounts here so Alice actually only observed about half again rather than exactly one third additional cumulative cloud formations over these specific three subsequent weeks making sure you understand why I included such details regarding the interpretation of fractional values versus whole numbers during actual observations made by individuals engaged in activities similar but distinctly different from strictly quantitative scientific measurements.)
