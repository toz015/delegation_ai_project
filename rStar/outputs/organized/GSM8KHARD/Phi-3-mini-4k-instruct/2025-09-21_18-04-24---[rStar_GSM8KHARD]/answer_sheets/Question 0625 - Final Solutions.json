To obtain Junieta's income using condition 2 stating she gets 10% less than Rafaela, first understand that if 10% off means reducing something by its own 1/10 fractional part. Applying this concept translates into subtracting 10% worth of Rafaela's totals ($76,085,060) resulting in $7,608,506 extracted away due to Juneetta receiving only about 10% inferiority concerning Rafaela.
