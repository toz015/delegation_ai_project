We can denote the unknown value shared among them equally as \u2018k.\u2019 Here, 'price_amazon', 'shipping_cost_amazon', 'price_ebay', 'shipping_cost_ebay', represent prices respectively including their respective shipping fees calculated per item sold over a certain base amount \u2014 potentially indicating sales volume discount rates applied to pricing structures when comparing different sellers/platforms such as Amazon and eBay.
