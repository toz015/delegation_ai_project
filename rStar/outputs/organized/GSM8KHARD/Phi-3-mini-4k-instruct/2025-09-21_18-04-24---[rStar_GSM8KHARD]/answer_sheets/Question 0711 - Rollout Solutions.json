Every time Pamela applies sunscreen it lasts until next application which takes place exactly after hour so during four (hours) consecutive exposure she needs only once but as we know that all these applications happen daily hence in eight(days), pamella would require just twice i.e.,two times because;she used up first round while outdoors and second round within same period again before going back inside .
