Taking these calculations together yields Total Point Units (TPU)=((30)-((X)*(6)+(X))) where 'X' denotes unknown additional factor related to Anna's age over Alyana'. This calculation could provide useful information depending upon whether specific values need assignment within variable terms like Age Difference represented hereby via 'X', but without concrete data defining variables cannot offer final numerical solution beyond algebraic representation.

Condition 3: The problem also states Anne's age which requires two steps; first finding Alyana's age then adding it up with her own constant plus another year (indicated \"she\" refers to Anne).

Firstly, according to **Condition 1**, Chenny's current age is stated as being exactly ten years old. Moving onto **Condition 2**, if you subtract four years from Chenny's present age, you get Alyana's age because it was specified that Alyana is precisely four years younger than Chenny. That means Alyana is currently eight years old (since \\(10 \\text{years} - 4 \\text{years} = 6 \\text{years}\\)).
