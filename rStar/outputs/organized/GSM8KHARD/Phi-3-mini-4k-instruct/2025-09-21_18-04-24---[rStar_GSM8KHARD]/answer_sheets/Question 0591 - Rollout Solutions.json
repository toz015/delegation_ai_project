Given you mentioned no specific values aside from these generalities, I can provide guidance accordingly. Here it goes:\n\nInitial Population (P): Start off with N as the original quantity before applying subsequent changes. We define P initially as N if not stated otherwise.\nGrowth Rate (r): Since the problem states that populations double regularly without dropping out, we deduce r=2 because multiplying something twice results in quadrupling when compared across units/measurements equivalent like months rather than years due to compounding effects. To accommodate periodic application such as per month basis instead annual terms could simply divide said figure appropriately based on contextual understanding unless specifically dictated differently \u2013 i.e., once annually versus several times inside same span etc.).
