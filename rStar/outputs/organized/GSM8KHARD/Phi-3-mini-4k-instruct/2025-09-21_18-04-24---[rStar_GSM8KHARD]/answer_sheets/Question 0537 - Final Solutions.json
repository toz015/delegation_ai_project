Each cupcake costs fifty cents, so three cupcakes cost 0.50 * 3 = 1.50 dollars. This means Olivia spent all of her remaining money because initially she only had $2 which was less than the amount she needs for purchasing any cupcakes since even just one would require double her starting funds. Therefore, without additional information suggesting otherwise, I conclude that Oliva cannot afford these cupcakes with her original balance. To make up for this scenario though purely hypothetically \u2013 assuming she could somehow obtain finance assistance or found spare change elsewhere \u2013 having already used all available monies including coins, no remainder remains post acquisition unless external sources are employed to cover part or full payment difference thus necessitating further clarification of actual spendings aside direct coin possession. Thus insufficient data prevents pinpoint accuracy rendering estimation impracticable barring speculative assumptions absent concrete evidence affirmative context establishment verifying fiscal state transitions occurred subsequent preliminary engagements", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
