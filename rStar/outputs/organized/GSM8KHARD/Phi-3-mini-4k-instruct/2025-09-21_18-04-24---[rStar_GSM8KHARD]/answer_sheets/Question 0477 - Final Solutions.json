We know that Finley took 30 minutes to prepare rice. To find out how long it took to cook pork we add 20 extra minutes since pork requires 20 additional minutes compared to rice.

Adding them results in (50minute(Pork)+30 minute(Rice))=80 minutes. This indicates that if one wants to determine bean preparation duration; you need only consider halving whatever sum resulted above because according to instructions, Bean taking session is exactly equivalent to half the summative timing obtained when adding Pork plus Rice timespan durations as seen earlier hence resulting((80*half)=40 mins)).
