But since exact quantities aren\u2019t mentioned here, let us denote the resultant sales price as R ($). To find out if any returns will occur depends upon whether R equals exactly payments made; otherwise discrepancy occurs demanding further calculation based off those amounts when available \u2013 i.e., \u2018R=$[payment received]\u2019 versus '$[amount due back to customers]. Answer cannot specify without knowing either purchase cost per unit OR cumulative receipts post-transaction detailled above(and thus pending resolution below).

Next, calculate the sum of the banknotes offered as partial payment through multiplication of ten thousands and ones place values together while ignoring hundreds because it doesn't affect the change required: 1*1+0=1*. Thus, only $. However, once again you don't provide enough details about changes needed so I am unable proceed accurately.
