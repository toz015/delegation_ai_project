We know that Harry slept 9 hours. To find out how long James slept we calculate (2/3)*9 which equals 6 hours as per our previous calculation. Therefore, if you subtract these numbers together i.e., Harry's sleep time minus James', this would yield us the difference; so, 9-6=3. Thus, Harry slept three more hours than James. But wait! According to my initial instructions provided earlier about solving such problems using Python code, I initially calculated it correctly but mistakenly suggested another method here based on hints instead of adhering strictly to those guidelines. Here's the accurate solution according to original instruction requirements without any external hints or methods being used : Let python_code=\"harry_sleep = 9\\njames_sleep = harry_sleep * 2 / 3\\ndifference_in_hours = harry_sleep - james_sleep\" return eval(python_code).
