We know Juan's house is valued at $53,200. From earlier calculations, we determined that Herb's house, which costs $76,000, actually allows us to infer that since Juan saved around 30% upfront due to lower initial purchase prices, thereby making him potentially profitable over time depending upon housing appreciation rates; hence combining totals yields ($76,000 + $53,200) equalling roughly $129,200 overall valuation before any changes in property taxes or other ownership expenses not factored into our current contextual analysis.
