Condition 2: The duration of this task extends over 3 full weeks (with the assumption being that we consider \"a day\" as part of standard working time). Condition 3: Painters contribute equally throughout the given period; hence it implies dividing labor uniformly amongst themselves based upon available manpower or operational feasibility constraints within provided parameters such as 'days', assuming normal human productive capacity during regular working hours without considering variations like fatigue which might impact actual output rates. Understanding individual contributions requires calculation factoring not only raw headcount but also allocation strategies relative to overall project scope\u2014this would typically involve

Additionally, incorporating better pay structures, flexible scheduling options, improved facilities/equipment upgrade, implementing modern workplace designs encouraging collaboration while reducing downtime caused by miscommunication, errors or other issues typical in traditional settings.
