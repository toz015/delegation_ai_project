Let X represent the cow population; hence we can say Farmer Brown owns 2X chickens (since it was mentioned farmers brown possesses double amount of chickens than cows).

First, let's denote the quantity of cows farmers brown possesses as 'c'. As per provided data, Bakerown holds twice as numerous chickens which would lead us into formulating expression like so: `Chicks = Chicken/cow count*2`. Since every animal maintains its standard amount quadruple leg units (i.e., one duo consists of a pair of equines paired upwards alongside doubled contiguous pairs forming our desired unit measure) we could translate said information onto formula such as follows: Four(`equine` multiplied by `'number'`of cattle)+doublet(*two*`quantity``of''chickens`) equal sum (`total numb...') . Following these instructions leads us straightway upon establishment of mathematical notation presented below : ```quadruplicates('count_of_cattle')` plus DoubleTwos(`twice_the_count_of_chickens)` equals TotalNumbbs(`sum_all_legs`).

Then the number of chickens will be represented by y*(number of cattle) since they also contribute their own numbers of legs per animal. We know from the problem statement that Chicken Leg Count (y)*Chicken Headcount (Number of Chickens)= Total Animal Limbs count(x). Simplifying these terms yields CowLegCount=TotalAnimalLimbs/(ChickenHeadcount+CowHeadcount), making our equation equal to TallyDifference=(Twice[Numberofcows]- NumberOfAnimals)/[Four+(Two times [NumberOfanimals]/Tallydifferance)] Solving algebraically results in TwoTimescowheadcount equals one hundred ninety eight thousand five hundred seventeen plus OneHundred Sixty Thousand seven Hundred Eighteen .
