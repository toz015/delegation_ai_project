Here\u2019s why these particular behaviors might vary across various animal types compared to human behavior patterns:\n\n1) Physical Capabilities: Some animals possess unique physiological traits which allow them to manipulate objects easily. Woodpeckers don't actually carry sticks or other materials; instead, instinctively peck holes into bark until they find soft areas filled with food sources such as grubs. Their bill structure enables precise drilling without causing harm to themselves. Humans also can create basic implements (like digging sticks), yet it doesn't necessarily lead us towards habitual tool creation unless we perceive specific benefits outweighing effort involved in crafting & utilizing those instruments repeatedly.\n\n2) Cognitive Abilities / Problem Solving Skills: Tool usage involves understanding cause-effect relationships \u2014 knowing what action leads to desired outcome through trial-and-error learning experiences gained during development stages .
