Yes, it translates into V->~(E), meaning whenever Mike plays video games, it implies that he didn\u2019t get home early. However, since 'early enough' isn't defined strictly within our domain here without numerical values or additional context, let's interpret it simply such that getting home earlier than expected allows playing video games but doesn't necessarily preclude him doing so if arriving exactly on time\u2014in which case E would imply neither W nor V based solely on these statements.
