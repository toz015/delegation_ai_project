Following this logic, utilizing N amount of potatoes generates C times M hash browns (\\(\\frac{N}{M} = R\\)), thereby allowing calculation involving different quantities while preserving proportionality\u2014for instance, determining Z hash browns derived from V potatoes involves multiplying D (equal to `C`, previously established through comparative analysis via substitution methodology).
