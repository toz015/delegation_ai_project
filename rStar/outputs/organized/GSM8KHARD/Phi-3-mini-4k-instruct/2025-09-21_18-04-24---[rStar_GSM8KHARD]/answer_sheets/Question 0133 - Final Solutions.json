Condition 1:  The trader acquires several bags of wheat from a farmer at a price of $20 per bag. Condition 2: It incurs a transportation expense of $2 per bag when moving goods from the farm to his storage facility (warehouse). Condition 3: Upon finalizing sales, wherein the entire stock was transacted at a unit price of $30 per bag, the trader realized a net gain amounting to $5473548. Question: Based on this data, can you ascertain the exact count of bags that the trader successfully managed to vend within the specified timeframe? Please provide only numeric values without any further elaboration or explanation. As requested, here are responses formatted according to instructions provided \u2013 numerical answers derived directly from analyzing given scenarios based upon hypothetical calculations.
