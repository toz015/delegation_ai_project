Since John has 3 such identical boxes, you multiply their individual volumes together resulting in 48 cubic inches multiplied by itself thrice i.", "subanswer": {"text": "Answer: Considering the reduction due to wall thickness, the interior measure calculates to 3inches X 4inches X 4inches=48cubic_inches; henceforth, since John owns 3 similar sized units within himself, multiplication occurs between those measures yielded thereby being equal to 48cubic_inches^3 or  48X48X48 =7776 cubic inches overall across his property.

Condition 1:  John possesses 3 containers, each measuring externally as follows - Length (L): 5 inches Width (W): 6 inches Height (H): 4 inches Wall thickness: 1 inch. To find 'Inner Volume', we must subtract twice the wall thickness from each external dimension because there are two opposing sides for each measurement on which the subtraction occurs i.e., length minus double its width, same goes for height too. Thus, internal dimensions become [(5-2) x (6-2)] cubic units = [3x4] cubic units; similarly ((7*9)*(5))^cubic units= [[[4*3]*[[6*5]]]= 108 cu cm respectively. Since this calculation applies uniformly across all three boxes due to similarity in size & structure, multiplying one calculated value \"inner_volume\" by count(\"box\") would yield our solution. Hence condition 2:\"To calculate individual container volumes simply multiply outer measurements taken above.\" Finalized query could read something like:   Calculate the combined interior capacity of all three uniform structures given initial exterior parameters alongwith respective layered reduction factorization process applied thrice consecutively using arithmetic operations including multiplication but omitting addition where possible\".
