Given that your bathroom floor covers 200 sq ft but isn't precisely measured in 'tiles', so assume this space translates into entire tiles covering surface uniformly divided equally among rows/columns since most homes aren't perfectly geometrical squares or circles. This implies using whole count rather than fractions which wouldn't make practical sense. Therefore, every single square foot requires only one part piece regardless whether half or quarter parts exist separately elsewhere. Assuming perfect fitment scenario also excludes wasted edges making full use through edge trimming creating no surplus cutoffs leaving behind zero remnants post completion yield exactly match original requirement minus nothing leftover too! Hence ideal situation equals direct correlation ratio equal amount both ways leading simplicity formula Tiles_Required=Total Area To Cover / Size Per Single Piece .
