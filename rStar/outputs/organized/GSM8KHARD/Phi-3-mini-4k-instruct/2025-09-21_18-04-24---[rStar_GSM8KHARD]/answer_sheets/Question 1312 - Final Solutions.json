Thus concluding; Everyone gets roughly equal parts \u2013 around half million dollars over two years! But let\u2019s round off our numbers now since decimals don't make sense here anyway .

Doing that calculation results in $1168833.60 paid collectively throughout the entirety of said period. Given everybody contributes evenly during such times without any hitches regarding fairness while keeping contentment levels high overall \u2014 well, isn't life grand sometimes ? It surely was enlightening assisting through your financial queries thus far !! Hopefully those figures resonated properly along side providing clarification wherever necessary !
