Our primary goal is to see if Antonella's $2500 sales surpasses said benchmark figure. However, considering Antonella sold just $2500, this clearly remains far beneath the stipulated cutoff point of $452,7068. Thus, Antonella isn't subjected to those increased rates based purely off these data points shared.
