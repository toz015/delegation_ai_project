Let's follow these steps as suggested in your question: first we need to find out how many legs all four legged tables contribute altogether.

Answer Q_answer AS Big Oh notation represents an upper bound estimate In computer science, big O notation provides a mathematical representation of algorithm complexity. Specifically, it classifies algorithms according to their growth rates relative to input size, allowing developers and researchers to compare computational costs and predict performance issues related to scaling inputs. By categorizing functions based on specific criteria like worst case scenario running times, average cases, best cases etc., one can determine whether certain problems remain tractable as problem sizes increase\u2014and what resources they might demand accordingly.
