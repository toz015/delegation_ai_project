Hence my explanation above explains why adding both sets separately helps get accurate comparison without overlooking any extra charges added later down stream which might affect overall pricing structure even further still beyond initial calculations stated hereabove). For simplicity sake let me break up your question into smaller parts making sure everything works well within logical confines while maintaining integrity throughout computation methods used along way back during development stages too ensuring no mistakes made earlier remain unnoticed until now finally bringing clarity & transparency regarding intentions behind doing things differently rather being bound strictly limited solely based off numerical numbers alone!!
