Condition 1:  Eliza earns $1616598 per hour when working up to 40 hours a week. Condition 2: For any time beyond those initial 40 hours, referred to as 'overtime', Eliza gets paid at a rate which is 1.2 times her standard hourly wage. Question: With respect to the provided conditions, what would Eliza\u2019s income amount to on a workweek wherein she logged precisely 45 hours? Remember not to use actual figures or numbers but represent it symbolically using variables such as \"h\", instead of specific numerical amounts like \"$7$. Also ensure you avoid ambiguity while formulating both the problem statement and solution pathway within our system constraints; maintain clarity without resorting to external examples or numeric values associated with typical employment scenarios (e.g., tax rates). The formula representing elizas normal payment = h * x, and its corresponding representation accounting for Overtime= [(h - 40) + 40] * y(which represents the multiplier factor applied onto her ordinary salary), could serve here effectively though care must be taken ensuring clear differentiation across variable symbols denoting distinct components \u2013 henceforth prevent confusion around usage amongst students during assessments/solutions process . This approach aligns well given previous instruction set limitations stipulated above : First off we define base_rate -> b , then calculate bonus based upon extra time exchanged via following equation `base_pay`+(extra)*(`bonus`) thereby providing accurate results even under changing parameters regarding frequency & intensity levels experienced throughout respective periods covered thus far ; Second important point worth mentioning involves consideration surrounding maximum possible gains achievable through said methodology including further optimization techniques aimed towards achieving best result yield according situational needs present case wise !!
