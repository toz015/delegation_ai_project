subjects based upon their complexity level while ensuring mental freshness throughout, you may consider using spaced repetition along with interleaved practice as strategies\u2014which can aid both

Also note which concepts come up repeatedly regardless so schedule them earlier than others less frequently seen ones according empirical findings about primacy effects influencing early memory formation processes strongly impact recall performance positively especially regarding abstract material compared tangible objects learned separately instead together simultaneously thus avoid confusion arising multiple simultaneous exposures resulting incorrect associations made subsequently leading errors committed ultimately impairment further academic success rate drastically despite initial intentions toward", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To create an efficient plan catering to Alex's mathematical inclination and Taylor's love for literature, several key components need consideration.
