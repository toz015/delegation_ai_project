During the promotional event when items are offered at 10% off their regular prices, they become cheaper; hence the effective selling price becomes reduced or lowered. Here let us denote 'x' representing pre-discount price i.e., ($111230); & denoting Y indicating post-discount rate i.e., '$111230 minus', say xx%, wherein case here '%xx%=10'. Then our new equation transforms into something resembling => [(($111230)-$11123)*n]/[numberOfUnitsN]. Whereby n represents no.ofboxes&n=$2$. Hence finally substituting back respective figures yields $([$111230-$11123]*2)/[no.$ofunitesbought]= [($100107*$2)]/$2=[totalcostforallitems]$+$([averageunitpriceperitem]), respectively, thereby equating $$to $[totalCostForAllItems] \\div [TotalNumberOfContactPairs]+[\\text{AverageUnitPricePerItem}], ultimately finalizing results upwards yielding $\\frac{$200214}{2}=\\$100107$, therefore deducing conclusively that upon purchase of twp contact pouches priced ordinarily standing at `$11123`, following the application of said percentage reduction via sales proceedings, individual pairs garner worth not exceedingly beyond `\\(\\$100107\\)`.
