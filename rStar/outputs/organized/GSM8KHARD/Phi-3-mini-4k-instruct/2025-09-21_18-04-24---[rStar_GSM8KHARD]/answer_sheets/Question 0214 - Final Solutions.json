Typically, children begin kindergarten at ages 5\u20136 and finish high school around age 17\u2014assuming standard education systems here where grades follow closely behind academic progression. Hence, if starting kindergarten at age 5, then attendance lasted approximately eight consecutive seasons across Grades 1 to 10. Since each season comprises precisely ten matches resulting in individual success rewarded exclusively via gold medals under uniform distribution rules stipulated within our scenario framework, multiplying the annual accumulation rate directly scales linearly over nine durational periods (not accounting for the initial nonconsecutive fifth-grade term).
