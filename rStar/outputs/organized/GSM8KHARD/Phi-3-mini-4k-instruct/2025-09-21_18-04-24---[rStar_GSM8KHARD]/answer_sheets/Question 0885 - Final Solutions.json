The final result would then represent Charlie's income earned during those working hours spent instructing clients based on the given parameters specified within the problem statement itself. This calculation can provide us insightful data about not just his business practices regarding pricing adjustments made particularly towards servicemen or women but also demonstrating him being generous enough sharing knowledge via reducing fees where possible; thus contributing positively both financially & socially!
