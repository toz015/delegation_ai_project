Firstly, we calculate the increased cost of staying at the hotel due to demand during their visit. Normally, the hotel charges $1500 per night but since it\u2019s booked during a busy period, this increases by 20%. To find out what this increase amounts to, multiply $1500 by 20%, i.e., $1500*(20/100) which equals $300. Adding up these extra fees results into new daily rate of ($1500+$300)=$1800 as opposed to original charge being just $1500. Since Tom and his spouse stayed in the same hotel for three (3) consecutive days, the total amount spent would thus become equal to [($1800)*(days)]=[$1800]*[3]= $5400.
