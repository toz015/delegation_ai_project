Over 8 weeks, this scenario amounts to 8*4=<<8*4=32>>32 hours of workouts.\n\nStep 2: Account for variations due to extended exercises over certain weeks\nWe need to consider the fact that throughout these 8 weeks, there occurred special moments wherein Josh exercised beyond usual limits i.e., spending 5 hours for two successive weeks followed by just having single instance taking him upto 6 hour mark. This adds onto our calculation since such increments differ from average ones making them worthy additions while calculating totals. Therefore keeping track separately helps us avoid double counting like mentioned earlier .
