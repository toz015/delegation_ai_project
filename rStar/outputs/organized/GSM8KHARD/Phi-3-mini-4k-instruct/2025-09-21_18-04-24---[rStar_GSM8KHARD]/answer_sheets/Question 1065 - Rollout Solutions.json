According to the problem statement, seven years later (i.e., when both their ages increase), Shiloh would be thrice as old as his nephew; hence we can write this relationship algebraically like so:  44+7=3*( n+7). Let\u2019s solve it further:   51=3*n+21 --> subtracting 21 on both sides => 51-21=3*n ==> 30=3*n. Hence dividing both sides by 3 yields :  30/3=n or simply put -- > n equals 10 . Therefore, according to our calculations , Shiloh's nephew is currently ten years old.

Substituting shiloh's age yields :   35=3*(44+(7))-(x), or equivalently;    35=3*51 -(x) . Simplifying both sides results in      35=153 -(x)        Which leads us conclude that ;      x=-118/-3          Answer: Thus, Nephew cannot logically exist because negative numbers do not make sense here since they refer to someone's age. Hence no solution exists for such scenario whereby Neephew may never exist if these conditions hold true! There might have been some error during formulation process leading up till now but let me explain what could possibly happen instead .. Firstly consider case like father being younger compared mother ' s thus making possible possibility arises allowing calculation logic behind getting realistic solutions provided certain assumptions made prior along mathematical formulae used later down lines including basic algebra rules applied correctly without missing steps throughout whole computation procedure required solving equations involved..

Since |r|<1 guarantees convergence in a geometric series regardless of what 'x' might represent (given any real numbers involved other than zero) due to the nature of exponential decay being stronger than linear growth, the original series thus converges absolutely for all values of x outside the unit circle centered about origin i.e., whenever |\\(|x/2|\\)| > 1; meaning |x| > 2.
