Let me breakdown parts of those sentences individually first before connecting them together conceptually:\n\n\"Now Considering Days NN & MMM Equally Distributed Over Period PPTP\": This part suggests evaluating time periods called Day NN and Day MM under consideration being spread out evenly across another timeline referred to herein as Period PPTP. Here 'NN' and 'MMM' represent placeholders meant to symbolize specific dates within our calendar system; however, precise details about these particular instances aren't available yet because no such information was previously supplied. Similarly, period 'PPTP' stands likewise metaphorically hinting towards any sort of chronological segment you may want to assess but lacks explicit definition until actual figures come up.
