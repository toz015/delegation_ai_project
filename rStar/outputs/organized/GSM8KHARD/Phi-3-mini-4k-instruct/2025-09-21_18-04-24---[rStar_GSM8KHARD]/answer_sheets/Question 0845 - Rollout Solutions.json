Therefore, if this was meant as part of a mathematical problem without realistic constraints on score increments per action taken in a game context\u2014and considering integer values only can apply here due to practicality in sporting events like soccer\u2014we could interpret these figures symbolically following conventional arithmetic operations. This leads us directly toward multiplying certain factors together based upon provided ratios related to their performance differential across both divisions of playing time depicted in terms numerical representation linked explicitly through multiplication factor correlations mentioned subsequently.) During halftime, Team B therefore managed ten less compared against its counterpart from prior phase activity ((team_b_first_half) * (-2)).
