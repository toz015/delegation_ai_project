Firstly, Elvis drove away from his house toward the west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph. Therefore, the distance driven in this first part of the trip is `speed` multiplied by `time`, meaning `18 mph x 5 hrs = 90 miles`. As per instructions, distances moving oppositely ought not signify positivity; therefore, considering western movement as negative adds up `-90 miles`. Upon turning again due northwest for 8 hours maintaining the same speed results in him having moved further ahead, amounting to `18 mph x 8 hrs = 144 miles`. Since eastern motion contrasts previously made western progressions, applying similar rules makes us acknowledge southward (`negative`) moves resulting in `-144 miles.` Hence, calculating net horizontal displacement requires subtractive operation `(Western Progress minus Eastern Recess)`.
