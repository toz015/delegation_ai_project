First let\u2019s calculate your savings when buying individual items rather than sets or packages as such information isn't provided. From previous hint we know the percent saving per tub of ice cream which can also apply here since no further instructions suggest otherwise. It would therefore mean exactly same calculations applied individually instead being grouped together. This means for every single tub saved it saves around 15.38%, so calculating these values separately yields our base amount i.e., without grouping them into any specific bundle deal. Each packet of milk sees a direct dollar off based on current sales prices not factoring anything else other than quantity purchase. With all this said, moving forward onto actual calculation: Two tubs of Ice Cream purchased lead us directly through multiplication due to constant pricing whether bundled up or not thus yielding $(11*2). Simultaneously four packets of Milk fetches out similar result though addition takes place ($1*(packet_of_milk_price)*quantity), replacing '(packet_of_milk_price)' respectively equals '$1'.
