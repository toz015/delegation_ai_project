Firstly, we know Bethany runs 7719166 laps. Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany so Trey would run 7719166+4=7719170 laps. Next, it says Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey which means Shaelyn ran (7719170)/2 = 3859585 laps. Finally, since Quinn only manages to complete 2 less laps than what Shaelyn managed, hence Quinn was able to finish running just ((3859585)-2) i.e., 3859583 laps within the same duration(hour).
