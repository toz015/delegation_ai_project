But since it states 'equal sale', it implies all three periods sell equal amounts; therefore dividing those ten into three segments isn\u2019t practically possible because you cannot split up whole items like loaves perfectly evenly among time intervals without breaking them apart or having fractions. Therefore considering practical scenarios while maintaining fairness across sales timeslot i.e., making sure no period sells less than another one unless absolutely necessary, rounding off would result us distributing seven loaves during Afternoon sales.
