However since age does not stop kids from doing things, I suggest you encourage them on their way instead! Answer: Approximately Seven Days. Remember real life situations might differ due various factors like emergencies etc but fundamentally mathematics holds true here :) Question: Robin decided she wanted new pencils for school.
