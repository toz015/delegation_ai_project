Firstly, we need to find out how many pounds of onions Antoine uses when he doubles the original requirement. Since the recipe asks for 2 pounds of onions, doubling this would result in him using 2 pounds times 2 which equals 4 pounds. To calculate the cost of these onions before rounding off, multiply the price per pound ($4768737) by the quantity used (4 pounds). This results in a total cost of $4768737*4=$19074948. Next divide this sum by the servings provided(which is 6), so you get approximately$3179158. Therefore, rounded up to the nearest dollar, it costs about $3179158 per serving considering only the cost contributed by the onions alone as prices may vary depending upon other ingredients like meat or vegetables. As asked specifically concerning just 'onions', every person gets one share worth roughly $3179158 due solely to them consuming half of all available onions served within the meal.
