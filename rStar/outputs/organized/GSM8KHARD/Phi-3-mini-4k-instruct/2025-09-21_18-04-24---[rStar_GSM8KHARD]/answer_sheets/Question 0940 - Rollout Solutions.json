Half of Matthew's collections equate to around 1014502 toy soldiers since it divides evenly due to having an even quantity initially which doesn\u2019t require rounding off any figures here. Selling these at $5 per soldier yields roughly 1014502 * $5 = $5072510. Similarly selling another portion amounting to same count ($1014502) but priced higher at $7 fetches ~ 1014502 * $7= $7101514. Hence summing up both amounts provides us Matthew's potential earnings being ~$5072510+$7101514=$12174024 upon agreement.

Half of  2029004 can be calculated as follows: `Half_Collection=Total_Collection/2` which results in `Half_Collection = 2029004 / 2`. This equals approximately 1014502 units. These constitute both groups since we divided equally beforehand according to question statement. According to the question , one group was sold off for `$5 per unit`, so sales made due to this pricing scheme totals : `GroupA_Earnings = PricePerUnit*NumberOfUnitsInThatPart = 5 * GroupA_CountingWhich equate roughly to `GroupA_Earnings=5*1014502` . Similarly second part mentioned selling another portion (`the same amount`) but different prices i.e., `$7 per unit`.
