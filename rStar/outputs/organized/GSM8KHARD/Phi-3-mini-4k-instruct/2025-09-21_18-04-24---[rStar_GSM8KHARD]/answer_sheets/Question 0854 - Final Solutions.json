As we know, Jay creates roughly 0.3333(~one third) snowball per minute so over an interval of 60 minutes he produces 0.3333*60 i.e., 20 snowballs as expected. But also, during these same intervals of time, approximate amount of snowballs get deformed into water hence disappearing namely .3333*(number_of_minutes)/meltings_per_hour , since this happens thrice every hour therefore overall loss becomes (.3333/(15)*3)=1.6667approximately meaning around 1.6667 less than what was produced through out the full span of an hour.. This leaves him exactly maintaining count without change when calculating only taking production rate versus natural decay rate into account...

Since 2 snowballs melt out of what Jay builds every 15 minutes, so in an hour (which consists of four intervals of fifteen minutes), twice those amounts get wasted i.e., 2*4=8. Therefore effectively Jay only creates about (20-(2*4)) = 12 new snowballs during these hours. This implies that Jays net production of good quality snowballs over time scales down to roughly just under half its initial output when considering melts too. Hence if initially you start off building at pace p(x)=constant ,then your real progress represented through actual creation takes place according P'(t)=p(t)*(.5).
