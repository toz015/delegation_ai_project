First, clearly defining \"childhood\" isn't universal, so base calculation can vary widely depending on local customs or defined educational/legal systems which specify the minimum age considered capable of handling responsibilities similar to adulthood. However, commonly used markers include achieving higher secondary school grades, obtaining driving licenses, joining military forces, entering puberty signs like menstruation in females or voice changes in males, among others.
