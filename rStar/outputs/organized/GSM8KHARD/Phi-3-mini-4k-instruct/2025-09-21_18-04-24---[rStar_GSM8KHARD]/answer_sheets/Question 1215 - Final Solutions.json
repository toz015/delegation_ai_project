Condition 1: 4,109,778 are counted as stuffed puppies belonging to Bubbles; plus five stuffed koalas, two stuffed zebras, and four stuffed frogs currently belong to Bubbles. Constraint 1 (percentage): The countable quantity must constitute exactly 30 percent of the overall collection post addition. To find this value, we first determine the initial amount using summation notation or direct arithmetic calculations given known quantities then calculate what would represent 30%. With both values established, one subtracts current stock numbers summed up via algebraic methods or counting techniques considering combinatorics where applicable within numerical boundaries set forth originally.
