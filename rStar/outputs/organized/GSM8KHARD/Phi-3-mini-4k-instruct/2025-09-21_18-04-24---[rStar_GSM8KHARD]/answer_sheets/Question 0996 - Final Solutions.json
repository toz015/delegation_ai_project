Condition 1:  The original price of the watch is $5081959. Condition 2: Mr. Rogers purchased the watch at 75% of this value (the 'discounted_price'). Condition 3: Mr. Rogers later resold the watch to another individual at 120% ('final_amount') of what he paid. Condition 4: We must determine the final amount received relative to the initial (original) price expressed as a percentage, which represents the overall percent reduction achieved through both sales events combined. This results in comparing two successive reductions - first when Mr. Rogers decreased the price to sell it himself and second when someone else reduced the already lower price further upon acquiring it.
