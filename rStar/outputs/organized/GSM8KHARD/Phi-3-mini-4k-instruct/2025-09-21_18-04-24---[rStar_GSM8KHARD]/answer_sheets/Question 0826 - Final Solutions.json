However, taking another condition we know \u2013 every child gets either one apple(Condition B), orange(Condition C), banana(Condition D), strawberry juice(Condition E). This suggests these items aren't part of their initial food share but something extra provided along with those shares. As such, since this doesn't affect our calculations directly regarding egg quantities; hence it remains valid under all previously considered situations whether other snacks like apples, bananas etc., come alongside. Therefore concluding based upon above facts statement holds true irrespective if Constraint A applies limiting individual sharing to not exceed \u2018n+k%\u2019 threshold value due to its specificity being irrelevant here because no explicit constraint was imposed concerning quantity limits apart form Equal Distribution Rule already established within Statement itself ensuring fairness regardless off additional rules related only further refine what kind fruits can go together rather than changing base numbers themselves.
