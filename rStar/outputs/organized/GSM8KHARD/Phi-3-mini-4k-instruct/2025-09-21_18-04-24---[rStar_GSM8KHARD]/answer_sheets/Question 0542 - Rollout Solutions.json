Since each pack costs $1474391, for 3 packs it would cost him 3 times as much which is 1474391*3= $4423173. Next we calculate the value of individual high priced cards ($4000+$1000) so their combined price equals $5000. Finally we need to determine the amount made off selling all other lower valued (but still valuable) ones; since these consistently sold well over time our best estimate was about halfway upward towards higher quality collectibles meaning approximately doubled per piece compared against the first batches purchased earlier. To get this figure I used simple multiplication techniques instead using averages because real world data tends not always follow neat mathematical patterns especially when dealing w/ something like financial transactions involving varying degrees & types across multiple assets within different categories etc... Multiplying one third portion multiplied again makes sense here due its large sample size making accurate estimates even harder otherwise!
