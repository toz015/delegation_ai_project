This discrepancy challenges pure objectivity since universal applicability becomes questionable due to unique local expressions embedded within broader categories universally acknowledged yet individually experienced differently around the globe.\n\n2. **Subjectivity Embodied Within Data Collection Processes**: While aiming for impartial observation, gathering information itself involves decisions which could unintentionally embed biases reflective of collectors'", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Let\u2019s use algebra again here.
