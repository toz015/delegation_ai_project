Question: Determine the value attributed to Skyler's portion of the financial input towards the shared saving endeavor. Original Answer: \\[x = \\text{(total) } - (\\frac{\\frac{2}{5}}{\\} x + \\frac{2}{3}(\\text{remaining}))\\]This equation simplifies stepwise:\\[\\begin{align*} x & = (9065135) - ((2)(9065135)/(5))\\\\& \\\\ &= (9065135)-(3626054)\\\\&=5439081\\end{align*}\\][Calculator Usage Instructions]\\[Skyler~invests~\\$5439081.\\] To clarify why we didn't directly calculate \\(1-\\frac{7}{15}\\), let us consider it through steps involving fractions only. Originally you wrote: \\[\\begin{cases}& f=\\frac{2}{5}\\\\&\\text {Remaining}=f+r=\\frac{3}{5};\\\\&fr=\\frac{2}{3},\\;r=c(\\frac{3}{5})\\;,\\;\\frac{rc}{\\frac{2}{3}}=\\frac{5}{2},\\\\&c=\\frac{5}{2}r,\\\\&c+\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{15}{5}.\\end{cases}\\]Herein lies our error! By multiplying both sides against denominators on either side, say across numerator and denominator respectively, gives incorrect results because one must multiply corresponding terms exclusively\u2014not mix different fractional parts arbitrarily during calculations. For example:If I wanted just two equations without using ratios or percentages but still utilizing subtraction within division boundaries such expressions could look like so where d stands instead o term \"denominator\": $$\\begin{aligned}(a-b)+cd=(a-(bc))\\Rightarrow cd=-bd\\; .\\end{aligned}$$ This ensures maintain uniformity while adhering", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Is my calculation method correct when determining how much skyler invested based upon the provided data points about contributions made via ratio divisions amongst contributors?
