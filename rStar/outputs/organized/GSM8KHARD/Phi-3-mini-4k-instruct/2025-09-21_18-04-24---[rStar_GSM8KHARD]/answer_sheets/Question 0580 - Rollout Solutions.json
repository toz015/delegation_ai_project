Here\u2019s what would generally happen under typical circumstances assuming \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d typically last around 2 minutes when sung solo which might vary depending on performance style & dynamics etc.: Firstly identify known values (number of performances), Secondly apply appropriate mathematical operations (+,-,*).
