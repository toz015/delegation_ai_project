According to the problem statement, we can set up the following equation based on the information provided: J = 2(J - 5), which means 'Jerry\u2019s present age equals double what it was 5 years back'. Solving for J yields : J= 2*(-5)+ 10 => J = 10. Therefore currently, Jerry is 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be three years hence i.e., in future add these 3 years into his current age; therefore, Jerry will be 10+3 = 13 years old. Thus, according to our calculation, Jerry will turn 13 years old in another three years time. However upon checking my solution against your initial hint I noticed a minor mistake in forming equations. This error affected both parts when calculating Jerry's past & future ages but not while determining whether or not Jerry could ever become zero due to negative values involved suggesting incorrect calculations elsewhere too!
