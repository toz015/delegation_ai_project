Firstly, let's calculate how much hay a single sheep would eat. We know that if a goat consumes 5 pounds of hay every week, then a sheep would consume 'three pounds less than twice' that amount i.e., 2 * 5 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds/week.  \nNext, since you mentioned there are 15 goats who all share their hay equally among themselves; hence each goat still gets about half our previously stated figure because not only them but also the sheep count towards sharing available resources\u2014resultantly reducing individual consumption requirements for both species slightly over time due to resource division amongst larger animal populations typically found within grazing fields like these.
