Start off with condition one; we know about 2360165 people voted initially before 8AM but you want us only consider those who didn't vote yet i.e., Initially no one has cast their votes so all remaining ones can still go through the process which means our starting point would remain same till midday when first fraction applies. Let\u2019s call it 'X'. This group includes both morning folks ('M') and latecomers ('L'). Since half turnout happens by midday, out of M & L together let say Y(where y <= X).
