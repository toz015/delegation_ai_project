Please provide the solution immediately following my prompt; ensure it aligns precisely with the provided data points including calculation steps underlined or bolded within brackets [ ] for clarity]. The detailed calculations must reflect accuracy down to exact numerical precision, avoidance of approximated values unless strictly unavoidable due to inherent decimal representations such as currency denominations which permit rounding up/down.
