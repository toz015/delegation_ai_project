Since it was mentioned that only half of the students (that makes up around ~50%) chose blue as their favourite colour; therefore approximately about ^(1/2)th or simply Half of all the children didn't select 'blue'. Given no specific value for Total Number of Pupils is available so let us represent them symbolically using Tau (\u03c4).
