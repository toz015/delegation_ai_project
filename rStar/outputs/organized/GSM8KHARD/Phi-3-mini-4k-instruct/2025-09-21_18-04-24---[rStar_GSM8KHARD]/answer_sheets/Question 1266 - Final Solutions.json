Condition 1:  The regular price of Tim\u2019s current cable service exceeds one million dollars (assumed as it states \"cable package\" which implies significant expense).

This means we cannot infer savings related solely to the costs detailed about individual apps like Netflix, Apple TV+, etc., since neither specific pricing nor bundle details beyond what was given on Netflix apply here due to insufficient data concerning other potential plans or memberships involved upon switching away from the supposed expensive existing cable provider.
