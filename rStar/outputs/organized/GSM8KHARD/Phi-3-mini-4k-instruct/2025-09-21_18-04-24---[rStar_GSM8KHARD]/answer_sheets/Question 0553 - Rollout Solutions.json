Since we know that every song plays back exactly once within its own respective playlist which means it only counts as part of time spent listening if played again or not replaced \u2013 this implies these same tracks could potentially replay multiple times throughout any period without increasing duration overall since no new unique content exists beyond their repetition points! Thus when calculating length/duration based off repeating patterns rather than fresh addition(i.e., \u201cnew\u201d material), you can assume constant lengths over repeated cycles until completion regardless whether certain items get used twice during listenings\u2014or even longer spans like weeks !
