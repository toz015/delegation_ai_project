Before this action took place we need to find out how much pie remained for him not yet consumed; that amount can be found as follows: Initial quantity \u2013 Quantity already used up [remaining] equals Total Pieces minus those gone away which results into being equal to Remaining Amount before Action taken Place three days ago i.e.:  2821391(Initial Pies)-[(Day_one)(used)/Total]*Piece count=Remaining[Before action]. This means it stands thus:(2821391-(1128556*2)/2821391)=2821391*(1-((2)*(1128556))/(2821391)). Solving yields us having just about:  893733 slices still available at the time Thursday rolled around.
