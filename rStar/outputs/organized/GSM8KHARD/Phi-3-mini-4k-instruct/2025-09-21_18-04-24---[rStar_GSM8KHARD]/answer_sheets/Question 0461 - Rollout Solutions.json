Firstly we need to find out how many fish Darren caught since it was stated directly in relation to Naomi who caught 1850575 fish. It mentioned 'Darren caught 6 fewer than Naomi'. From which you can easily deduce that if you subtract 6 (the amount missed) from what Naomi managed, i.e., 1850575 minus six equals 1850575 - 6 equalling 1850575 - 6 which results into 1850571. This means Darren caught 1850571 fish. Secondly, Tomasito or Tommy as referred to here captured three additional fish compared to Darren whose count stands at 1850571 plus those extra three captures would mean adding them together yielding; 1850571+3= 1850574.
