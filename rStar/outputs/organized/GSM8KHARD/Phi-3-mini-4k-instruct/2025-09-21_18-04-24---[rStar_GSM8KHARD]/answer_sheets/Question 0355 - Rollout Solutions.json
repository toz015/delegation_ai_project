compromised nor distorted erroneously thereby potentially misleading judgments regarding said subject matter concerned specifically albeit generalized approach might suggest simplicity rather complex realities often encountered practically necessitating detailed analysis considering potential variables such weather condition fluctuation rates affecting terrain topography alterations consequently resulting shifts directional vector magnitude gradients etc however ignoring those considerations present yet evident discrepancies between actual versus theoretical outcomes highlighted above nonetheless continuing forward whilst keeping track accordingly following established formulas calculating exact timings expressed primarily against specific instances illustrated below :    In terms
