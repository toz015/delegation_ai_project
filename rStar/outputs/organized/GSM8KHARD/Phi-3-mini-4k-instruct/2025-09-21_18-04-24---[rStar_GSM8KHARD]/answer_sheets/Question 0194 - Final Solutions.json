Here we go! Based off our stated facts you first require calculating both the fee charged per unit sold as well as one percent worth of transfers imposed upon said transaction... As mentioned previously these factors comprise separate entities thus calculations ought not overlap themselves nor intermingle together during their computation process.... Let me break down this equation into smaller sections so it can better serve your understanding purposes regarding its complexity!... We shall begin by taking apart component parts individually before attempting combinations thereof.. This methodology assists greatly when dealing wiith multiple variables involved simultaneously due simply being able visualize them separately rather than viewing everything collectively..... First things first however\u2014you want totals calculated priorhand just like mine ;).. I believe something along those lines would make sense\u2026 It appears most logical but lets see whether others agree accordingly.:(", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
