Hence it equals ($100*5)+$700= $500+$700=$1200 per tickets. Since we don't know yet whether multiple tickets or just one was bought so let's call Tickets Cost x hence Total Travel Expense becomes x+Cost_of_Suits(which you already calculated) i.e.,x+600$. And since these expenses (including savings) cannot exceed budget then traveling expense plus saved money can not cross over Budget($3721399). Therefore putting those into inequality expression above yields : $$\u2264$$3721399-$2000.$$x+600.$|$\u2265$-$2000.-$3721399.= $-3701399.<~=-<~$Thus range of possible value of variable 'TickeStkcktsCost'(i.e.TravelExpense ) lies below minus infinity upto ~(-\u221e,-37013"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Firstly, calculate the amount spent on purchasing the six business suits; That would equal 6*$100$, which results in $600.

This brings down the remaining balance before any other considerations to $(3721399 - 600 - 150)$.
