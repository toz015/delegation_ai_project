Firstly, convert dozens into individual units since we need it as single unit count. One dozen equals 12 items so four dozen would equal 4*12=48 eggs (from cases). Add this value together with the extra 2 loosely placed eggs which makes up 48+2=50 eggs. Each glass requires 5 eggs therefore if all these eggs make enough amount for one full round or cycle you get exactly 50/5 cycles because every fifth item goes towards filling up one complete set i.e., group hence only whole numbers matter here otherwise its not possible .
