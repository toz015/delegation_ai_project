This helps spread risk so that weakness in any single area doesn't disproportionately affect overall returns.

Therefore, assuming typical mistakes may include typographical errors leading us toward adjustments needed before proceeding properly \u2013 yet doing so demands assumptions devoid of clear base cases grounded firmly on described occurrences sans definite timelines linked specifically to interactions including trade volume measurements relating tangibly to individuals named Duncan and/or Adams across various temporal junctures.
