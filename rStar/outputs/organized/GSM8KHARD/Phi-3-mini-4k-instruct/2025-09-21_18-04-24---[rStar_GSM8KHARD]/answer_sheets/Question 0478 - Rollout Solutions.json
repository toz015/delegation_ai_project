It turns out such adjustment makes our purchase twice as heavy meaning effectively doubling the already inflated rate resulting directly causing equivalent consumption increasing quantity too.: New_unit_cost_due_to_higher_demand = original_price*(1+percentage_change)/2 Here, substitute known variables while calculating further => New_Unit_Cost_(New Coffee Brand)+Donuts = Weekly Consumption Price/(no.ofdays)*quantityperday+(donut_purchase); Substitute corresponding figures within equation=> New Unit Cost", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee.

Over one week, meaning across seven days, you spend roughly $45076297 just on coffee alone when using these premium brands daily (which equals about [$6439471]*[7]).

To add to these expenses, if we assume Roger purchased only one donut during shopping trip, its value stands as exactly $2.
