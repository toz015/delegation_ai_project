This leaves us with additional 2 remaining hours over the whole 4hr span dedicated solely towards Jack whose playtime doubled throughout while staying under those comparative limits set forth hence finishing just before anyone surpasses them leading me to conclude that no further increments could happen due to lack of available slots yet leaving ample unutilized periods equivalent to nearly  2 more full cycles of rounds clocked thereby equating almost precisely to equal division amongst our group members resulting into roughly speaking split down among ourselves even despite fluctuations being observed keeping overall distribution balanced fairly close enough without major deviances potentially affecting fairness significantly consequently ensuring continued equality upheld consistently regardless whether round startups varied", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A new arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.
