Here's the breakdown:\nFirst off, we know that Ray initially possessed 'x=24334553' lollipops. According to the information provided, Ray decided to retain a portion equivalent to 'y=4334553'. Thus when removing those retained lollipops from our original amount held by Ray ('total_lollipops'), we can use basic mathematical principles namely subtraction here which implies taking away y from x i.e., difference(result)=x-y . When you perform such operation : result=24334553-(4334553). You get 20000000 , thus establishing the base quantity available for distribution post deductive sharing. Next up comes another critical part called fairness principle implying no bias towards any party involved hence ensuring equitable dispersion.
