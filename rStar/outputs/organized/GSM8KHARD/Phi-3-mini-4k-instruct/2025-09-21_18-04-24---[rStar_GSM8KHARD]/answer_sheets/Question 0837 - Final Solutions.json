Following through further on our initial premise regarding Geb, who is stated to possess a decade younger status compared to exactly halfway point of Haley's age. Subtracting these ten units results in Geb having approximately three decades within their life stage. Therefore, according to your description about Geb being considerably young relative to Haley, Geb can thus deduced to be around 3 years old.
