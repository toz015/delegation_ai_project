Earnings(\\$) obtained equals $$49335060*$2=$98670120$$ Hence our desired resultant value comes up as $\\boxed{$98670120}$. This calculation assumes nonstop operation without any downtime or hiccups in manufacturing processes such disturbances often seen among industrial environments like machinery maintenance issues etc.. Additionally bear note companies may need resources allocation changes due shifts/changes brought forth by external forces including supply chain dynamics disruptions amongst others potentially impacting actual numbers thereby demanding updated calculations reflective real time scenarios whenever necessary!
