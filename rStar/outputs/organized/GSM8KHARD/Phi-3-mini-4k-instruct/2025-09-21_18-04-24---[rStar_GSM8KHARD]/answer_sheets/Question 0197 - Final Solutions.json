However, let's attempt simpler versions adapted accordingly.*Please note**that even though I cannot compute extremely complex mathematical expressions directly, we could work through simple illustrative examples related to probability concepts connected to permutations and arrangements herein presented\u2014but keep in mind real world applications may vary significantly once considering practical factors often involved in counting games scenarios! So consider our discussion purely theoretical explorations intended mainly towards understanding underlying principles behind various types of arrangement possibilities mathematically speaking :) Here goes an example inspired loosely upon request mentioned earlier :---Example Problem Statement :*A math teacher creates puzzles consisting of distinct shapes represented by letters(e.g., S=Sphere, C=Cube, etc.).
