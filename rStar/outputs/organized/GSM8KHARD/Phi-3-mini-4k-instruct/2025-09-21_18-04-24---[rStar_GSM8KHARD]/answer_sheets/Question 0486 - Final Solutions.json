To get enough material to create x=16 muffins, you will require an additional multiplication factor equal to x itself. Hence, calculating based upon requirements mentioned above, adding together amounts required makes us obtain following calculation pattern : Flour(tbps) -> Sugar(tbps) & Salt(tbps): Total_Ingredients*x ; where 'Total_Ingredients' denotes quantity used during production process of singular unit i.e., ONE MUFFIN . Substituting values accordingly leads to resultant solution being : Total Ingredient Required (tbps)= ((Flour+Sugar+Salt)*NumberOfMuffins); Where NumberOfMuffins represents our intended final product count e.g.; In present case scenario \u2013 No.ofmufFics=(16), hence substituting back obtained quantities provides results expressed hereunder , respectively:- FlourRequiredForFinalProduct(tbps)=((8397985+(3*16))*(16))=\u2248135384 Tablespoons,- SugarRequiredForFinalProduct(tbps)=((3)+(3*16))*(16)=~768 Tablespoons-,and finally :- SaltRequriedforfinalproduct(tbps)=(.28397985+(0.28397985*16))*(16)=~8 Tablespoons_.
