James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 1911581 friends on Facebook, how many Facebook friends does James have?", "ost_step": {"1": "Charlie has 1911581 friends which is three times as much as Dorothy so we need to divide this number by 3 (because she only has one third). We get that Dorothy has 637193.33 friends but since you can\u2019t really split up social media connections it means Dorothy actually has either less than or equal to what was obtained. Let us assume for simplicity sake here at least part of them having all real numbers . Therefore let's use floor division instead i.e., dividing without remainder resulting into integer output. This would imply that : charlie_friends / 3 = dorothy_friends -> int(charlie_friends/3) = dorothy_friends hence using integers implies that dorothy_friends=floor(charlie_friends/3)=int(charlie_friends/3)=int(1911581/3) = 637193 .
