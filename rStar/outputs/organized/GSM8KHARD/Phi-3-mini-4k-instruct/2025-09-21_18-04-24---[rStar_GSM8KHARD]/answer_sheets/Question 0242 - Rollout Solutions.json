Thus, assuming no other changes or transactions took place regarding these candies during our period under consideration, when it comes down solely to sharing among themselves while receiving neither others nor buying new stockpiles\u2014or indeed selling parts off their reserves either way--we simply retain whatever leftover quantity remains post distribution as seen here; hence leaving us precisely one hundred forty four thousand seven hundred sixty eight altogether still present within its confines ready available whenever needed next time around perhaps!
