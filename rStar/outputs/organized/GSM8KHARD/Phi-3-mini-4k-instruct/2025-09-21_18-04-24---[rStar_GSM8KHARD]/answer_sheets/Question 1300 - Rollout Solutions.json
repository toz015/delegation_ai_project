This results in a unit price of approximately $0.20/egg ($2.40 / 12). Next, determine the selling price (SP) using the provided figure. Since this seems like potentially incorrect or nonsensical data due to its lengthiness\u2014it suggests perhaps thousands upon thousands sold based on '8743034'. Assuming these numbers represent individual units being multiplied into groups but still adhering to standard numerical limits within our context, consider simplifying them as just \u2018$1.\u2019 Thus SP remains straightforwardly listed without further calculations because no specific quantity alteration appears needed here other than understanding what constitutes sales proceeds overall \u2013 which under normal circumstances wouldn't reach such absurd magnitudes if only whole quantities can reasonably exist when discussing physical items such as eggs.
