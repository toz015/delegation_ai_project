As per this provided text excerpt, it clearly mentions that both companies decided to collaborate post May 2016 which implies no prior relationship existed before them coming together as noted specifically mentioning November 2016 when Google partnered with Adidas but not until December 2016 when adidas made its announcement regarding working exclusively with Apple. Therefore we can conclude without doubt based solely upon these statements that neither company was partaking in any form or degree of shared business ventures during previous months leading up till October/November 2016. Consequently deducing such would involve making inferences beyond what exactly transpired here; thus rendering us unable accurately affirm if indeed \u2018they\u2019 (Adidas & Nike) actually held alliance commencement dates within timelines closer than later occurring events involving other brands like mentioned earlier pairings along same year timeframe under discussion about forming new ones etc..
