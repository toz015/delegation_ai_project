However, variations could occur if the rate of movement varies significantly compared to normal practices yet still remains consistent overall when combined into calculated totals covering entire evaluation periods taking note also of simultaneous group dynamics affecting single entity behaviors likewise possibly modulated contingencies around multi-individual scenarios employing communal PPE provision schemes despite distinct operational modalities inclusive diverse accord structures delimiting requisites exclusive rights allocations synchronicity assurances preserving continuity operations culminating definitive procedural execution.
