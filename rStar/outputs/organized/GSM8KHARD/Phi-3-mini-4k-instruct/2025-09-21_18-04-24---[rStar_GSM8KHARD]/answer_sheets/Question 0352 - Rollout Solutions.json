They needed to raise $4633489 for the two of them. By 3 pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. How much more did they need to earn to reach their goal?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Firstly let's add up what both friends have already earned together which would be $83 (keegan) plus $91 (tasha), so altogether it equals $83 + $91 = $174. To find out how much still needs to be raised we subtract this amount ($174) from our target figure ($4633489). This calculation becomes; $4633489 \u2013 $174 = $4633315. Hence, they still need to collect another $4633315 towards reaching their objective. The answer is: 4633315.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
