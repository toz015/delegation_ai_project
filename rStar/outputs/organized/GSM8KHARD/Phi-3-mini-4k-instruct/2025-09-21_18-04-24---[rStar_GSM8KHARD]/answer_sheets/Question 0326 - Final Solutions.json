single batch sizes served using these supplies if all provisions need to last equally without being surplus but also fully covering no instance of partial provision allocation disallowng wastefulness?", "subanswer": {"text": "Firstly let us calculate out what amount constitutes our supply quantities according to condition 1 : We have 4*dozen i.e.,48 plus 2 additional singles so altogether this amounts up too 50 units(assuming unit value per egg could range anywhere starting form 1 till n depending again largely dependent over various factors involving quality etc.) As stated earlier ,each full sized serving requires approx .half big enough yolk therefore taking into account said conversion approximations ;it means every pair can furnish equal halves thus enabling even distribution while conserving any remainder thereby eliminating wastage completely.(Note:Even fractions like quarter portions wouldn't make sense considering them due mainly having lack of appropriate container availability ) Henceforth lets conclude results yield maximum utility under provided constraints namely through making perfect pairs whilst ensuring optimum resource utilization leading directly onto calculation formula below :-Total Pairs possible= Total Units available / Unit quantity needed Per Serving SizePair Calculated=(no leftovers considered)(eggs count divided by doubled requirements)->i.e->Pairs Possible= 50/(2)= 25Batch Sizes covered entirely would come down precisely to twentyfive instances barring", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now consider
