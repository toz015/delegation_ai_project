Discuss potential challenges this might present and suggest ways forward while considering possible interventions designed according to principles consistent with scientific inquiry such as reproducibility and falsifiability. Consider discussing also what makes one approach stronger than another regarding inferences drawn under conditions like scarcity and variability of data.
