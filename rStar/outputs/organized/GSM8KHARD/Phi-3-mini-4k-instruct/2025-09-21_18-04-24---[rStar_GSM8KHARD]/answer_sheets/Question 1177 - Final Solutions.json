First off, you mentioned the goal was 'to find out how many males would need to attend'. Given that already existing dynamics require us to understand past distributions before moving forward, I see three main prompts embedded within your inquiry related mainly to mathematics rather than direct computation. Here goes:\n\nPrompt One : You asked essentially whether the same amount remains necessary assuming only factors like age aren't considered anymore whereas variables including race don't play any role either. This hints at trying to analyze a scenario without introducing bias due to racial categories when calculating expected participants \u2014 ideally retaining original values calculated purely around ages & capacities instead of further segregating them via ethnic lines etc., unless absolutely required otherwise depending on context circumstances beyond current discussion parameters .
