Your confusion seems rooted in mixing up these distinct processes\u2014exponential decay represented as halving values repeatedly and general exponential growth reaching twice their original amount once. These represent fundamentally different mathematical operations despite sharing terminologies (\"halved\" vs. \"double\"). Specifically, considering the hint provided, which focuses on achieving a fraction ('one half') transformation relative to the current form being multiplied, aligns perfectly with reducing something by half sequentially. This contrasts sharply with seeking quantities expanding till they reach precisely double (or multiply by 2 exactly once) against becoming fourfold or less than fifty thousandth part alluded to initially, pointing towards repetitive division by whole numbers beyond simple binary transformations.
