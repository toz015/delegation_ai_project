Assuming instead that 'each' refers to units of product sold rather than individual item count, here's revised calculation taking into account realistic basket capacities:\n\nFor example, suppose actual commercial practice includes buying cartons holding numerous dozen eggs\u2014common sizes might range upward of hundreds but never exceeding several thousand \u2014let us assume our corrected unit quantity was intended to represent tens of thousands thusly aligning logically within typical supply chain practices associated with food distribution enterprises \u2013 say perhaps \u2018each\u2019 indicates every ten thousandth batches processed en masse during operations over set periods throughout any sales cycle observed monthlong intervals amongst others operating similarly under corresponding market forces affecting consumer demand patterns impacting pricing strategies ultimately dictating profitability assessments accordingly adjusted according respective industry benchmark rates reflective prevailing local economic conditions etc..
