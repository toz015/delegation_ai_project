Rechecking our calculations or understanding could clarify potential misunderstandings here; but assuming these values make sense within contextual logic, subtracting them from the desired target might not yield meaningful results due to scale disparity, i.e., removal of thousands of heavier objects would likely approach closer proximity towards reducing cumulative mass needed rather than overshooting significantly via minor reductions through numerous low-mass components alone.
