Result:- Neds height equals three point five plus four inches (-3.5+4)*inch /one Foot.=One Feet.(1ft./Foot )Next up , finding Out carl's TallnessSince It mentioned above Carl being extra one foot higher compared to nad' sheight therefore ; Cars height(C_i)=(-3.5)+1.- Three Fifths Plus Four Inches (+4\")Inch .

Therefore, Carl possesses a measuring apparatus standing  3feet high.
