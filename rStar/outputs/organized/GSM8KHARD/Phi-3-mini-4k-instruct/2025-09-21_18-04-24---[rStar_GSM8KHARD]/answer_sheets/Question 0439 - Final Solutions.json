Here\u2019s how the new problem could be structured following your guidelines inspired by the previous examples, incorporating both 'multiple people involved', 'several variables leading to calculations over several stages,' and not directly naming characters like Mike ownerships ('dogs') versus another species ownership('cats'):", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "**Problem Setup & Initial Scenario Description:**  \nIn a quaint village lives three friends named Alexa, Blake, and Casey. Each friend celebrates birthdays exactly one week apart due to different time zones across which they live globally. At a recent gathering during one of them preparing gifts, it was noted that combined age totals precisely double the last digit found when multiplied together among all names mentioned\u2014these digits represent unique characteristics unrelated to numerical values. To add depth, everyone loves gardening and decided upon purchasing seeds proportional to half their current years plus ten additional units per decade lived since turning eighteen, minus twice the difference between their present year and nineteen eighty-five divided by sixteen thousand seventeen. As part of honoring tradition, every gardener plants only prime numbers of flower beds annually unless born under April, who opts out of this practice entirely until reaching forty years old.\n\nNow consider if someone observing their growth noticed that collectively before attaining majority status, no individual exceeded twenty standardized measurement lengths exclusive of fractions lesser than seven inches representing non-prime integers used herein \u2013 let us denote \u2018X\u2019 as the value", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
