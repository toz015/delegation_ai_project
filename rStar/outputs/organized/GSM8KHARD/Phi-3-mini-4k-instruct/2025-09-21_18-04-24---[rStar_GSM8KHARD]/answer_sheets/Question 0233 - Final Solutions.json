We know that we have 1742335 six member families which translates into \\(1742335 \\times 6\\) individuals making it equal to 10453990 individual slots available when no one gets missed. Moreover, three four person teams mean additional 12 (\\(3 \\times 4\\)) spots thus bringing our calculation to a grand sum of \\(10453990 + 12\\) equalling exactly \\(10454002\\). However, since both scenarios stated events led to lower than intended results; namely 'Eight Guests Fall Ill', amounting to eight less seats being occupied, alongside a scenario stating \u2018another Quarter Could Not Make It Due To Other Engagements'. Assuming these latter represent similar instances across various categories leading towards nonattendance i.e., half ('quarter') coming under either category causing respective losses viz. ten percent representing them individually but combined meaning doubled consequences essentially leaving twelve fewer heads roundtable.
