Given this interpretation, throughout 6 weeks of physiotherapy, he makes exactly six treatments/visits, not twelve because even though he technically receives 12 separate doses or units through doubled daily regimen across the span of the whole period being considered here, logistically speaking, each appointment counts towards just one unit of service when considering payment terms commonplace in health care settings.
