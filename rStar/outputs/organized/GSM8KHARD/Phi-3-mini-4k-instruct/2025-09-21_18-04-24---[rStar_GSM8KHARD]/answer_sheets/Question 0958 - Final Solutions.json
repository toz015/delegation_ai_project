involves calculating changes in gross industrial/manufacturing enterprise results caused by altering product lines\u2014specifically converting truck manufacturing into storing items like grain bags inside containers known as silos.\n\nStep I: Original Daily Earnings vs Post-change Gross Production Volume & Price  \nUsing the information about original goods being 'tracks', which produce \"$10\" per item ('unit'), it becomes apparent that initially the business was generating '$1,000'. Once switch happened, replacement good became storage facilities containing around '$7,277,175' units priced at \"$220\" per container leading to estimated annual return ROI (\"return on investment\") pegged at \"'r'\"%.
