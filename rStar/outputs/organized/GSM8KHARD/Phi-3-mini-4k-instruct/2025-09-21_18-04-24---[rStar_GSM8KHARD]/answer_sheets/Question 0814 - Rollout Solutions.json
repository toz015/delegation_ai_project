Since we know that Rani discovered the fastest car is 1.25 times as fast as the second fastest car, this means if 'x' represents the velocity of the second slowest car; hence the velocity ('y') of the second fastest would equate to `y= 1.25*x`. We also understand that the second fastest vehicle moves 5 times quicker than an ordinary automobile which travels at a rate (`z`) of 120 miles/hour. Hence, translating these relationships into equations yields: y=(1.25)*(5*z)=6.25*z. Substituting z\u2019s known numerical equivalent results in y=`6.25*`(`120`miles/hour), yielding approximately `750`mph as the topmost car's velocity.
