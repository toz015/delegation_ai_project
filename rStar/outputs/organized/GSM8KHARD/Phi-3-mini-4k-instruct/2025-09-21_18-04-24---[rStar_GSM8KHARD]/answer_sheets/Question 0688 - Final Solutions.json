{"text": "To solve this complex problem involving calculating joint totals considering additional elements introduced due to brother participation, we need to break down the instructions into manageable parts following hints mentioned. However, since explicit values for most variables aren't given other than initial inputs about players performing actions like spelling long word lists repeatedly, it leads us back to basics \u2013 understanding basic concepts associated with arithmetic operations especially multiplication and addition relevant to our scenario. This seems more related to counting tasks rather than traditional calculations found typically in algebraic expressions but nevertheless can still utilize core mathematical fundamentals needed to approach solution. Here's the simplified concept derived form instruction alongwith applying hint details accordingly:-  \nStart by defining variable `N` as the calculated value using formula presented i.e., `Number_of_Round*`Word_Length`, referred to as \u2018Collector Player", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
