Luke ate 2 hot dogs; since John ate half what Thomas did (who consumed thrice as many), then John ate one third of those same number. Thus, if 't' represents Thomas\u2019 count, then t=Luke*3 wherein \u2018t\u2019 stands for triple the quantity Luke indulged himself upon, thus translating to \u2018t\u2019 being equal to Lucy multiplied by thirty ((2)*(3)=6). Consequently, when determining what portion John ingested relative to Tom \u2013 simply halve \u2018t,\u2019 i.e., divide fifteen (.((6)/2)). Henceforth, from these computations derived above, clearly indicates Thadamons consumption surpasses Jonathan but not Lucas due to latter having partaken smaller share within said meal session resulting in conclusion drawn about discrepancy existing solely amongst pair comprising individuals named Lukerud & Johnsen respectively.
