Since it was stated that the second child is two inches taller compared to the first; hence adding those extra inches makes him reach up to 72\" + 2\" = <<72+2=74>>74\u201d high. Similarly for the third kid being five inches lesser as opposed to his older brother implies subtracting these few inches which results into standing upright at just 74\" \u2013 5\" = <<74-5=69>>69\u201d. Lastly considering the youngest offspring who seems quite towering over others since he turns out thrice higher when comparing himself against his sibling number three would make him stand erect at 69\" plus additional three centimeters equating to ((69)+(3)) = 72 inches altogether..
