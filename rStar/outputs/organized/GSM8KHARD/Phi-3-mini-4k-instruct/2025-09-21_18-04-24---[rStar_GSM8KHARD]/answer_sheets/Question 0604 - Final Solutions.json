Here\u2019s how you could perform this calculation:\n\nFrom condition one, it states: \"The base service costs $7754471\" This amount includes the installation of mirrors, shelves, and a picture according to our hypothetical example. No mention was made of adding extra items besides possibly buying books later.\n\nCondition three clarifies that the company uses a model called \u2018Standard Package + Per Item Charge.\u2019 Since nothing else but perhaps reading materials are purchased (\"Furniture\"), let us focus on whether anything gets factored in addition to the basics covered by the original quote ($7754471) \u2013 looking closely since none were initially indicated. Books aren't usually considered fixtures so wouldn't require professional handling. Therefore, assuming traditional book procurement isn't mandatory and doesn't fall within \u201cstandard\u201d definitions often used colloquially for decorum purposes ('books'), they shouldn't factor into the quoted rate.
