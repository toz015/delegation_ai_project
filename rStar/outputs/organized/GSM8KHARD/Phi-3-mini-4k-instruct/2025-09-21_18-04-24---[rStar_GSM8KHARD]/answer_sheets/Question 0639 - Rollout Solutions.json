Firstly, we need to find out how many marbles Paul had before he lost any. Initially, Paul had 52 marbles. When his friend gave him additional marbles, it made up to (52+1476799)=1476851. Since he lost one fourth of them means subtracting away three quarters(or multiplying) by .75 which results into (.75*1476851=1107638). Subtract this quantity from original amount i.e.,  1476851-(1107638)=369213. Therefore , Paul was finally left with 369213 marbles.
