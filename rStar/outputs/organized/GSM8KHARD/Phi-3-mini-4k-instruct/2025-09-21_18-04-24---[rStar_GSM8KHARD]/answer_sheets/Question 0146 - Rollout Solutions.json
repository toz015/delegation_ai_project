With a 10-acre farmland, this equates to 5*10 = <<5*10=50>>50 tons of grapes annually. Every ton translates to producing 2 bottles/barrels so, multiplying through; hence, obtaining 50*2 =<<50*2=100>>100 barrels of wine can potentially come from the entirety of Josie's land in a good year when conditions align perfectly. Therefore, Josie might expect around 100 barrels annually depending on environmental variables amongst others not considered initially which may alter actual outcome slightly deviating further away from idealized figures calculated previously.
