Firstly we need to calculate the overall expense which includes both the jacket and shoe purchases.

Assuming it means '$260', here\u2019s what you would typically follow:\n\nStep 1: Determine the price of just one pair of shoes: Given correctly, I believe it's supposed to read $260 ($x). We multiply this value by 2 because Sara wishes to purchase two pairs. Therefore, the total spent on shoes equals $260 multiplied by 2, resulting in $520.\n\nStep 2: Add up all necessary spending including the jacket: To get the full sum Sara needs, add together the prices for the jacket and the totals calculated earlier\u2014for two pairs of shoes. Thus, adding these values results in $30(jacket)+$520(shoes), equalling a grand total of $550.
