Condition 1:  The available soup fills up either four adult portions or eight smaller child portions. Condition 2: This quantity serves both Calvin (an adult) and his spouse as well as any potential other guests present, including multiple generations possibly defined by age groups such as 'adult', 'children'. Based on this data alone, we cannot accurately determine the precise ages required because it only mentions \"family members\" without specifying exactly who falls under which category; however, given common understanding about typical familial relationships\u2014it can generally assume parents would likely serve their own offspring when dining. We also don\u2019t know precisely what constitutes an \u2018adult.\u2019 However, assuming here \u201cCalvin\u201d represents just himself along with two adults \u2013 him plus mother/father - then within our constraints described earlier regarding portion sizes mentioned based solely upon provided details, those soups could cater adequately across seven servings maximum (either set size).
