Consider an office building where every third floor contains offices exclusively used by senior management personnel who do not work overtime nor require any meetings outside standard business hours. All other floors host regular employees whose workflow includes occasional weekend shifts and monthly team gatherings lasting up to three days. Each employee works five consecutive days followed by two off days throughout their career span but takes leave during national holidays unless they fall on Wednesdays, making those Thursdays instead part of vacation periods. Assuming all months begin on different weekdays starting January with Monday being the first day of both current year and next fiscal year, calculate how many full weeks will pass between the second occurrence of Friday falling exactly seven times consecutively across various rooms in room number eighty and its subsequent Saturday occurrences until December end. Additionally, consider these constraints: Employees using elevators arrive thrice as frequently on Mondays compared to Sundays post midnight. Senior managers avoid taking stairs entirely regardless of personal preference even though public facilities encourage physical activity among staff members by offering discounted gym accesses proportional to biweekly exercise participation averages calculated against logged entries exceeding fifteen sessions per semester.
