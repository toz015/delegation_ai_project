Answer provided based solely upon stated information about rates; hence no consideration made towards potential external factors influencing speed including possible fatigue effects over long periods).

Since both women contribute equally when doing tasks jointly, you would simply sum up what one woman could accomplish individually. This means Kalinda works through about four (4) parts while her mother contributes another two (2). Therefore, collectively, we find out these ladies handle six (6) sections within a single minute. Given such scenario, let us calculate how long they require to finish all seventy thousand eight hundred twenty-eight segments based upon the formula time taken equals quantity divided by speed or Time required(T)= Quantity divided by Speed . Thus T herein becomes equal to Seventy Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty-Eight Divided By Six which equates approximately One Forty Three Point Two Nine Minutes.

Condition 1: 706828 individual puzzle pieces must be assembled. Condition 2: Kalinda assembles parts at a speed of 4 pieces per minute. Condition 3: Her mother places twice the amount of puzzle pieces compared to what Kalinda usually adds but still less than her maximum pace of placing one piece per second (which would equal approximately 60 pieces per minute). Assuming both work continuously without any time taken off or overlap in tasks, calculate the duration required to finish building the entire puzzle expressed in terms of 'hours'. To solve this problem mathematically, we first find the combined assembly rate of Kalinda and her mother when working simultaneously. We know that Kalinda assembles pieces at a rate of 4 pieces/minute while her mother places double that effort minus whatever limits hers\u2014so let\u2019s assume that means just slightly less than two times faster since \"less\" implies not reaching full capacity which might affect accuracy.
