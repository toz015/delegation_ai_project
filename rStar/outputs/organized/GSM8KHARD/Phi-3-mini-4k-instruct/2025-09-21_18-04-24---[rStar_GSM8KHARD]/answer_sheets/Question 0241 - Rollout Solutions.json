Currently the battery level is at 60%, so you want to add another 40 percentage points since 100% - 60% equals 40%. Since charging occurs at 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, simply multiply those together; therefore, 40 times 3 equates to 120 minutes required to complete charging. To convert these into hours divide by 60 as one hour contains sixty minutes; thus, 120 divided by 60 results in 2 hours altogether.
