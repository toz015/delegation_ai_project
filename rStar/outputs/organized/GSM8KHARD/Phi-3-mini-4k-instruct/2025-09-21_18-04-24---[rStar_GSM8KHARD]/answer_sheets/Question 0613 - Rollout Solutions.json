Firstly, he spends $2 per squirt gun times 6 squirt guns which equals $2*6=$12. Secondly, when it comes to the water balloon packages, since one package costs him exactly as many as its serial number (i.e., $892187), so multiplying this price ($892187) by quantity (1) would yield same amount i.e., $892187 itself. Therefore, adding up these expenses yields us; $12(squirtguns)+$892187(waterballoons)=$892209$. Hence, subtracting our calculated value($892209$)from original balance which was $40$, gets us negative because our calculation shows that if all those transactions happened sequentially starting with no cash on hand initially, not only would there remain debt but moreover wouldn\u2019t exist enough funds even before considering purchase transaction related fees!", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
