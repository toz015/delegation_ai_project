Firstly we find out how many cups of water Ingrid consumes in 30 days. We know one cup contains (4295398) / (gallon). Therefore, if Ingrid drinks (8 * 30=) [eval(8*30)=240]cups over these thirty days; this translates into ((240/1)*(gallon))/(4295398)). To simplify further, divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor or use direct division since no units cancel here as implied error due to misunderstanding interpretation of 'cups'. It results in approximately equal amounting to [[(240)/(4295398)]]. Let\u2019s calculate it using correct values without considering any unit conversion errors first before rounding off appropriately depending upon significant figures required.
