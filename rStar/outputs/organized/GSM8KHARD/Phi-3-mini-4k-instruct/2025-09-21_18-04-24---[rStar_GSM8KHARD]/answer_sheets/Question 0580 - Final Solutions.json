Carrie wants them to perform \"Deck the Halls,\" which takes 150 seconds but happens twice so it\u2019s 150*2= 300 seconds. They also want to play \u201cJingle Bells,\u201d taking up another 240 seconds. Therefore we add both durations together; 300+240 equals a combined performance length of 540 seconds. But usually people measure these kinda times using minutes instead of just counting simple units like 'seconds'. To convert seconds into minutes you simply divide those seconds by 60 because one minute consists of sixty seconds. Thus, dividing our resultant amount i.e., 540/60 yields us 9 minutes. Hence, their complete caroling session including all three mentioned tracks amounts to roughly about 9 minutes if counted cumulatively without considering any breaks or intermissions. This assumes continuous playing without pauses during transitions between different tracks too!

Adding these together yields our solution. Therefore, Carrie's choir would spend around '300+240=540 seconds', translating into approximately twelve minutes if you divide this sum by sixty seconds since every minute consists of sixteen seconds.
