Let me clarify and complete our task based on the assumptions mentioned previously. We need to find out exactly what numerical value needs to be set into the oven (`OvenTemp_Corrected()`) so that it displays `450`, assuming the scaling behavior follows through consistently regardless of initial erroneous state being far greater than any reasonable expectation for such devices. Given the original scenario described\u2014and adhering strictly to algebra under these simplified premises\u2014we can extrapolate directly since no specific method detailing beyond basic arithmetic operations was articulated due to potential complexity involving advanced calibration factors not explicitly enumerated nor hinted upon.
