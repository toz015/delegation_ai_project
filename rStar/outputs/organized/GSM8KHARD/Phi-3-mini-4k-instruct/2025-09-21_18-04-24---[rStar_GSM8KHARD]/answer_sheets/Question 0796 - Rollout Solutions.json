How many miles did Ahito run?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Firstly find out the distance covered by Micah using multiplication operation (Micah_distance). Then subtract both distances from TotalDistance=52(to get) DistanceOfAhito.", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's break it down into steps. Amber ran 8 miles. To calculate Micah's running distance we multiply Amber\u2019s run by three point five i.e.,  8*3.5 which equals 28 miles. We know that all together their runs totaled up to 52 miles so if you subtract the summed mileage of Amber and Micah from this amount; thus leaving us only with Ahito\u2019s personal count. Therefore, calculating 52 minus (the combined numbers of Amber's and Micah's), results as follows:-   52-(8+28)=    52-36 resulting finally as     16 Miles .", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "So let's summarize these calculations one last time... You start off knowing Amber ran eight miles. Next, micah ran thirty-five percent or 'three point five' faster than amber meaning every miler multiplied seven twenty fourths would result in Mikel's individual speed rate per hour--or rather kilometer....so since mikl spent less hours going through sixteen kilometers while doing sixty kilometres over seventy years---that simply means mike was moving twice as fast!..but remember though our question isn`t about who went quickest but instead focused upon quantity\u2026however once calculated correctly its easy enough just divide twelve thousand meters divided evenly amongst those same persons involved hence making them equal shares thereby allowing everyone else too enjoy themselves equally also ensuring nobody gets hurt along side ourselves either way whether playing sports such football , basketball etc because no matter whose turn comes first always ensure safety precautions put place before anything happens otherwise risk severe injury/damages occurring against innocent civilians nearby due lackadaisical behaviour exhibited throughout humanity overall leading society members towards chaos caused solely based purely within ignorant bliss whilst living life carelessly without regard respectfully considering others importance above self interest therefore why", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
