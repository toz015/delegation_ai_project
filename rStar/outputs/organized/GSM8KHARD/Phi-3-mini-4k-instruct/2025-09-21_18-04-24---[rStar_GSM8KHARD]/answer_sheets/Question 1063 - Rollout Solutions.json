Therefore, George used to possess 3888090 + 5 = 3888100 candies before reducing them due to snack indulgence. Knowing that Oliver holds precisely twice the quantity compared to George pre-consumption provides valuable insight. Hence multiplying George's previous holdings by two equates to Olivers present stockpile i.e.,  2 * 3888100 yielding 7776200 candies accumulated presently under Nicholas' possession following Georgia's intake reduction activities.
