Condition 1:  For every page of books, it takes James 10/3 or approximately 3.33 minutes to finish one. Condition 2: The total amount of time spent on reading is equivalent to (total_pages * average_time) = ? Where 'average_time' signifies mean duration taken to complete a single page given initial condition. Substituting values leads us to compute ((2168550 * 3.33)/3). Therefore calculate this expression to find the required solution - Total Time Spent Reading By James Calculation : Let n represent \"number of seconds.\" First convert everything to units compatible with seconds since our unit conversion process requires consistency across measurements. We know that; t(seconds)=d(minutes)*60+r(remaining_seconds); d=9+(t*7); r=(t%60), where \"%\" stands as modulus operator returning remainder value when integer division executed, effectively mimicking clock behavior ignoring overflow past minute markings but keeping second increments within [0...59].
