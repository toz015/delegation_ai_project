people who came to the party using Condition 1. Since everyone gets one set of hot dogs according to Condition 2, we simply subtract the 4 spare hot dogs already owned by John from the total number of guests who arrived. Thus, if James purchased enough meatball subs for everybody except himself but forgot about it until later, recalculate how many pizzas John initially ordered so no one goes hungry yet keeping waste minimal Let's break down what happened first before calculating new figures.
