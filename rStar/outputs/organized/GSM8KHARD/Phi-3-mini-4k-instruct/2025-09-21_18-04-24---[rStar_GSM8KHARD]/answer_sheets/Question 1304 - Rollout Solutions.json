We start out representing donovan's time as 'x', since bethany spends 18 additional minutes over him, hers could be represented by '(x+18)'.

Subtracting 18 across makes things cleaner ---->   2x== 80 , Dividing throughout by Two -- > => x == 40 meaning donovan utilized four times ten seconds---equivalent to forty units/minutes------>So if Bethany used eighteen less ---->= 40 - 18 ==> Total Time Spent By Bethany Is Fifty Eight Minutes !!!
