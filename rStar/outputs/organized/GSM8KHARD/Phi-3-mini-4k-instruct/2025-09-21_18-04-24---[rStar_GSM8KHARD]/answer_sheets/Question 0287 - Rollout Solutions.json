Question: What is the value of Wilson\u2019s current mathematics course mark based on these given data points? Original Question: Jesse travelled East 18 miles then North 11 miles before stopping due to heavy fog. Calculate his displacement vector (magnitude) using trigonometry considering East direction as positive x axis and north as positive y axis. Rephrased Question: Provided certain known values - initial eastward movement equalling 18 miles and subsequent northern journey amounting to 11 miles; calculate the magnitude component |D| = sqrt((Eastwards_movement)^2 + (Northwards_movement)^2). This problem assumes linear motion along two orthogonal axes where 'x' represents the horizontal distance moved towards the right i.e., EASTWARD, while 'y' signifies vertical progression upwards denoted as NORTHWARD under standard Cartesian coordinates system conventions. Please keep note though that real world scenarios might deviate slightly owing to factors like wind speed alteration during the trip etc. Based on provided instructions, here goes... First off we know our movements can indeed be treated as vectors since both directions (east & north), although different, still adhere strictly to specified paths without any backtrackings involved. Herein lies importance of understanding key concepts related to Vector algebra particularly focusing upon Displacement which essentially denotes straight line path connecting starting point(origin O) & ending location irrespective of actual traversed route leading us directly from one position to another thereby negating influence exerted by intermediary waypoints ensued throughout said traverse period henceforth deemed irrelevant except when required otherwise within unique problems alike!
