Condition 3: Then, following this sudden appearance, 2 previously unseen tadpoles hide away behind a rock. Question: Based on these changes during his observations, what would be the current count of visible or concealed (but still present) tadpoles in the pond according to Finn\u2019s findings? Note however, any numbers provided as potential answers must strictly adhere to being whole integer values; fractional counts aren't plausible within realistic biological settings like those described herein.) To determine whether two events could occur simultaneously without violating either condition individually when neither event influences the other requires checking both scenarios independently first before combining the results since independence implies one doesn't affect the occurrence probability of the other. However, let us consider 'Alice plays basketball', which describes Event C occurring because it specifies Alice playing but not mentioning Coach Bob coaching explicitly. For Events B ('Coach Bob coaches') and D ('Event E occurs'), we know nothing about them directly tied to the main sentence\u2014it merely states something happening alongside whatever Event C entails. Without further details indicating causation or correlation, assuming mutual exclusivity allows considering both simultaneous possibilities where independent probabilities apply, thus satisfying overall requirement while maintaining individual integrity unless specified otherwise due to lack of explicit interdependence evidence.
