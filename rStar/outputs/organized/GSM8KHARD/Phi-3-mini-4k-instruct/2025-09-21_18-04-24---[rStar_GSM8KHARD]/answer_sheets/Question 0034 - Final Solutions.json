Condition 1:  The speed of Tom\u2019s boat when going away is 10 miles per hour (mph). Condition 2: His journey begins before 1 o'clock but ends around or exactly four o'clock pm . Condition 3: When returning home his speed decreases to only 6 mph.   Question: Considering the distance covered during both trips what would you say about this situation ? To solve this problem correctly we don't actually know the distances involved because neither time traveled nor specific times given imply any particular route length without further data such as exact departure and return timings within those intervals provided. However, assuming equal durations spent on both journeys since \"traveling\" implies continuous movement until reaching destination points; let 'd' represent one leg of the round trip where d = speed * time --> Time = Distance/Speed.<|end_of_document|> Since I cannot provide real calculations here due to missing concrete values like actual start & finish times, duration of each segment etc., imagine instead using variables based upon hypothetical scenarios which could apply generally - considering constant speeds throughout respective periods mentioned above including assumed timing details necessary for completing computations accordingly once available numbers fill gaps accurately representing said situations.
