Here goes:\n  \nWe define `d` as the common multiplier showing relative magnitude of travel on weekdays (`T`) versus weekend (`W`). Consequently, we obtain: \n    Weekday Distance `(TD)` : `Dt = 2dw`,  \nand    \n    Weekend Day Distance `(WD)` : `Dw = dw`.                              \n            \nNow lets denote `Y` as cumulative trip length during normal working hours beginning count time zero (a typical Monday morning).

Throughout the six working days or 'weekdays', if Pancho covers twenty kilometers every single day, it would result into him covering ten thousand meters four hundred times since there are fifty tens within those sixty thousands ('twenty kilometres').
