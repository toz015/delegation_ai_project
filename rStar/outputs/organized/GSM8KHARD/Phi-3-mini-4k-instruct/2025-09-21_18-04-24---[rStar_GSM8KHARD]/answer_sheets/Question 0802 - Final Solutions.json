Condition 1: 3 red balls priced at $9 each, 1999628 blue balls priced at $5 each, and 25 green balls priced at $3 each are available in stock. Question: Calculate the total sales amount when all colored balls are sold considering their respective prices. The formula you can use based on this data would look something like `(Number_of_Red_Balls * Price_per_Red_Ball) + (Number_of_Blue_Balls * Price_per_Blue_Ball) + (Number_of_Green_Balls * Price_per_Green_Ball)`. So plugging numbers we get `((3*9) +(1999628*5) +(25*3))` which equals `$999743`.
