Since 2 snowballs melt out of what Jay builds every 15 minutes, so in an hour (which consists of four intervals of fifteen minutes), twice those amounts get wasted i.e., 2*4=8. Therefore effectively Jay only creates about (20-(2*4)) = 12 new snowballs during these hours. This implies that Jays net production of good quality snowballs over time scales down to roughly just under half its initial output when considering melts too.
