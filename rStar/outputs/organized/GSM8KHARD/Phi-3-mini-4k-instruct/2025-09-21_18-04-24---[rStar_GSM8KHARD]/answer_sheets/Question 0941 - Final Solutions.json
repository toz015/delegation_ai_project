Unfortunately, formulating accurate predictions about animal behaviors requires detailed observational studies going far beyond mere mathematics and delves deep into fields of ethology (animal behaviour science). Without clear guidance pointing toward any pattern observable across different situations, attempting definitive answers becomes speculative despite applying rigorous logical thinking expected in technical domains like artificial intelligence models dealing with reinforcement learning aiming at capturing intricate sequences found in nature exhibited by living creatures facing dynamic environments often described mathematically utilising differential calculus methods combined with statistical analysis frameworks relying heavily on large scale empirical evidence gathered repeatedly collected observations compiled thoroughly analysed before proposing reliable theories explaining cause & effect relationships governing said dynamics whilst simultaneously being mindful limitations inherent associated research field itself along side its terminologies especially those terms 'models', 'predictions'.

Upon returning, Nate begins to refill them at a rate of 9 holes per day, leaving unfilled those previously excavated ones plus additional holes made each subsequent night. We need to establish this pattern iteratively or use algebraic representation due to its recursive nature involving daily hole creation without specifying exact durations beyond general calculations up till 'May'. This presents a complex problem likely requiring computational algorithms rather than manual math to resolve efficiently.
