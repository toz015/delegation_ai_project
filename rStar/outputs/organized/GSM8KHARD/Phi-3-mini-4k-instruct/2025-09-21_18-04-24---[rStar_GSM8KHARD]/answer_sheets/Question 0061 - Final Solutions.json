Let us start solving it using these hints provided below.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Number of Roses Per Bush Multiplied By Total Buses [Condition 1]\nWe know from condition 1 that each rosebush holds 25 flowers ('roses'). Given that there are 1390409 rose bushes, multiply them together to get the total number of roses:\nRoses_Total = RoseBushes*FlowersPerRose   -->   1390409*25 \u2248 34760225\nSo, approximately 34,760,225 roses grow around Mr.Dan's house according to this instruction. But keep note --this figure represents just counting the actual amount off any parts associated directly with the flower itself(rather than focusing primarily on other elements involved which shall come into play soon.).\n\nNote: Keep your intermediate answers precise until reaching the last calculation avoid rounding numbers early else errors may arise during complex computations involving large quantities/numbers leading towards incorrect ultimate outputs due lackadaisical handling", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
