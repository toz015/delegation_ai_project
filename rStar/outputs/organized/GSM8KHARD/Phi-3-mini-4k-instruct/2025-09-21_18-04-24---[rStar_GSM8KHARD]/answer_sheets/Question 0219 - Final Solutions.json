Adding this figure into our original calculation leaves us with approximately four thousand seven hundred fifty eighty six ninety one minus seventy seven point zero million thirty five eleven crates equals around negative twenty six million forty ten point nine fifteen crates indicating that Sam fell short of meeting his goal rather than exceeding it because none of those values reached their intended amounts nor met the required targets mentioned previously.(Note: Please understand that numbers like 'negative', '-' symbols aren't exactly used here but instead represented using textual phrases.)
