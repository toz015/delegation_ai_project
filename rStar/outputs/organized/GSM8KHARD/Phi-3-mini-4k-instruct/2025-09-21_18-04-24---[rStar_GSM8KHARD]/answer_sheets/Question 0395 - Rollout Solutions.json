Condition 1:  Normally, Emma makes up to 72 videos per month.

Based on such details presented about varying levels of output across successive periods or 'weeks', we would like you to establish whether it falls short of what could typically constitute her regular workload as indicated earlier (i.e., making approximately seventy-two videos).
