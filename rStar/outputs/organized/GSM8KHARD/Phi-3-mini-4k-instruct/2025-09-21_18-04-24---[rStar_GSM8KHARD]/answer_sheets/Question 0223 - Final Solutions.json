Hence resulting value equates approximately about $630 trillion or roughly equivalent to around six hundred billion USD($630e+9). But since question specifies 'very well', additional calculation needed as mentioned above; hence adding extra boost i.e., calculating sum including all individual values together plus their respective products using suitable arithmetic operations(`final_amount=$calculated_value+(bonus*no_of_days)`.
