Excluding their shared adventure fee per person or group member allows us to calculate individually how others may benefit financially. This brings down the adjusted sum available towards hiring minigolf players to $90 - $45 = $45 still untouched because none of its portion had been utilized yet within these specified boundaries; hence every participant gets free use over those resources since payments already accounted for don't subtract further when divvying up benefits amongst friends who come along separately during visits made jointly earlier mentioned!
