Since Luke ate 2 hotdogs and Thomas ate three times as many, we multiply 2 by 3 to get Thomas's total. That calculation results in \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) hotdogs. Next, because John ate half as many hotdogs as Thomas, we take Thomas's total which was six hotdogs and divide it by two (\\(\\frac{6}{2} = 3\\)). Therefore, John ate 3 hotdogs. Finally, to figure out how many more hotdogs John ate compared to Luke, subtract Luke's original 2 hotdogs from John's 3 hotdogs, leading us to conclude \\(3 - 2 = 1\\). However, this result contradicts information provided earlier indicating that John actually ate less than Luke, so reviewing my calculations reveals I made a mistake interpreting \u201chalf\u201d based only on Thomas's numbers rather considering overall totals including all participants involved in comparison against Luke directly initially intended.
