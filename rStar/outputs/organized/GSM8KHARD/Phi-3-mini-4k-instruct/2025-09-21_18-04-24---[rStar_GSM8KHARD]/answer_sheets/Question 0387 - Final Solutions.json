Here's a simplified version focusing solely on meeting these main goals efficiently:\n\nFor the Colorful Bulbs mentioned initially, assuming 'Colorful Bulbs' represent another type requiring pairing just like Tulsils, your calculation would focus primarily on finding pairs offsets so every package ends up completely spent rather than ending halfway through making them seem incomplete visually & functionally speaking!
