Firstly, it was mentioned that Olivia watched each film thrice (total viewing time). This implies 'no of shows', which here can also mean visits or instances someone went to watch a particular show/movie titled as well known examples such as Star Wars trilogy films etc.. Secondly, this frequency ('viewing') would impact our calculation because different tickets could possibly fetch varying prices depending upon their demand during specific periods like weekdays vs weekends holidays promotional events etc... Finally, if you consider only those scenarios when every person pays equal amounts irrespective whether its same seats across sessions but keeping up count based solely off individual attendance counts without additional conditions relating seating choice preference differences being considered within varied pricing scales affecting them due perhaps overlapping timing clashes thereby resulting into potential discount rates applying uniformly thus causing adjustments needed before concluding actual numbers arrived having accounted already taking care factors about seat choices making sure everyone gets treated fairly regardless any variations happening apart basic pay scale difference arising owing primarily mostly probably mainly almost entirely essentially strictly pretty much largely basically just generally speaking", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
