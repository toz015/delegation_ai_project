To find this amount, subtract the difference (23) from Boris\u2019 original count. This yields 5476985 \u2013 23 equals 5476962 apples which represents what Beck starts off with. Next you add ten apples since Boris transferred them into Beck\u2019s possession resulting in a new balance standing as follows; Boris(apples)=5476985-(10=5476975), Beck=(5476962+10)(which makes it equal to 5476972).
