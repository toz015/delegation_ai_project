Answer: In the last part you used multiplication instead of addition. You need to add up individual distances not multiply multiple values together.

Answer: In the last part you used multiplication instead of addition. You need to add up individual distances not multiply multiple values together. Here\u2019s what I recommend changing your calculation like below : First calculate 'initial_ride': initial_rides = average_miles_per_day * days ; Secondly get final result using both calculated variables above thus Final Distance Ridden=Initial+Final . Where Initial represents rided miles from previous step & Final represnts extra added milages due to reduction in frequency , here is corrected code snippet :- def calculateTotalDistanceRodeByMike(): # Define function parameters numTripsPerWeekForFirstPeriod = 5 # Number of trial runs per period in first phase hoursInEachTrialRunBefore = 25# Miles traveled within one trail run hourOfTravelInSecondPhaseOrAfterward = 60 # Hours Of Trail Run Per Week Before second Phase WeeksPriorToSwitchover = 4 # No.o of weeks prior switch To Second Trial Period TotalWeeksHadBeenTrialRunningOnBikes = 7 # Overall no.
