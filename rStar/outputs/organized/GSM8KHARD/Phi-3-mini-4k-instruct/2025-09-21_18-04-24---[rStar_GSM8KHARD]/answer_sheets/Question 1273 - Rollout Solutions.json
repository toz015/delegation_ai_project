We can say that 'Ea' represents the amount of enemies defeated by Ava (their original variable was incorrect as it conflicts), 'Eb' would equal Eb+3 or three greater than whatever emma gets since ava gains three extra points per Enemy because eb=e. Also let Tbe equals b/t(timing) minus four due to ava being slow compared to Emmas timing; This also means Tba=. Since both girls earn additional bonus time according to this question I feel like its safe to assume neither girl won so if you wanted them to win something about speed could change my equation around here but i kept things simple.\r\n\r\nNext lets figure out just point totals without taking into account any bonuses earned through finishing levels faster vs ones not finished within said duration all together which happens quite often anyway especially during testing phases etc.. Point System Equation below shows only those components necessary including multiplier factors used against base values assigned beforehand using integers instead decimals while still getting full accuracy required throughout entirety regardless whether someone takes longer periods outside normal boundaries defined earlier mentioned thus far...
