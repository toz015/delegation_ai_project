We know it takes her 16 seconds to travel 20 feet. That means she covers one foot (20 / 16) which equals approximately 1.25 feet per second. Since the distance to shore is 64 seconds long, this would mean she traveled around (64 secs * 1.25 fps), so about 80 feet toward the shore when considering speed alone without any additional variables affecting such as currents or obstacles.\nNext, let us determine how quickly the boat fills up using our knowledge concerning its rate; i.e., absorbs 9375033 Litres per each set of 10 feet moved backwards until reaching safety point. Thus, if moving forward doesn't change this fill factor directly but assuming other conditions remain unchanged except movement direction relative to danger zone boundary line, you might infer similar displacement effects regardless whether being pushed further into danger zones due to backing off or progressively increasing survival risk levels correlated proportionately tied to increased exposure duration within hazardous area boundaries.
