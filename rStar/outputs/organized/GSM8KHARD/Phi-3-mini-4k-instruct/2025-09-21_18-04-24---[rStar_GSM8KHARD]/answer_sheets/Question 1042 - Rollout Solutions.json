First, we know that currently, Harriet is 21 years old.

That would mean Adrian is also aged 63 since 21*3=63. As suggested, the question doesn't require us to calculate anything about someone named Zack so we can ignore him entirely when considering averages here. We only care about these three people--Harriet, Adrian and ourselves who exist independently of anyone else introduced later.
