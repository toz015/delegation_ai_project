Using basic algebra principles, you divide the total distances traveled over the set period of time i.e.: Time = Distance / Speed [T=D/V]. Substituting D(distance) =1200miles into equation T=(1200)/(Speed), also replacing V=Distance Covered per Hour = Total Miles Travelled divided by Total Hours taken equals (=1200/3)=400 mph . Thus substituting these figures back onto our original expression yields :Time taken to cover one Mile would equate to [(Total hrs)(Distance traveled)]/(total miles).
