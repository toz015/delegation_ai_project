We know that Arianna plans to plant 146264040 individual flowers since there are 7313202 rows and 20 flowers per row, resulting in a product of multiplication equal to the initial quantity intended before accounting for non-blooming factors. Given that currently, only 4/5th, representing 80%, of these meticulously cultivated florals successfully bloom, we multiply the entirety figure\u2014146264040\u2014with the fraction defining success rate expressed as decimal equivalent .8 (since one fourth equals 0.25). Thus obtaining 146264040 multiplied by .8 yields precisely 117011232 fully grown and radiant specimens within Arianna's botanical domain showcasing nature's miraculous cycle fulfilled under nurturing guardianship fostering beauty across its sprawling canvas adding splendorful touches onto Earth's grand stage adornment serving human appreciation alongside sustaining biodiversity balance essential for planetary wellness preservation harmonizing coex", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Arianna plants a garden that has 7313202 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row.
