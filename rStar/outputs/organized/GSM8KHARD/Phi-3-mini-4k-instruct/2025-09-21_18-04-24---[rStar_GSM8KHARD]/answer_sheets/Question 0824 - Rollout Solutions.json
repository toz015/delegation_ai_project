First off, we need to determine how many red jellybeans there are. We know that there are twice as many red jellybeans as there are green ones.

Next, add up the quantities of both the red and green jellybeans together: Red and Green combined (R+G) would equal 318,426 + 159,213 which totals 477,639 jellybeans.
