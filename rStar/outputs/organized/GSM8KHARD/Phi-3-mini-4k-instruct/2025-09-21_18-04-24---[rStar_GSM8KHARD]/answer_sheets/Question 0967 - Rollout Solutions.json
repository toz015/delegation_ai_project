Answer 5.1: Let brad_received be the dollar amount Brady receives. Then Jeff receives 4*brad_received because Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Since the total amount is $100, we have the equation brad_received + 4*brad_received = 100. Combining like terms, we get 5*brad_received = 100. Dividing both sides by 5, we find brad_received = 20.
