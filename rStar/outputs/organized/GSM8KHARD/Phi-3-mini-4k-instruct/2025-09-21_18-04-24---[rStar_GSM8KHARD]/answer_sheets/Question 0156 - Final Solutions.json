Here's how you can work through this problem step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate Total Interest Due\nSince she needs to add 10% as interest to the original sum ($2000) because of the contractual agreement, let\u2019s find out how much extra she would owe beyond just returning the principal. This calculation would look like so: Principal Amount * Percentage Over Base / Conversion Rate -> Resulting Additional Payment Needed. Substituting numbers into our formula yields $(2000*10%)/.10 => $200$. Thus, adding another $200$ makes up the full value including the agreed upon increase which totals back again becomes `$2200` overall.
