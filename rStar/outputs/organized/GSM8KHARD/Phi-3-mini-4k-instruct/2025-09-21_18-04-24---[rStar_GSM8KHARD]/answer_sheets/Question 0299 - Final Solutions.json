That means once every three months, which equates to three quarters of a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, these would occur twice (the third and sixth months) plus another instance if you include partial years into consideration. However, since it specifies 'traditional seven-day period,' let us assume all instances fall perfectly onto full weeks beginning new week counts starting January first. Thus, those who follow strict interpretation might consider only complete biweekly segments occurring fully in sync with Jan/Feb start dates \u2013 leaving February entirely outside because no part aligns with Feb ends.\nSo overall calculation becomes [(1*2)+(1*1)]=3 sixes worked but counting also requires adjustment taking leap years (+1), so actual count may vary slightly depending on your base date choice & whether current_year falls behind before March 1st [a typical convention adopted]. But sticking closely enough using original wording implies clear guidance suggests focusing primarily around whole numbers less emphasis placed especially heavily regarding fractional elements like remainder days scattered irregularly amongst even distribution premised largely centered pivot point midpoints anchored principally origin sequence itself", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
