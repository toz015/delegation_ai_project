We need to calculate how many voyages take place till less than 5% (which represents almost full utilisation) of the population goes away. From the scenario description, I understand roughly similar interpretative logic applied means subtracting set groups sequentially based on daily trips made reducing proportionately towards non-voyage states assuming direct proportional reduction. Herein lie crucial factors causing significant differences leading directly impacting calculations hence further explanation detailed below follows precise interpretation whilst observing stated prerequisites intact..
