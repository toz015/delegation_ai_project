Condition 1: 10-foot sections of a specific type of redwood tree usually weigh about 400 pounds when untouched by pests or damage. Condition 2: An infestation caused termites to eat away 30% of one particular 200-feet tall redwood tree. Since the weight reduction would occur proportionally across its height, which originally supports four such ten-foot segments (each being affected evenly), calculate the current approximate overall weight considering only full-length sections above ground level still intact. Assume any part below ground remains unaffected as well since roots also contribute significantly to initial mass but not uniformly due to varying root structure depth. Question: Considering just the visible portions without accounting for subterranean support structures like deepening root systems, what could likely represent the estimated present-day gross weight of said segmental portion assuming consistent material distribution throughout both visualized upper trunk sections retained post-infestation and baseline average density/composition persistence despite partial defoliation?
