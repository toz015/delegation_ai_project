First off, let us understand that when you add fractions having different denominators such as 1/4 and 1/2, you first convert them so they share common terms before adding. We could say instead of saying 'half plus fourth', it would make sense to look at \u2018two twelfths addition four twelfths'. It makes things easier because these become comparable units since twelve shares its value evenly among itself thus making calculations easy and straightforward without involving complex operations later during computations.
