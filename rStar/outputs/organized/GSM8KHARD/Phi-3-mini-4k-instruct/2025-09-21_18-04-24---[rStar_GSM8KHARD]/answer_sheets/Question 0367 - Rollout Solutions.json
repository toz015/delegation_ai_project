Here\u2019s our detailed breakdown:\n\n**Step 1: Convert Fraction Amounts to Actual Lengths**\nMariah used 1/4 of a skein; therefore, multiply 1/4 times 364 yards. This results in `0.25*364` equaling 91 yards.\nSimilarly, Grandma used 1/2 of a skein so multiplying 1/2 times 364 yields '0.5*364', resulting in 182 yards.\n\n**Step 2: Sum Up Their Yards Together**\nNow add together all three values calculated above \u2013 original length plus what Mariah used minus already existing material plus what grandma contributed subtracting any overlaps if present here no overlap indicated.
