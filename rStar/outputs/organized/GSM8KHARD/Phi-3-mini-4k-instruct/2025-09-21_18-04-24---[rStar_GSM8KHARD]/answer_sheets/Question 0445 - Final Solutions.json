This growth can also vary depending upon specific conditions like soil quality, light exposure, watering schedule etc., but let\u2019s assume this as our base condition here. By default such plants exhibit rapid vertical expansion during their initial stages due to vigorous vegetative activity driven primarily through cell division within meristematic regions located near root tips \u2013 termed apical dominance mechanism hence allowing them to attain impressive statures over time if cultivated under favorable circumstances. However even before reaching full maturity these juvenile forms require careful nurturing involving adequate spacing apart along with regular pruning techniques aimed towards encouraging lateral branch development thus ensuring balanced structural integrity thereby mitigating potential risks associated wth stem breakage owing excessively heavy fruit loads coupled together simultaneous efforts directed toward optimizing overall yield prospects via strategic selection/rotation practices incorporating various crop species based largely upon local climate patterns amongst other parameters including pest resistance profiles alongside market demand dynamics influencing profitability outcomes relative stakeholder", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard.
