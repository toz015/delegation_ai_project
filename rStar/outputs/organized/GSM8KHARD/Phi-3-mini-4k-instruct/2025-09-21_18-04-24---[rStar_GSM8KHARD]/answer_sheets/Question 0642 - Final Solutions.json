Firstly, we know that Iris spent $8108745 on styling her hair. Secondly, when calculating the cost of doing a manicure, since this service amounts to one fourth (or half divided again) of the hair styling price, we find its value by dividing the initial figure ($8108745) by four or multiplying by 0.25 resulting in approximately $2027186 being spent on manicuring services. Thirdly, considering a pedicure service charges thrice the amount dedicated towards performing a manicure service \u2013 hence tripled $2027186 yields roughly around $6081558 going towards said procedure. Summing these individual totals together results us obtaining the overall summed quantity utilized throughout this particular instance i.e., combining the above mentioned values like so : $8108745(hairstyling)+ $2027186(manicurist)+ $6081558(pedicurer)=~$16217489 altogether", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "At a spa, Iris spent $8108745 to do her hair, 1/4 as much to do a manicure, and 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure.
