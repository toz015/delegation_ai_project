Condition 3: For doing a pedicure, this same person then again charged half or two thirds ((6*2)/(9)) times whatever fee they previously paid upon receiving a manicure service. Question: Based on these costs, calculate the overall sum used towards services rendered within such a beauty salon setting. Please note that you must only consider direct monetary values not tied up indirectly through investment channels like stock market gains etc., while computing totals. Also exclude any potential refund receivables due yet unclaimed. Your response needs precise numerical calculations based solely on explicit stated figures provided during problem setup without assumptions about future financial scenarios.
