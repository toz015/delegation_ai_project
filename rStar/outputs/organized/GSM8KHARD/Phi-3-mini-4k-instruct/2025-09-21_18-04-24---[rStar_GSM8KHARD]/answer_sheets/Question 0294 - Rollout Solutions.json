Subtracting this resultant value from initial amount, i.e., Initial_amount-(Bill'+Mark') =  8963908 -(5228946), leaves us with remaining slice count as 3734962 .

Therefore, these seven twelfth parts of the pizza go to them collectively. We multiply the overall pie count by this fraction to obtain our result: (7/12)*8963908 = approximately 5293227 slices for both Brian and Mark collectedly. However, since you asked about individual allocation too, considering only sharing proportions within available resources rather than totals means halving those amounts. Thus, each gets roughly half i.e., around ~2646614 slices when rounded off downwards due to indivisibility constraints among real world food items like pizzas here discussed!
