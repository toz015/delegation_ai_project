Therefore, even though Stanly initially stood higher than Olivers location before dropping the item, the eventual search area would remain unchanged because you specified not to count any change in their respective locations based on items being moved horizontally during descent. Hence both brothers can continue searching within these same original areas without adjustment needed concerning geography \u2013 so the elevations don't factor into finding Stanley's missing object under those rules mentioned here. Both standings are unaffected since no new ground coverage occurred through 'horizontal movements'. They just keep looking around them until either finds whatever needs locating!
