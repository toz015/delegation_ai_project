Each individual banana costs $0.80, so ten bananas would cost $0.80 multiplied by 10 equals $8. Since one bunch consists of about 8 million (approximated as rounding off) bananas, its equivalent worth when calculated per item basis becomes around ($3 divided by approximately 8 million), which equates roughly to less than half a cent per fruit. Therefore it can be rounded up safely without affecting accuracy significantly; hence we consider this value equal to exactly zero cents i.e., nothing ($0). Given these prices, the savings amount by purchasing in bulk rather than single items amounts to simply taking away no expenditure due to unit pricing from estimated separate purchase totals ($8 subtracted by virtually nothing\u2014zero), resulting again in saving precisely eight dollars since every penny saved still counts towards overall monetary benefits irrespective of negligible differences under estimation assumptions used herein.
