To find the total cost of items purchased during a sale, we first need to calculate the original total cost before any discounts apply. We can determine this value by multiplying the quantity of goods by their individual prices. Once we know the initial amount without considering the sales or markdown percentage, applying the specified percent reduction simplifies our calculation process as it reduces only one fractional portion (discount) rather than involving multiple additive/subtractive operations based upon different values representing quantities of distinct categories such as size, color etc., which would increase computational complexity significantly when attempting large transactions especially ones like these dealing millions in dollar amounts!
