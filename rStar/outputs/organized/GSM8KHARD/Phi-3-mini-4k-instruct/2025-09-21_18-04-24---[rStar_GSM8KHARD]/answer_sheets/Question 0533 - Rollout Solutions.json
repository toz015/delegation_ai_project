Each set of math and science books together weigh 2*2=4 pounds (since both are 2 pounds).

Since this equals the other texts plus another type called History which itself totals doubled its equivalent compared to English i.e., half again than Science or Math meaning if I assume that english equates to S+M because those equations say nothing about any difference among them only that summed up was thrice lesser than H therefore E=(H/2) . Thus translating into algebra :E+(S)=(H/2), replacing my assumed values yields 3+(S)=(H/2); also knowing though that M & S hold identical amount; hence ,S=F=H/4 .
