Here goes this approach without any assumptions other than possible reductions based purely on quantity purchased rather than item type, keeping things basic since details aren't available:\n\nFirstly, find out the cost before taxes using initial conditions ($2 per squirt gun and $892187 per waterballoon):\nCost_per_squirtgun= $2*5=$10 ; Cost_per_waterbagallot= $892187*892187$\u2248 $8.00\u00d710^14 approx\nTotal_cost=(Cost_Per_squirtgunn+Cost_of_WaterBagAllots)=(($10+$8.00\u00d710^14)$\u2248$8.00\u00d710^14 .
