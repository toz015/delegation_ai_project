problem, let\u2019s first convert everything mentioned about charging rates and percentages to uniform units (minutes and charges). Since your current battery level is 60%, you want to know how long it will take to get to 100%. That means you still need another 40% charge. According to the question, every minute increases the charge by .03*(.03)=.0009 or just over four thousandths (.001) of a full charge since ten times hundredth equals whole. Therefore, divide forty (the remaining necessary amount of %charge needed ) by .001(full charger/sec), getting twenty thousand seconds required for full charge completion! However, because our desired measure here asks us \u2018How Long It Will Take To Fully Charge\u2026',we must express those twenty thousands as hour value instead; thus dividing them equally amongst sixty secs yields roughly thirtythree point seven eight hours precisely but round up slightly due to partial minuets not being possible when timing tasks like these using clock faces alone henceforth estimated duration becomes approximately **~33** years...
