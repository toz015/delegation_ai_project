Firstly we know the first investment or expense Carlos makes is to buy/plant the tree; thus, it takes away $90 initially leaving him with no profit yet because all monetary resources go towards purchasing the seedling itself ($0).

His potential revenue per year would be 2256855 multiplied by $1.5 equals $3385282.5 annually. However, the cost of maintaining this amount including watering and feeds adds up as well; specifically, since these expenses remain constant throughout all growing seasons, multiply $3 by one time only because its just needed once regardless of production size ($3). This results into $3 subtracted off our previous result yielding us $(3385282.5-3)=$3385282$. Subtracting out first investment makes $$(3385282-$90)$$, leaving him profitable immediately!

In between classes, work, chores, and sports practice, he managed to respond to just over half of all incoming messages. Today, Jack had 12 missed calls since waking up based on his phone records. He found out later that he didn\u2019t notice any new text messages but answered another fraction of texts compared to yesterday because he wanted to finish replying earlier. Assuming no forgotten emails arrived either day, determine the ratio of unread message notifications to read ones sent late comparing today to yesterday. First, clarify your understanding of ratios regarding comparisons across different timescales such as days. Ratios compare quantities measured against their respective units without considering timing differences unless explicitly stated otherwise. Can you provide specific data relating notices like call counts to individual notification types for both days?
