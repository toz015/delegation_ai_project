With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 5294275 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": 10590600.0, "gold_answer": "10590600.0"}
