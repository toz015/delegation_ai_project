Given that the Sale Price is $7166896 and the Discount Rate is 25%, or 0.25 when expressed as a decimal, you can rearrange the equation to solve for the Original Price like so: Original Price = Sale Price / (1 - Discount Rate). Plugging in your numbers gets us: Original Price = $7166896 / (1 - 0.25) = $10222528.
