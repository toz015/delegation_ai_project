This represents both writing and recording times combined since these activities took place sequentially during this period rather than simultaneously like editing which could overlap other tasks but still takes up part of the timeline nonetheless. Hence, Editing alone accounts for only about one third i.e., roughly around  30%. To calculate precisely we divide the time taken specifically while doing edits over all collective actions undertaken leading upto present moment & express such fractional value through multiplication using hundred percent symbol yielding its numerical counterpart hence round off resulting figure gets obtained ultimately getting us closer towards desired resolution; resultantly arrives at being equated approximately near equivalent figures close enough approximating actual scenario closely aligning well within margin errors causing negligible deviation affecting outcome greatly undermining exactitude thereby necessitating subsequent application omit any further computational steps following suit accordingly based above provided calculation methodology ensuring optimal accuracy throughout entire procedure without compromising precision whatsoever!
