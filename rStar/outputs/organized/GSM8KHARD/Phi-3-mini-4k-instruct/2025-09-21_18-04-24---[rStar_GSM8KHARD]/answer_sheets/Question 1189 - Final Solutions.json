To optimize your profit while considering market volatility when employing options trading strategies like straddles (buying both call and put options) or strangles (buying out-of-the-money calls and puts), you need to assess several factors including expiration dates, strike prices relative to expected price movements, implied volatility levels, risk tolerance, and capital allocation.
