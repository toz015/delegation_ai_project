It says 3 less than six potatoes makes up 1 less than 3 scoops; this means if we consider 'x', the equation becomes ((6-3)/(3-1))*x=2. Solving this yields x as being equal to four. This indicates you need about four potatoes to prepare just over half a scoop of mashed potatoes. Given such data let us proceed further assuming only whole numbers could count toward our calculation since fractions aren't practical here hence rounding down slightly implies approximately every fourth potato contributes towards making a single portion.
