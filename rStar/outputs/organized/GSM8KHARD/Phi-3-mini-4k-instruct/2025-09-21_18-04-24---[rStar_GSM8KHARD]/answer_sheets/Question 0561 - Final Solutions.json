Here\u2019s how that works mathematically:\n\nFor vanilla scents:  \nDaily usage rate is 5 vanilla scents/package  \nAvailable packages initially = Total stock / Daily Usage Rate   \n                           = (7067085 scents) / (5 scents/pack)  \n                           \u2248 1413417 packets   \nThis means nearly entire supply was utilised throughout working hours leaving none behind. However let us still work through exact subtraction just so our math holds true even accounting complete supplies expended like below:    \nUnaccountable Packages Left Over = Original Amount - Used Up Stock       \n                             = (7067085 scents)-((1413417 )\u2022(5))      \n                             \u2260 Zero ; instead its approx value comes around      = 2", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A perfume company is trying to create new scents.
