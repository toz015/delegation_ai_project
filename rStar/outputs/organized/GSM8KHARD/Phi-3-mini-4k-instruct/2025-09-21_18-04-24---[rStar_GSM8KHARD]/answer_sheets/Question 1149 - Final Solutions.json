We know that normally one scoop of ice cream costs $1.50 ($condition 2). But if Erin buys two scoops together, she gets one additional scoop for free ($condition 1$). This means that technically speaking, for every $3 spent, she actually receives four scoops ($*2$/$*$3$, which simplifies to **multiplication**) because those savings allow her to get double the usual amounts without spending anything extra!
