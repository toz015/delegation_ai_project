Answer = ?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Firstly, let\u2019s find out how many portions of Muffaletta Sandwich will be required to serve all the guests assuming every guest receives only ONE part of their share. Since every single person gets exactly 1 lb., therefore Total Pounds Required= Number Of Guests Which equals To :  5979089 lbs.

This implies determining the overall requirements necessary to fulfill all visitors needs considering 'one portion'.
