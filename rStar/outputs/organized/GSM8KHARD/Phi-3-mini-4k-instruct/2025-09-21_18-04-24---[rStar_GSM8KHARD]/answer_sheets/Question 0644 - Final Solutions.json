steps using provided hints as guidance rather than directly correlating them to our situation which seems different because it\u2019s focused mainly around other purchases not related to the details mentioned about Kellogg owning several packages of Chicken or Strawberry packs etc., nor any mention of Apple Product Set Sales Price being relevant until later stages. However, I will walk you through general approach if applicable elsewhere. Remember though your query focus isn't explicitly addressed yet concerning Kelsey specifically who didn't buy anything aside from Apples! Let me try to help anyway...\n\nHere goes attempt to clarify things.. As hint suggests 'Calculating Retail Basket Contents Weight', implies perhaps dealing primarily with certain types(items like Fruits maybe?) ,but no explicit reference found otherwise except last statement talking Absolute Difference Between Total Budget Left And Spending Which Sounds Very Important But Seems Mention Against Only Final Summation Of All Purchased Items Cost NOT Individual Item Prices OR Even Their Quantities Per Se Hence Direct Application Owing To Lack Clear Understanding Over Whose Shopping List Was Exactly Being Discussed Here About", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
