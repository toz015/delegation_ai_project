Given these details, let's focus purely on counting buildings constructed rather than dwelling durations because your query specifies interest in the count excluding times spent living in them. However, since the duration lived doesn't necessarily correlate to constructions made independently nor sequentially tied to the overall timeline presented, except perhaps suggesting periodic returns to site activities (either maintenance or additional structures), my interpretation could lead to confusion.
