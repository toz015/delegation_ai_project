Initially we know Mike consumes three packs or approximately thirty six eggs(since generally there aren't half eggs). This would mean about fourteen eggs being used up initially.

To make things easier we round off these values so here initial value becomes eighteen while post increment rounds off to fifteen therefore making overall weekdays come down to roughly eleven teens if
