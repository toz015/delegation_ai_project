Tom buys 2 plane tickets which costs him 5000x2=$10,000.

However, as mentioned above prices go up due to peak season hence additional fees accrued upon booking these rooms add another sum equals to 4500x(20/100) equal to 4500x0.2=$900. Adding both amounts together provides us the exact figure spent on accommodation thus yields us $(4500+900)$=$(5400).

Firstly, we calculate the increased cost of staying at the hotel due to demand during their visit. Normally, the hotel charges $1500 per night but since it\u2019s booked during a busy period, this increases by 20%. To find out what this increase amounts to, multiply $1500 by 20%, i.e., $1500*(20/100) which equals $300. Adding up these extra fees results into new daily rate of ($1500+$300)=$1800 as opposed to original charge being just $1500. Since Tom and his spouse stayed in the same hotel for three (3) consecutive days, the total amount spent would thus become equal to [($1800)*(days)]=[$1800]*[3]= $5400.

Next up would be calculating their staying expenses; this includes accommodation as well. Under usual circumstances without any increase during peak season or holidays ($1500), since due to high demand, prices increased by 20%, so new daily rate becomes $1500 plus another 20%($300) totalling $1800/day.
