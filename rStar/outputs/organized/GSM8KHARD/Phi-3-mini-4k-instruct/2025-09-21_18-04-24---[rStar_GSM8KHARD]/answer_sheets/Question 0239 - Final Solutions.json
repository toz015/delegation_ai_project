When ice cubes are introduced into hot coffee, it lowers the overall temperature but also increases the amount of dissolved substances present initially because of evaporation losses before freezing occurs. This can create local fluctuations around equilibrium positions affected by kinetic activity leading to increased mixing and potentially faster homogenization times than expected purely based on thermal contraction alone.

First, it lowers the temperature of the coffee mixture because heat transfer occurs from the warmer substance (coffee) to the colder object (ice), causing the latter to absorb thermal energy until equilibrium is achieved\u2014a principle rooted in basic thermodynamics. Second, once the ice starts melting inside the hot coffee, it adds additional volume without necessarily proportionately increasing the amount of dissolved solutes present initially in the coffee. As a result, even though only pure water comes from the frozen state itself, the subsequent increase in volume can make the solution seem relatively 'weaker,' i.e., reduced in caffeinated potency perceived by consumers who associate higher temperatures with greater strength. Additionally, this infusion of fresh water also means mixing content disturbances occur leading to temporary heterogeneity before reaching homogeneity again following natural diffusion and stirring movements typically employed by baristas prior to serving customers their desired drinks.
