We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels which we calculated as 486527. Therefore, Aaron has 486527 + 5 = 486532 jewels. Finally, since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron; therefore, Siobhan has 486532 - 2 = 486530 jewels. The answer is: 486530.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
