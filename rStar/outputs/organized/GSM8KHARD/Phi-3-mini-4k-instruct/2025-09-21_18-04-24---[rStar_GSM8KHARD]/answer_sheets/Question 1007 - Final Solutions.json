Substituting this value back into our original statement for Gold Coins results in (3532178+30) equalling approximately 3532208 or about 353221 when rounded off at one significant figure due to precision error introduced during calculation steps while dealing with large numbers like 7064386.

Since there are 30 fewer silver coins than gold coins (\\( g \\)), we can say \\( s = g - 30 \\). According to the information provided, together the golden and silver coins amount to 7,064,386. Therefore, the sum of golden and silver coins equates to the following mathematical representation: \\( g + s = 7,064,386 \\). Substituting \\( s \\) with \\( g - 30 \\), this becomes \\( g + (g - 30) = 7,064,386 \\). Simplifying further results in \\( 2g - 30 = 7,064,386 \\). To solve for \\( g \\), use the addition property of equality by adding 30 to both sides resulting in \\( 2g = 7,064,416 \\).
