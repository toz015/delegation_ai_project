To find out this difference, simply calculate 7 minus these known amounts which equal 7 - 3 or precisely four additional hours available. Because each half-hour slot equals .5 when converted into decimal form, multiply the amount needed\u2014four full hours worth (.5*4)*4 results in six individual sixty minute blocks being required to achieve the target duration fully comprised only within twenty minutes intervals. Thus it follows logically, since twelve thirty minute segments equate to six complete hours necessary, twice as often would mean seeing through doubled quantity hence eighty sessions fitting perfectly underneath said parameters while ensuring no leftover fractions remained unassigned nor surpluses accumulated excessively thereby preserving uniformity across daily viewing habits alike whilst simultaneously adhering strictly towards quantifiable specifications set forth initially upon presentation herewithin.
