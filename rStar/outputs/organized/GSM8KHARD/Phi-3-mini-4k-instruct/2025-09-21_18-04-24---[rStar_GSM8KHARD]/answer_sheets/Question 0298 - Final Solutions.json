We know one glass of milk equals to 8 ounces, therefore if John consumed 2 glasses of milk he took in 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 ounces of milk.

Hence, the correct calculation result would indeed amount up to approximately 148 million(not exactly) which indicates mistake or typo error either within provided numbers as no exact figure corresponds with real life scenario considering nutritional facts about human consumption of food items specifically mentioned here i.e., 'milk'.
