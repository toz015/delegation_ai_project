We calculate savings using the formula below;\n\nTotal costs saved during one period \u2013 Total earnings obtained during same timeframe=total_saved  \nSo ,$1750-$3500=-$1750(negative because spending went up due to higher price compared to previous sales revenue.) Thus, it means instead of saving money through increased expenses, he ended up making less than previously so no actual 'money saved', only loss accumulated overtime if purchased continuously without ceasing purchases just for evaluation purposes since question asks about short term changes within few hours not long run effects like annual financial plans etc..
