Finally convert these copses to pints considering 1 pint equates roughly to 2 cups, what\u2019s the resultant number rounded off upwardly when dealing with measurements involving liquid volumes?", "subanswer": {"text": "First converting the content of each container to liters results in 3.77 gallons/container * (1 liter/0.264172 gallons) ~=  14.28 liters/container. Then converting liters to cups yields 14.28 liters/container * (1 cup/0.236588 liters) =~  60.39 cups/container. Since 1 pint corresponds to 2 cups or 0.5 quarts, multiplying our previous value by .5 converts the units appropriately leading us to conclude ~ 30.195 pints/container, rounding upwards becomes 31 pints/container. Hence, Josey needs approx 31 pints of gasoline to operate her mower based upon its capacity relative to individual storage vessels being used herein described. Answer is approximated because exact conversions may vary slightly due to differences between measurement systems worldwide but adherence remains consistent within defined parameters mentioned previously.

To get this figure, divide the total amount (13610160 gallons) by the number of containers (3610160). This calculation would look like this:  13610160 / 3610160 = 3.77 gallons approximately. Therefore, every single container holds about 3.77 gallons when these amounts are evenly distributed across all available storage spaces. However, since it seems unreasonable for a standard gasoline container or car tank capacity being less than four whole numbers of liters due to potential measurement errors during division operation, let\u2019s round up our result as well because fueling station usually fill half liter increments thus providing us better realistic solution which comes down around 4 gallons considering practical application circumstances.
