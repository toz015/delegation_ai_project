We know that James is hanging the crepe-paper directly overlapping every second post because otherwise if not mentioned any other condition about overlap percentage, let us assume complete coverage i.e., no gaping spaces hence only considering alternate posts. Consider 'L' equals to the longest side here which means its halfway points being covered twice while shorter ends covering once due to their placement opposite direction relative to larger dimensions thus leading to fewer necessary lengths overall when running diagonals across smaller width compared large height resulting into minimum coverage requirement without redundant stretchings but rather direct usage of material required thereby reducing waste also factoring in possible irregularities like slackness/tension issues ensuring efficiency too!
