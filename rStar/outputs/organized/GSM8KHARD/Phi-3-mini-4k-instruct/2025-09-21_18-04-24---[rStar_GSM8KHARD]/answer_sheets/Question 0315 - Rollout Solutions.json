We subtract 4 since her sister\u2019s name contains 4 less characters as per the puzzle statement, hence \\( 4029585 - 4 = 4029581 \\) is obtained, representing the size of her sister's entire surname. When combined , we obtain 'Total Letters= 12088751'. Thus, adding 'Indras''' name length (\\(8059170\\)) plus her sister's complete name size (\\(4029581\\)), results in 'Total Letters= 12088751', implying when united these represent all possible unique combinations within their surnames alone without repeating any character sequence.
