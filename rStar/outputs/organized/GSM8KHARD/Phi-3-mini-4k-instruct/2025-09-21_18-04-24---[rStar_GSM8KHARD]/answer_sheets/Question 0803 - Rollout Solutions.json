That would be one whole plus a fourth which equals seven parts divided into four equal sections.\nSo if we take away the three quarters taken by Pierre and Peter altogether, this leaves only one twelfth remaining for Jacques because it was equally split amongst them based upon individual preferences before making the decision as such using proportional distribution methods like mentioned above herein described earlier provided so you may clearly see my logic behind working through these calculations along side me once I provide further details regarding mathematical formulas used whilst doing simple division etc...

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques initially bought 12 kg of apples. Peter took a quarter which means peter takes (1/4)x(12)kg=3kg. And paul took one third i.e., Paula gets (1/3)(12)=4kg out of it.
