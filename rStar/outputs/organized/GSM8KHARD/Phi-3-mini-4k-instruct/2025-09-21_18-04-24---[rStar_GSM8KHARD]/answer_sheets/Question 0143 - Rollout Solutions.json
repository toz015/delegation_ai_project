Can you turn the above English content into an Arabic version please? I understand that translations can sometimes vary depending on context, but here\u2019s my best attempt based solely on your original instructions without considering regional nuances or idiomatic expressions. This translation uses common words and straightforward descriptions suitable for clear communication across languages while adhering closely to the technical details provided in the documents. It assumes no prior knowledge about specific entities mentioned (such as 'Purdue',) ensuring accessibility even when certain references might not directly match familiar localized terminology. Moreover, despite potential differences in document management systems like CASRAI standards versus LMS metadata schema conventions such as META IPF+RDF described within ISO/IEC TR 25012 parts 1 & 2 sections regarding entity definitions, these aspects remain unaddressed due to lack of detail related specifically to those frameworks; thus focusing exclusively on universal principles applicable wherever necessary during data integration processes involving scholarly publications.'", "3": "Answer: \"\u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0629: \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064b\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0638\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u0637\u0644\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0641\u0625\u0646 \u0623\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u062d\u0648\u0627\u0644\u064a 90 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u0629 \u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0633\u0628\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0644\u0640 40 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641.", "4": "Answer: \"\u0627\u0644\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0647\u064a: 12500\"."}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
