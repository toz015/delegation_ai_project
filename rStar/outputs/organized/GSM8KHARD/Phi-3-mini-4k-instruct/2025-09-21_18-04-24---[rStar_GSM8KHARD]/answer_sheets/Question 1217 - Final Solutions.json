Eight video games at $20 each would be 8 * $20 = $160 worth altogether.

Let V represent the price paid for the 8 video games combined which totals up to $((8*video_game_price)*videogames)+($chicken_dinner)=V$. We need to solve it following equation $$((8\\cdot video\\_game\\_price)\\cdot videogames)+$change=V$$ But I realized something was missing! It seems like information about other factors affecting their finances such as costs associated with buying/maintaining the gaming consoles haven't been mentioned explicitly nor estimated numerically due to lack of contextual details hence making direct calculation impossible unless otherwise informed i.e., time used playing X hours & annual percentage rate Y%. Nevertheless, keeping aside complications relating to potential additional income sources not covered herein including possible dividends etc.. let me simplify things further still taking into account only relevant info available thus far... Consider S represents sale proceedings stemming solely through disposed items minus residuals whilst T denotes Total collected amassment resulting exclusively post property exchange activities exclusive of incidental changes carried forward subsequently along side explicit reference points presented earlier namely Video Games Cost=$160+$Change", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
