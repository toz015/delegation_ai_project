According to the problem statement, |B| equals the sum of male players in both tennis and volleyball plus female players in soccer minus everyone else involved in these activities. However, since no specific numbers regarding males versus females within football aren't provided\u2014and considering 'twice' relates directly to tennis player count without segregation based upon gender from previous questions\u2014the calculation cannot be performed accurately using solely information about boyvolleyball ratio; hence an assumption would lead towards ambiguity making such detailed deduction mathematically unsound with available data alone.
