Henceforth considering only full span duration without factoring partial transition phases \u2013 let us denote n representing countable entity denoting complete sets comprising both ordinary plus augmentation quantities cumulatively computed thusly :  \nn*x+y=z ; Herewith 'n' symbolizes respective quantity units constituting identical constituent groupings being evaluated collectively while simultaneously appraised independently hence rendering them effectively parallel entities under scrutiny irrespective if considered separately", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
