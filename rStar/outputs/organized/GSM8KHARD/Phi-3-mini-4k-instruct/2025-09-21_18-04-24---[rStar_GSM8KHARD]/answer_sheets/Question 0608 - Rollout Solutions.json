Hence, if 'R' represents the quantity created by Rory, this translates mathematically as follows:\nGiven clue says, so let's denote Rory's production as \u2018R\u2019 which equals to: R = 3,052,884 (Kora) + 3,052,884\nUpon simplification, we get R=6,105,768 dishes.\nSecond part states Jada produces double what Rory would produce.
