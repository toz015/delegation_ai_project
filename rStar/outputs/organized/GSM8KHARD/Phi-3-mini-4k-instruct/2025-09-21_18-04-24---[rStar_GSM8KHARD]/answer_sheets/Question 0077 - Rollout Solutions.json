We know our question asks about all the teachers combined; since these actions don\u2019t depend upon or affect others, multiplying those individual values yields our solution. Hence every teacher makes their own set contribution without interacting \u2013 like independent parts working together toward completion of whole system objectives while remaining self contained within personal cycles/rounds. Therefore: Teachers_total*(Lessons_per_Teacher*Cleanings_per_Session)=Total Cleanings Needed Every Day Thus=Nine Million Six Hundred Forty Two Thousand Seven Multiplied By One Times Three Equals Twenty-Seven Point Four Eight Nine To Summarize All Together , Total Class Board Cleans Daily Amount equals Seventy Seven Billion Sixty Eight Hundred Ninety Zero Units .
