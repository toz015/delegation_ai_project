From the problem, we know that the fourth individual received twice the amount divided equally split between Amora and Lainey plus 15 additional chips. Therefore, if \\(A\\) represents the amount Amora/Lainey receive individually without the extra 15 chips, the calculation would look like this: \\((2 \\times A) + 15\\). However, when distributing even amounts here (\\(\\frac{A}{2}\\) per individual receiving same shares because \\(\\frac{Total\\ Number\\ Of\\ Chips - Additional\\ Fifteen}{(Number\\ Of\\ People\\ Excluding\\ One)}\\)), we actually establish that \\((2 \\times A) / 2 = A\\).

Let\u2019s say Y represents the initial share without any bonuses; hence X=Y since their shares are stated to be equal under normal circumstances. Since these people also include someone else receiving even greater amounts including an additional 15 chips on top, let Z represent the final count for all others combined beyond Amora and Lainey \u2013 meaning, Z equals Y+Z_bonus where Z_bonus stands for zillions or whatever the unknown sum might add up too making Z larger than either X nor Y alone.
