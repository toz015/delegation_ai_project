First, let's find out the total number of problems on all the worksheets. Since each worksheet has 4 problems, multiplying this by the total number of worksheets (16) gives us the overall problem count. That would be 4 * 16 = 64 problems. Next, knowing that the teacher has already graded 8 of these worksheets, we multiply the number of graded worksheets (8) by the number of problems per worksheet (4) to calculate how many problems have been graded so far. This results in 8 * 4 = 32 problems graded. To figure out how many problems still need grading, subtract the number of problems graded (32) from the total number of problems (64).
