At the start of the year, there were 31 students. 5 students left and 11 new students joined. To find out how many students left, we can see how much the student count changed before considering who was still present. The net change due to new students joining was an increase of \\(11\\) (new students) \\(-5\\) (students who left) \\(= 6\\). Since this net increase resulted in having \\(31 - 5 + 11 = 37\\) students instead of the initial \\(31\\), the original calculation of adding new students to figure out the number of students who left (\\(37 - 31 = 6\\)) is incorrect based on the problem statement. \n\nGiven correctly that:\n\n- Initially there were 31 students.\n- 5 students left.\n- 11 new students joined.\n\nThe correct way to find out how many students were left over without considering the addition or subtraction leading to the 37 total at one point would be to look directly at what happened: since the question asks how many students left (and not how many remain), it essentially wants us to recognize the direct decrease from the initial amount when accounting", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
