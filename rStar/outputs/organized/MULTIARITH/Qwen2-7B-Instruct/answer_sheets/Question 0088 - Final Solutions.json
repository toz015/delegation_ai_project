Let me walk through this again correctly:\n\nHere's the clarification on the hint: Given that Nancy has arranged her bookcase with each shelf holding exactly 6 books.\n\nFor the mystery shelves:\n- We know there are 2 shelves dedicated solely to mystery books.\n\nFor the picture book shelves:\n- There are 6 shelves dedicated to picture books.\n\nSince each shelf, regardless of what type of book(s) they contain, holds exactly 6 books, we calculate the total number of books by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:\n\nTotal Mystery Books = Number of Mystery Shelves \u00d7 Number of Books per Shelf\nTotal Picture Books = Number of Picture Book Shelves \u00d7 Number of Books per Shelf\n\nGiven that:\nTotal Mystery Books = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\nTotal Picture Books = 6 \u00d7 6 = 36\n\nTherefore, the total number of books Nancy has is the sum of these totals:\nTotal Books = Total Mystery Books + Total Picture Books\nTotal Books = 12 + 36 = 48\n\nThe answer is: Nancy has 48 books in total across both the mystery and picture book shelves.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": " Nancy was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 6 books on it.
