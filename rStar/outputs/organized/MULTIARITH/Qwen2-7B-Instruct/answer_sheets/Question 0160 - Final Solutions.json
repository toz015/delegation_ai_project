If he sold 39 games, that leaves him with 57 - 39 = 18 games. Since he packs these remaining games into boxes of 2 games each, we divide the remaining amount by 2 to find the number of boxes: 18 / 2 = 9 boxes. \n\nThis means, after selling some of his games, Luke has 9 boxes worth of games left.\n\nThe answer is: 9 boxes or equivalently, 18 games if you count each box as containing exactly 2 games.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many boxes did he have to use?", "subanswer": {"text": "With 18 games left (after selling), packing them into boxes where 2 fit each, Luke would need 9 boxes.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
