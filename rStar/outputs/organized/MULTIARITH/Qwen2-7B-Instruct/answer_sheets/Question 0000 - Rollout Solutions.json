However, if we're considering the scenario where Paige had 11 songs initially and ended up with fewer because she deleted some, but no final count of remaining songs provided:\n\nGiven this setup alone, the actual number of songs Paige deleted would depend on her final count of songs. Without that figure, it's not possible to determine the exact number of songs deleted. \n\nFor instance, if she ended up with 1 song left, she'd have deleted \\(11 - 1 = 10\\) songs.\nConversely, if she ended up with 5 songs, she'd have deleted \\(11 - 5 = 6\\) songs.\n\nIn summary, Paige could have deleted anywhere from 1 to 10 songs depending on her final count, but since your query doesn't specify this final count, I can only state:\n\nPaige deleted a certain unknown number of songs which falls within the range of 1 to 10, inclusive.\n\nTo give you a precise numerical answer, you need to provide the final count of songs Paige had after deleting some.
