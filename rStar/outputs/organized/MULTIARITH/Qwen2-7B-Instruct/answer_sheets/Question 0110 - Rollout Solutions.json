Let me explain how one might approach such a calculation:\n\nTo find out how many pages John uses, first add together the numbers of 'new' and 'old' cards:\n\nNumber of total cards = Number of new cards + Number of old cards\n\nAfter finding the total, divide that sum by the number of cards per page (in this case, 3):\n\nNumber of pages used = Total number of cards / Number of cards per page\n\nFor example, if John had 8 new cards and 16 old cards:\n\nTotal number of cards = 8 + 16 = 24\n\nThen, since each page holds 3 cards,\n\nNumber of pages used = 24 / 3 = 8\n\nSo, John would use 8 pages for his collection if he managed to distribute them evenly across those pages.
