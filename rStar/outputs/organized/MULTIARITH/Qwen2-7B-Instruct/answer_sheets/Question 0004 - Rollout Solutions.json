If you have points but no remaining enemies, it implies all the enemies were defeated. Hence if 11 enemies were present initially and none are left, all were defeated. Since every defeat results in gaining 9 points, defeating 11 enemies would have resulted in 11*9 = 99 points assuming each enemy was worth 9 points to defeat. However, without knowing your current score or how many points you actually have, we can only determine the maximum possible points which comes from defeating all enemies, i.e., 99 points. The question, however, doesn't provide enough information to accurately calculate any other value such as 'remaining intact' enemies unless these points represent a direct translation into how many enemies remain, which isn't specified here. Without this context, or additional data (like the current score), we cannot definitively say how many enemies remain untouched. \n\nIt seems like there might be a misunderstanding or lack of sufficient details in the provided scenario because based on common video game scoring mechanics, once all enemies are defeated, there wouldn't be any remaining.
