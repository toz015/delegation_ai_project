We can calculate the total number of parakeets first before moving onto the parrots. Each cage has 2 parakeets so for 4 cages: 4 cages times 2 parakeets per cage equals 8 parakeets total.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of parrots following the hint. Since each cage has 8 parrots and there are 4 cages, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total parrots} = \\text{Number of cages} \\times \\text{Parrots per cage} = 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\parrots\\]\n\nTo find the total number of birds in the pet store, we'll add together the total number of parrots and the total number of parakeets:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total birds} = \\text{Total parrots} + \\text{Total parakeets} = 32 + 8 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pet store has 40 birds in total.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": " A pet store has 4 bird cages.
