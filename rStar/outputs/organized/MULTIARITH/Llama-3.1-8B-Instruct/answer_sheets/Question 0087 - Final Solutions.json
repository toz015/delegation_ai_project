To find this, we first need to determine the total number of bags that Kaleb collected.  He filled 5 bags on Saturday and another 5 bags on Sunday, which makes a total of 10 bags. Next, we need to figure out the number of cans per bag. It is mentioned that each bag has 4 cans in it. Finally, to calculate the total number of cans collected, we can multiply the total number of bags (which we found earlier) by the number of cans per bag (which is 4).
