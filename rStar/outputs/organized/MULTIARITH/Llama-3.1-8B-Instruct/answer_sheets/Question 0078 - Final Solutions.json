So now she has 37 + 15 = 52. The answer is: 52.  Alternatively, we could calculate this as (48 - 11) + 15. We can use the order of operations (PEMDAS), which states that we calculate what's inside the parentheses first. So, 48 - 11 is 37. Then 37 + 15 is 52. Another way to look at it is to notice that 48 - 11 is the same thing as 37. And 37 + 15 is the same thing as 52. Since these two expressions evaluate to the same value (52), we can replace either one with its equivalent expression to get (37) + 15 or 48 - 11 + 15. It doesn't matter which method we use, we still get the same result. This is just another example of how different mathematical representations can lead us to the same solution.
