We also know that after eating some and getting 40 more, she ended up having 7. (This was not directly mentioned but can be inferred as we'll see below). First, let's figure out how many pieces she had after eating some. We don't know exactly how many she ended up with after just eating some, so let's call that X. After getting 40 more pieces, she had 7, so X + 40 = 7. To solve this equation, we need to isolate X. That means subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, so X = 7 - 40 = -33. But this makes no sense, because you cannot have a negative amount of candy. However, when looking back at the instructions, it seems to indicate that 7 was the result of the second part of the question (\"she ended up having 7\"). Since we know that the number of pieces she had before eating any should be 47 - 25 = 22, it suggests that what happened next (her sister giving her more) doesn't affect our calculation for the first night, which we already solved above.
