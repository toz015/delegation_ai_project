Then write an equation to represent the situation. We know that dividing the number (x) by 3 equals 7. The equation will be x/3 = 7. To solve the problem, multiply both sides of the equation by 3. This cancels out division by 3 on the left side of the equation. Then simplify both sides of the equation. Answer the question at the end.

Also, use only one hint if possible. The hints were written before I learned about this format so I just put them in here. They're not needed. I made sure to take them out of my responses. Just ignore them. The answers can't contain any words, like \"days\" or \"candies\". Only numbers. It would make sense to add a line to explain what your function can solve (like 'simple algebraic equations' or something). Let me know if you want anything changed! I tried my best to help.
