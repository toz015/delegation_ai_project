To find the total amount of scarves, we need to multiply 4 (number of scarves per box) by 8 (the total number of boxes). This equals 32 scarves.\n Inside each box, there were also 6 mittens. To find the total amount of mittens, we need to multiply 6 (number of mittens per box) by 8 (total number of boxes). This equals 48 mittens.\nTherefore, Zoe has a total of 32 scarves + 48 mittens = 80 pieces of winter clothing! We didn't just count only one type of winter clothing. Therefore,  Zoe has 80 pieces of winter clothing in total.\n\nHowever, this problem was not following the exact instruction given since it did not contain one clear question, so I'll provide the requested answer as the sum of the hints which both stated their answer.
