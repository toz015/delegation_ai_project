To solve this problem we need to know the total number of players which is 8. We also need to know that we want to divide them up into groups of 4. Since each player can only belong to one group, we can't just keep making groups until all the players are assigned to a group as you would if you were simply dividing 8 by 4. Instead, you need to figure out how many different ways you can make 4-player groups using all the available players. The formula for this is known as combination: C(n,k)=n!/(k!(n-k)!). Where n is the total number of items and k is the size of each item. Here, n=8, since there are 8 players and k=4, since we're forming groups of 4 players. Plugging our values into the formula we get: C(8,4)=(8!)/(4!(8-4)!)=(8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1)=70. Therefore, there are 70 distinct groups that can be formed using the total number of players on the team.
