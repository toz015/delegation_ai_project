According to condition 2, he sells 39 of them. So he has 57 - 39 = 18 games left. According to condition 3, he puts 2 games into each box. To find out how many boxes he can fill, we need to divide the remaining games by 2 (the number of games per box). 18 / 2 is 9. The answer is: 9.  Hint 2: Let's try another way to solve this problem. Since Luke has 18 games left and he puts 2 games in each box, let's ask ourselves, what if he filled all his boxes. How many games would he put away? He could put 2 games in each of 18/2 boxes. That means he would put 2 x 9= 18 games away. But he only has 18 games left! Therefore he must be able to fit exactly 9 boxes. This makes sense because we know he can't put any more than 9 because he wouldn't have enough games. And he definitely can put less than 9 or else it would say so.
