Since each group needs to have 6 players, we need to divide 54 by 6. That is 54 \u00f7 6 = 9. The answer is: 9. \nBut since you said I was not correct, let me explain again: When dividing, if there's no remainder, it means that the division went perfectly and every single item was put into its corresponding group. If there is a remainder, it means that one or several items couldn't find a group (they're \"left over\"). The problem tells us that there are 54 players and that we can put them into groups of 6. Let's try it: If we put 6 players into each group, we get a total of 54 \u00f7 6 = 9 groups without any leftover. Hence, the problem implies that all 54 players can indeed fit into groups of 6. Therefore, there are exactly 9 groups of 6 players each, because we divided the total number of players by the number of players per group (that is 54 \u00f7 6) and didn't have to worry about any leftover.
