In other words it wants us to know the number of 4 person tables (not including the 8 that already stayed), which was found earlier as 2 tables of four. Hence the answer to how many tables existed in addition to the eight would be 2 tables. However, this isn't what we're looking for.

But let\u2019s divide and see what happens when we round off instead. If the waiter had some other customers, let\u2019s assume he had x of these 4 people groups, that will mean 4x people, and he also had 22 \u2013 4x other customers. Since all the people came back, 4x + (22 \u2013 4x) = 22. By cancelling out 4x from both sides of the equation, we get 22. That makes sense because if no one left, everyone stayed! So the real trick here is finding the value of 4x which represents the number of tables the waiter had. As mentioned earlier, 4x + 22 \u2013 4x = 22. Now we know that 22 \u2013 4x = 0 since we want 22 \u2013 4x to equal zero. Then 22 = 4x, which means 4x = 22, x = 22/4 = 5.5. Because you can\u2019t have half a table in the restaurant, you must have 5 full tables or more. Since we already know that x = 5.5, we round up to make sure that our answer will be correct. We add 1 to 5.5 which becomes 6.5. But remember, you cannot have half a table! However, if you go above the 6.5 mark, say, 7.0, then you\u2019re adding too many tables and this means that the number of tables should be rounded down not up. So in order to solve this problem, we need to find the nearest whole number to 5.5, in order to get the minimum number of full tables needed. 5.5 rounded up is 6 and 5.5 rounded down is 5 but if there were actually 5 full tables and 2 people who didn\u2019t sit down with any group of 4 people, we could conclude that there weren\u2019t enough people sitting down with their respective groups, because there weren\u2019t enough chairs at those tables to accommodate them so therefore the only possible solution to this puzzle is that there are indeed 5 full tables plus an extra 2 person table which is equivalent to another table, therefore making the", "value": 0.3125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": " A waiter had 22 customers in his section.
