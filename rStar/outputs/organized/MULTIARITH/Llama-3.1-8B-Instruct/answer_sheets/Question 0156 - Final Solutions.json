We know he filled 3 bags on Saturday. Next, we need to figure out how many cans Sam picked up on Sunday. We know he filled 4 bags on Sunday. Since each bag contains 9 cans, let's start with finding the total number of cans picked up on both Saturday and Sunday combined. To find this total, first add the number of bags from Saturday and Sunday together. 3 + 4 is 7. So in total, Sam had 7 bags.
