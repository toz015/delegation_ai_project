The answer is 2.  Step 5: The answer is 2. ### Instruction: There are 18 pencils in a pencil box. If we take away 9 pencils, what fraction of the original number of pencils remains in the box? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine how many pencils are removed from the box. We know that we remove 9 pencils. Step 2: Calculate how many pencils remain in the box. We started with 18 pencils, so we subtract 9 pencils to get 18 - 9 = 9 pencils remaining. Step 3: To determine the fraction that remains in the box, divide the number of pencils remaining by the original number of pencils. Fraction = Number of remaining pencils / Total number of pencils Fraction = 9/18 = 0.5 or 50% Step 4: Simplify the fraction if it can be reduced further. In this case, the fraction cannot be simplified. However, it's often easier to express fractions as decimals or percentages when the question asks for a percentage, like here.
