We can break down the solution into steps. Step 1: Determine the current number of students before adding any new students or subtracting any existing ones. The original number of students was 31. Five students left, leaving us with 31 - 5 = 26 students. However, this doesn't directly answer the question; we're trying to find out how many students are in the class after considering both the departures and additions. Step 2: Include the 11 new students who joined the class. This would mean the total becomes 26 (students remaining) + 11 (new students) = 37 students. This confirms our understanding, but we want to know how many students remained after all changes happened. Since we initially had 31 students, the net change is a loss of students, specifically 6 fewer students than the 37 we calculated. We arrived at this calculation through subtraction based on the initial clue about matching the starting point. This indicates an error in reasoning, since simply applying addition and subtraction would normally provide the correct count, regardless of the initial number.
