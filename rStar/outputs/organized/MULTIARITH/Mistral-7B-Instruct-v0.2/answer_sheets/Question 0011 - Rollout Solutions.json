We know the initial amounts Debby and her sister had, and we also know that they consumed 35 pieces of candy together. Since Debby's portion was 32, and her sister had 42, it must have been Debby who gave away some of her candies to her sister, as her share was less than hers. Thus, Debby gave away 42 - 32 = 10 pieces of candy. And so the total amount consumed is 32 (Debby's) + 10 (given by Debby) + 42 (her sister's) = 84. However, the problem asks for the consumption on the first night only, which was 35. Therefore, the mistake lies in the text stating that the two sisters consumed all their candies together. Instead, they each still have some candy left, and the information about the 84 pieces of candy is irrelevant to the solution.

Since the text states that Debby had 32 pieces initially and her sister had 42, let's assume these numbers are correct. Also, we know that they consumed 35 pieces of candy together on the first night. Now, we can calculate how many pieces of candy are left for each sister by finding the difference between their initial quantities and the quantity consumed: Debby had 32 pieces initially; she consumed 35 pieces during the first night => Debby has 32 - 35 = -3 pieces left (which is not possible).
