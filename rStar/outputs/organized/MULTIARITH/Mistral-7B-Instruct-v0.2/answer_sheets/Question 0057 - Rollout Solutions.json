First, we need to find out how many candies are left after Bianca eats 30 pieces. We know that she starts with 78 candies, and eats 30. That leaves us with 78 - 30 = 48 candies. To determine how many piles Bianca can create, we divide the number of remaining candies by the size of each pile. The question says \"equal piles\", so we assume that the size of each pile is equal. Let's call that size 'x'. Using simple algebra, we get x * NumberOfPiles = 48. We don't know the size of each pile yet, but we do know it must be a positive integer. Since this equation doesn't have enough information to solve directly for x or the NumberOfPiles, let me provide you with all possible valid solutions.\n\nTo create one pile with the remaining candies, the pile size must be greater than or equal to 48 (as there are 48 candies remaining).
