So he needs to cook the remaining 2 potatoes. Since it takes 3 minutes to cook one potato, it will take 2 x 3 = 6 minutes for him to cook all 2 potatoes. However, since the chef can only cook one potato at a time, he would need to cook each potato separately. Therefore, it will actually take 2 potatoes x 3 minutes = 6 minutes for the chef to cook both potatoes.
