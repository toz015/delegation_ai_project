Based on the provided hints, we know that there are 72 students in total, 26 of whom are boys and 46 who are girls. To find out how many distinct groups of 9 people can be formed, we use the formula C(n, r), which stands for combinations of n items taken r at a time. In this case, n equals 26, representing the number of boys, while r equals 9, representing the size of each group. We apply this formula as follows: C(26, 9).
