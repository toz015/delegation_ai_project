Adam began with 48 books (Condition 1). He sold 19 books for cash (Condition 2). To find out how many books Adam had left after selling those 19, we subtract them from his initial quantity: 48 - 19 = 29.

Let's call the money he had after the sale 'x'. We know that 19 * 3 = 57 (the price of 19 books) and 38 * p = x (where p is the price of one new book), so p = x / 38. Substituting this expression back into the equation that relates the money after the sale to the initial quantity of books, we get: 57 + 29 = x => x = 86.
