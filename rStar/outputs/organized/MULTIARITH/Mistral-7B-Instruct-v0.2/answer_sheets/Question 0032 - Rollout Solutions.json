She put 44 pictures in one album. That means there are 79 - 44 = 35 pictures left to be placed in other albums. Each of these 5 smaller albums contains an equal number of pictures. Since there are no leftover pictures, these 5 smaller albums must all contain 35/5 = 7 pictures.

Hence, the remaining pictures in each of the smaller albums would be 7 pictures. No picture was left out as stated above. However, if we need to find the number of pictures left unplaced or remained with Wendy, it would be 79 - (1 big album + 5 small albums) = 79 - (1*(44)+5*(7)) = 79 - 44 - 35 = 0.
