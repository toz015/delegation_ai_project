From condition 2, we know that she plants 29 seeds in her main garden. So she still has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds.\n\nSince each small garden receives 4 seeds, the number of small gardens would be the quotient of the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden, i.e., 12 / 4 = 3.\n\nHowever, the hint suggests that each small garden receives exactly 4 seeds. Therefore, it seems that there's an inconsistency between the problem statement and the hint. Let me check it again to make sure I haven't misunderstood anything.\n\nI have double checked the problem statement, and indeed there was a mistake in the problem description regarding the number of seeds per small garden (it should be 4 as stated in the hint).

Since one set of 4 seeds uses up 4 seeds, we can calculate the number of small gardens as follows: 12 / 4 = 3. However, since this is not a whole number, it means that there is one seed left over.

Emily plants 4 seeds in one small garden.\n\nLet's think step by step. We know Emily starts with 41 seeds, she plants 29 seeds in her main garden, and each small garden gets 4 seeds. Let's first find out how many seeds remain with Emily after planting the seeds in her main garden. Since Emily plants 29 seeds in her main garden and starts with 41 seeds, we can calculate how many seeds Emily plants in her small gardens as follows:\n\n41 (Emily's seeds) = 29 (seeds in main garden) + X (seeds in small gardens)\nX = 41 - 29 = 12\n\nSo Emily has 12 seeds left to distribute among her small gardens. As we know, each small garden gets 4 seeds, so the number of small gardens is equal to the number of seeds divided by the number of seeds per small garden:\n\nNumber of small gardens = Seeds / Seeds per small garden\n= 12 / 4\n= 3\n\nThe answer is: Emily has 3 small", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
