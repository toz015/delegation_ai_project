Going back to the initial data, we see that George had 30 dollars and then received 16 dollars. So, the correct calculation is: George starts with 30 dollars, gets 16 dollars, and spends 38 dollars. This leaves him with 30 + 16 - 38 = -2. Since this doesn't make sense, let's try another approach. Instead, we should calculate the money spent on the game first: 30 + 16 - 38 = -2. However, this result makes no sense because George cannot have a negative amount of money. We must have made a mistake earlier. To fix this, let's calculate the money George spent on the game first: 30 dollars - 16 dollars (birthday money) = 14 dollars. So, George had 14 dollars left after his birthday.

Spending 38 dollars results in having -22 dollars, which is incorrect. We made an error in our calculation. Instead, George initially had 30 dollars.
