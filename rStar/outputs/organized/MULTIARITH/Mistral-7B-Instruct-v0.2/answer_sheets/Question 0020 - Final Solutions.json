Let's check our calculation: The chef actually cooked 7 extra chicken wings for the group, so the actual number of chicken wings the friends received was 9 (prepared) + 7 (extra) = 16. Divide that number by the number of friends again: The answer is: 4 (each friend got 4 parts of a wing). However, since a whole wing is typically considered one serving, we should modify our previous answer. Each friend got 1 whole wing plus some remaining parts.
