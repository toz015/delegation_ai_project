The answer is 18.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. That means they removed 1/3 * 18 = 6 flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remaining."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos. On Saturday, 1/3 of them (which equals to 18 / 3 = 6) turned into white flamingos. After removing these, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos still remaining. On top of this, the neighbors added additional 18 pink flamingos, making it a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos on Sunday. Since all original 6 flamingos turned white, there was only 6 white flamingos. Hence, there were 30 - 6 = 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos on Sunday afternoon. The answer is: 24.", "value": 0.75}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
