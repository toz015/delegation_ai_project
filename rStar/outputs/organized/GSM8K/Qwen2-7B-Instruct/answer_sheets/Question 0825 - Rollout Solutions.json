How many cards does Becca have?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's call the number of cards that PJ has \\(x\\). Therefore, Smendrick has \\(3x\\) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, which means she has \\(3x + 12\\) cards.\n\nSince together they have 341 cards, we can write this as:\n\n\\[x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341\\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[7x + 12 = 341\\]\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides,\n\n\\[7x = 329\\]\n\nDividing by 7,\n\n\\[x = 47\\]\n\nSo, PJ has 47 cards. Now let's find out how many cards Becca has using \\(3x + 12\\):\n\n\\[3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\\]\n\nTherefore, Becca has 153 cards.\n\nThe answer is: 153.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
