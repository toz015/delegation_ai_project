Since Sara has already earned money from babysitting (four times), we need to account for those earnings first:\n\nEarnings from babysitting (4 times): $5 x 4 = $20\n\nThen subtract these earnings from the remaining amount Sara needs:\n\n$60 still needed - $20 earned = $40 still needed\n\nFinally, divide this remaining amount by her earnings per mowing:\n\n$40 / $4 earned per mow = 10 times she needs to mow the lawn.\n\nThe answer is: Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
