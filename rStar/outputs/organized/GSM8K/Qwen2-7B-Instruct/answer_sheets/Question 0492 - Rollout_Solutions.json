We know:\n\n- Small Stickers Traded for Large Buttons = 27\n- Large Stickers Traded for Large Buttons = 20 (from Hint 2)\n- Remaining Large Stickers = 40 original - 20 traded = 20 large stickers \n\nLorraine uses these steps to calculate her total buttons:\n\n1. Convert Small Stickers Traded into Large Buttons: Since each small sticker trades for a large button, she gets 27 large buttons directly.\n2. Convert Large Stickers Traded into Large Buttons: Each large sticker goes towards making a large button, hence she gets 20 large buttons from those.\n3. Convert Remaining Large Stickers into Small Buttons: With 20 large stickers remaining, since each large sticker equals 3 small stickers, she can convert these to get another 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.\n\nAdding all these together,\n\nTotal Buttons = Large Buttons From Trading + Small Buttons From Trading + Buttons From Remaining Large Stickers  \n= 27 (large) + 20 (large) + 60 (small)\n\nSo, Lorraine ends up with 27 large buttons + 20 large buttons +", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
