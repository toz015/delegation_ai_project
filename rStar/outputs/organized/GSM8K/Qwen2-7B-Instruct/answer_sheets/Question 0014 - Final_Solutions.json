Each train traveled 150 miles northwards on the second day. Since it was mentioned that both trains travel in the same direction (northwards) for this part of their journey, we can conclude that:\n\nEach train travels: 150 miles.\n\nSince the question asks specifically about the distance traveled by the trains on the second day, and since both trains cover the same distance in this segment of their journey, the answer would be:\n\nBoth trains together travel: 150 miles.\n\nHowever, if you meant to find out the distance covered collectively by both trains over the entire journey described (which includes the first part of 80 miles each way followed by the northward travel), we would add the distances separately because different times were spent on these portions.
