First, we add up the total amount both DVDs have been played: 356 + 135 = 491 times. Since together they can be played 1000 times before breaking, this means each DVD needs to account for half of these plays, because if you combine them back into one DVD, it would need to hold all 1000 plays. Therefore, divide 1000 by 2: \\( \\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \\). This means one DVD could theoretically play 500 times before it breaks. However, since the question seems to ask how many times one DVD can be played based solely on its current state without considering the total capacity when combined with another (which isn't specified), and based on common understanding, the question might be seeking the remaining life of one DVD when initially divided, which would be calculated as follows:\n\nGiven one DVD was already used 356 times out of 1000 possible uses, subtracting those used times from the total gives us how many times it could potentially still play before breaking: \n\\(1000 - 356 = 64", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Considering the context of calculating how many more times the first DVD could potentially be played, the calculation shows there are 640 times remaining for the first DVD before it breaks.
