Given that it originally costs $25 and there's a 30% off sale, we can find the discount amount as follows:\n\nDiscount amount for shirt = Initial price of shirt * Discount rate = $25 * 30% = $25 * 0.30 = $7.5\n\nSo the discount for the shirt is $7.5. \n\nNext, to determine the final cost of the shirt after applying the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:\n\nFinal cost of shirt = Initial price of shirt - Discount amount = $25 - $7.5 = $17.5\n\nThen, let\u2019s add the final cost of the shirt ($17.5) and the price of the shorts ($35):\n\nTotal cost before tax = Final cost of shirt + Price of shorts = $17.5 + $35 = $52.5\n\nSince all the costs include sales tax, but we're not explicitly given any information about calculating the actual tax amount in this scenario, we assume the tax has already been included in these prices.
