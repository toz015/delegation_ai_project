If Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can say if Jackson's age is J, then Amy's age is J+5.\nIf Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, then if Corey's age is C, then Amy's age is also C-2. Since Amy's age is consistent, we get two equations:\nJ + 5 = C - 2\nWe need to find out Corey's age (C). We can express J as C-7 based on the first equation (subtracting 5 from both sides).\nSo, the equation becomes:\nC - 7 + 5 = C - 2\nSimplifying it:\nC - 2 = C - 2\n\nThis simplification shows us that our expressions equate to each other correctly because they are just different ways of expressing the same relationship (Amy being 2 years younger than Corey).
