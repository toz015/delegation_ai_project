So, using the distance of 30 miles and his speed coming back as 6 mph, the time taken would be:\n\nTime taken = Distance / Speed\n           = 30 miles / 6 mph\n           = 5 hours\n\nSo it takes him 5 hours to get back.\nThe answer is: 5.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.
