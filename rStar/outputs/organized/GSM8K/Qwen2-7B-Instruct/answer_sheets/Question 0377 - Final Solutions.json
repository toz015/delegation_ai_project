If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many apples did Lucy sell on Monday?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let the quantity of apples Lucy sold on Monday be denoted as \\(x\\). From the information provided:\n\n- On Monday, she sold all the apples.\n- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.\n- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means she picked \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) apples on Wednesday.\n\nTo find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we can set up an equation based on the total amount she would earn if she sold all her apples at \\$4 per piece. \n\nGiven that selling all the apples equals the sum of the apples picked over three days (\\(x + 12 + 24\\)) multiplied by the price per apple (\\$4), we can write the following equation:\n\n\\[4(x + 12 + 24) = \\text{Total Revenue}\\]\n\nHowever, since we're only interested in finding \\(x\\), and knowing that she sold every single apple she ever picked (including those picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), we realize that the total revenue actually equals the sum of apples picked times the price per apple, because everything was sold.
