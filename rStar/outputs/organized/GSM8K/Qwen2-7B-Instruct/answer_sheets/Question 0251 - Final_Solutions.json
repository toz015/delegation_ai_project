This means that if we let T represent the total number of pieces, then .4T represents the faulty pieces. Since the faulty pieces make up 40%, this leaves 60% or .6T as the good pieces (since 100% - 40% = 60%). We're told that these 60% of the pieces equate to $400000 worth of equipment.\n\nWe can find the value represented by one percent by dividing the total amount by 100: $400000 / 100 = $4000.\n\nSince .6T equals $4000, we can set up an equation where .6T = $4000 to solve for T:\n\n\\[ .6T = \\$4000 \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by .6 to get T alone:\n\n\\[ T = \\$4000 / .6 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$6666.\\overline{6} \\]\n\nSo the company bought approximately $6666.67 worth of equipment per piece,", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many pieces were faulty?", "subanswer": {"text": "Given that the faulty pieces made up 40% of the total pieces, this would be:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's calculate the number of faulty pieces first. The faulty pieces amounted to 40% of the total number of pieces, which was calculated earlier to be approximately $6666.67 per piece. But since you cannot purchase a fraction of an item in this context, we round down to 6666 pieces purchased (since fractions of items weren't actually sold).\n\nThe faulty percentage translates into faulty pieces as follows:\n\n- 40% of total pieces = Faulty pieces\nTo convert percentage back into actual quantity, take the total pieces times the percentage in decimal form:\n\n\\[ \\text{Faulty Pieces} = 6666 \\times 0.4 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Faulty Pieces} = 2666.4 \\]\n\nAs you cannot have a fraction of a piece of equipment either, we'll need to consider just whole units. Hence, rounding down, the company had 2666 faulty pieces of equipment.\n\nThe question asks for the total money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, which would mean excluding the cost attributed to the faulty ones.
