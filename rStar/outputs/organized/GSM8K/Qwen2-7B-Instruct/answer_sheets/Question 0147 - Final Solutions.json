That would mean 2 * 30 = 60 bees flew out later in the day. Every bee that left before but hadn't returned yet would eventually come back, so we need to consider these factors in terms of returnees: From the original 30 bees that left, subtracting those who came back (15) leaves us with 30 - 15 = 15 bees still outside. Adding the new group of bees that also left (60), we have 15 + 60 = 75 bees that haven't yet returned. The last part specifies that all bees that left before but hadn't already returned do return to the hive. We've accounted for the 15 bees returning and adding the 60 bees that left later for good measure, meaning there weren't any additional bees to return. Therefore, only the previously calculated 15 bees return in the last 6 hours of the day. The answer is: 15.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
