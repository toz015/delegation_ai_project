{"id": 894, "problem": "Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars\nSince the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.\nAdding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars\nSubtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars\nTasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.\n#### 26", "gold_answer": "26"}
