First, find out how many oranges are not bad or sour. Since 1 orange is bad and 2 are sour, this means \\(25 - (1 + 2) = 22\\) oranges are either ripe and good or unripe. Given 20% are unripe, we can calculate the number of unripe oranges as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of unripe oranges} = 22 \\times 20\\% = 22 \\times 0.2 = 4.4 \\]\n\nSince the number of oranges cannot be fractional, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in calculating percentages directly without considering whole numbers. \n\nRevisiting our approach:\nWe know 1 is bad and 2 are sour, thus leaving 22 oranges potentially unripe or good. As 20% are unripe:\n\\[ \\text{Unripe oranges} = 22 \\times 20\\% = 22 \\times \\frac{20}{100} = 4.4 \\]\nHowever, since we're dealing with a countable item, rounding issues arise here; typically, such problems wouldn't round down the percentage if we strictly interpret", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "This rounding issue highlights an oversight in the interpretation\u2014when applying percentages to count items like oranges, we need exact counts rather than decimal approximations when dealing with whole objects.
