Since Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, let O be equal to 2W. Bob originally had 3 orange fish, but he also bought an unknown number of orange fish at the store. Since all the new fish he purchased were either orange or white, O (the total orange fish), will be made up of the initial 3 orange fish plus the ones he bought, resulting in O = 3 + X, where X represents the number of additional orange fish he bought. Similarly, since W represents the number of white fish bought and all other fish are white, the total number of white fish would simply be W because no other white fish were present initially and no others besides those he bought are being considered.
