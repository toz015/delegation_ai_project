There are 20 friends who want to eat pizza. Each friend gets 4 slices of pizza. This means all the friends together would eat 20*4=80 slices. To get these amount, we consider the size of the pizza which is sliced into 8 portions each time, so we divide the total required slices (80) by the slice portion of one pizza (8). Therefore, they need 80/8 = 10 pizzas.\n\nNow let's calculate the total amount of slices:\n\nThey need 80 slices of pizza altogether.\n\nThe answer is: 80.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many Pizzas does John need to order?", "subanswer": {"text": "John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure every one of his 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza.
