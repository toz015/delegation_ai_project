Marissa walked 4 miles in the first hour. Then, she walked 2 miles in the second hour. Altogether, in the first 2 hours, she hiked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. The answer is: 6.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Marissa needs to hike 12 miles altogether. She already hiked 6 miles. Therefore, she needs to hike 12 - 6 = 6 miles more. \n\nShe plans her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. Average speed is calculated as total distance divided by total time taken. Since she wants this average speed over all 12 miles, we know that total time taken for 12 miles would ideally be 12 / 4 = 3 hours.\n\nSince she already spent 2 hours walking, the time needed for the remaining 6 miles would be 3 - 2 = 1 hour.\n\nTo find out the required speed for the last part of the journey which is 6 miles in 1 hour, you can simply divide these numbers. This yields:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain her goal of having an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.\n\nThe answer is: 6", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 5}]
