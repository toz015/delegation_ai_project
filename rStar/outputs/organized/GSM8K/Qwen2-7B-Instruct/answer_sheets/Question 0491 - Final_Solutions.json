Jeff sent out 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. This means he initially sent out a total of 8 + 4 = 12 dozen items. However, we're only concerned about the glass count mentioned in your question, which was 8 dozen glasses. If you want to know how many dozens of glasses Jeff ended up with (assuming all 8 dozen were not returned), we would subtract the 10 broken glasses.
