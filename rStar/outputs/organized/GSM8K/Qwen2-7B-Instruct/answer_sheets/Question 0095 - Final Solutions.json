Let me clarify:\n\nWe're looking for how many girls are not in the Girl Scout club if out of 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys. This means 3/5 are girls since you can subtract the fraction representing boys from the whole. Thus, calculate (3/5) * 200 to find out how many girls there are. \n\nThen, if 2/3 of these girls are in the Girl Scout, this leaves 1/3 who aren\u2019t. You'll need to multiply the total number of girls by 1/3 to determine the number not participating in Girl Scouts.\n\nFirstly, calculating the number of girls:\n(3/5) * 200 = 120 girls\n\nIf 2/3 of these girls are in the Girl Scout, thus 1/3 aren\u2019t.\nTo figure out the girls not involved in Girl Scout: \n(1/3) * 120 = 40.\n\nSo, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scout.
