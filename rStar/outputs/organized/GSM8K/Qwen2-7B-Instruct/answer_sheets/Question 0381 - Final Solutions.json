Cho hikes at 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked 14 km/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiking information isn't needed to find out how far Cho hiked. The answer is: 112.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many kilometers farther did Cho hike?", "subanswer": {"text": "The answer is simply based on the distance calculated earlier, so Cho hiked 112 kilometers farther compared to Chloe if Chloe also hiked for 8 hours. But since the question asks specifically about how much farther Cho hiked, and no other distances or comparison points are provided, the direct answer would be \"Cho hiked 112 kilometers.\" The additional context implies comparing to Chloe under an incorrect assumption (Chloe hiking 8 hours instead of stopping after 5). Given the constraints of the provided data, Cho hiked 112 kilometers. The answer is 112.", "value": 0.5625}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
