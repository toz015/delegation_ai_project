{"id": 423, "problem": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.\nSo, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.\nThe original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.\nCole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28\nHence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.\nTherefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.\n#### 8", "gold_answer": "8"}
