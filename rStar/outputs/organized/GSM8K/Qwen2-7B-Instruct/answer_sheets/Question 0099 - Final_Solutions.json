First, find out how much was spent on food: That's $2 for milk + $3 for eggs + $3 for light bulbs + $3 for cups which makes it $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $11. Next, figure out how much was spent on non-food items: That's $6 (from light bulbs and cups). Now add any taxes. A 10% tax on the non-food items would mean an extra 10% of $6 is needed. 10% of $6 is calculated as ($6 * 10/100) = $0.6. Thus, adding this tax to the original price of non-food items gets you $6 + $0.6 = $6.6. Finally, combine these amounts: Total cost = Cost of food + Cost of taxed non-food items = $11 + $6.6 = $17.6.
