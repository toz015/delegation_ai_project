However, given our knowledge of weight per foot, we can also calculate the total original weight and subtract the consumed weight before determining the remaining height.\n\nSince the entire tree was originally 200 feet, without termites eating any part of it, each foot weighed 40 pounds. Therefore, originally, it weighed \\( 200 \\times 40 = 8000 \\) pounds.\n\nNow, since termites ate 30% of it, that means 30% of the weight was removed.
