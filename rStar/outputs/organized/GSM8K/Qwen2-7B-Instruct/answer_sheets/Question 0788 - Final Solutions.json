Knowing that one half of it is covered by the school doesn't specify what the other half costs or the total amount John needs to raise. Please provide either the amount the school covers or the full price of the trip so I can accurately calculate the total cost.

To cover the entire cost ($500 based on your initial information), John is short of $450 ($500 - $50). But since you've mentioned 'John misses $250', my understanding might not match your context. Based on your context, John has $50 but still needs another $250 (to meet the school's half) before covering his own half. The answer is 250.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
