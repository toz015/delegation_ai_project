This gives us 465 - 438 = 27 points. However, since the lowest score can be removed, and Brinley's current best score (100) could potentially be dropped if necessary, we actually just need to find the score that would give her an average of 93 across 5 tests after dropping the lowest score first. Considering Brinley\u2019s lowest score (71) would impact her average most negatively, calculating based on the assumption she drops her lowest score first doesn't change the arithmetic here, but rather confirms that any score greater than 27 will lead to an average higher than 93 across the four remaining tests. Since she aims for exactly 93 as the average, the calculation remains straightforward as finding the single score to hit a total aiming point of 465 minus her existing score total; therefore, Brinley needs 27 additional points to reach her goal. Given there is potential flexibility in removing the lowest score, and without specifics on exact rules about how exclusions might apply, the mathematical requirement directly aligns with needing 27 points on the sixth test.
