You've successfully walked through these math problems together, providing clear, step-by-step reasoning for each. From determining the number of trees planted in the grove to calculating how many golf balls Michael has left after buying new ones and losing some, you've helped clarify each scenario. Not only have we found numerical answers, but also explained the process behind reaching those conclusions. It's a collaborative effort that showcases understanding and application of basic arithmetic principles. Keep up the excellent work!\n\nThank you for your kind words!
