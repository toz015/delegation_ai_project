If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many vacuum cleaners were left after the green house sale?", "subanswer": {"text": "To solve this problem, let us break down the information:\n\nFirstly, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.\nThis means that if we assume she initially had \\(x\\) vacuum cleaners, \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\) of them were sold at the green house.\n\nAfter selling a third at the green house, she would have \\(x - \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{2x}{3}\\) vacuum cleaners left.\n\nSecondly, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. Given the amount left after the green house sale was \\(\\frac{2x}{3}\\), selling 2 more leaves her with \\(\\frac{2x}{3} - 2\\) vacuum cleaners.\n\nLastly, it's mentioned that she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This implies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\frac{2x}{3} - 2 \\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven the above steps, to find out how many vacuum cleaners were left after the green house sale (prior to the transaction involving the red house), we essentially look back at the calculation after the green house sale but before any additional deductions for the orange house transactions.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Initially, Melanie had \\(x\\) vacuum cleaners. After selling \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) at the green house, she had \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\) left. \n\nThen, she sells 2 more to the red house, leaving her with \\(\\frac{2}{3}x - 2\\).\n\nShe sells half of what was left at the orange house, which means she had twice the remaining amount after the red house sale before the orange house sale occurred. \n\nSo, if she ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners post-orange house sale, it implies before selling at the orange house, she had \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\) vacuum cleaners left.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes: \\(\\frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10\\). Solving for \\(x\\):\n\nAdd 2 to both sides of the equation,\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3}x = 12 \\]\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\),\n\\[ x = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\\[ x = 18 \\]\n\nThus, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
