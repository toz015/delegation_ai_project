So the additional cost is \\(20\\% \\times 20 = \\$4\\) per frame.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for each picture frame becomes \\(20 + 4 = \\$24\\).\n\nSince all 44 seniors get these picture frames, the total cost for picture frames is \\(44 \\times 24 = \\$1056\\).\n\n3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors**:\nEach pin costs $5. Since only 2 seniors are getting pins, the total cost for pins is \\(2 \\times 5 = \\$10\\).\n\nSo, **the total amount spent on pins for 2 of the seniors** is \\$10.\n\nThe answer is: \\$10.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, we calculate the total cost of picture frames without etching which would be 44 * $20 = $880. Adding the etching cost at 20%, it's $880 * 0.20 = $176. Hence, the total cost for frames after etching is $880 + $176 = $1056. Next, we find out how much is spent on pins for the 2 of the seniors, totaling $5 * 2 = $10. Lastly, for the 1/4 of the seniors who are officers, they need cords. As these are for 11 (1/4 of 44) seniors, and each costs $12, this amounts to $12 * 11 = $132. Finally, adding up all the expenses - the cost of frames after etching ($1056), cost of pins ($10), and cost of cords for officers ($132) gives us a total of $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1208.\n\nThe answer is: $1208.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
