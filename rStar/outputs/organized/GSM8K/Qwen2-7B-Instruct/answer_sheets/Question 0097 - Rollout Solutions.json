First, let's find out how many ounces correspond to one can before cooking them into sauce. This would be 16 * 2 = 32 ounces since she loses half their volume when cooking them into sauce.

This is done by dividing the total amount of sauce (in ounces) by the amount equivalent to one can (in ounces). That would be 32 / 32 = 1 can-worth of tomatoes converted into sauce. Lastly, because each can holds 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of can-worth equivalents by 3 to get the total amount of tomatoes Freda used.
