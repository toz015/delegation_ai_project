The cost of five hamburgers was previously calculated as 20 dollars. The cost of ten packs of potato fries is 3 dollars. Also, five cans of fruit drink cost 5 x 2 = 10 dollars. Thus, the total cost of all these items would be 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars. Since Carly pays using a 50 dollar bill, we just need to subtract the total cost from 50 to find out how much change she gets back. That is, 50 - 33 = 17 dollars.
