First, we need to figure out the space taken up by the topaz gemstones which is 8*1 = 8 inches since there are 8 gemstones and each is 1 inch. That means the remaining space is taken by the sterling silver beads. Since the whole necklace needs to be 25 inches long, subtracting the space taken by gemstones leaves us with 25-8=17 inches for the beads. Next, consider that each sterling silver bead is only a quarter-inch wide. To find out how many beads can fit into this 17-inch space, divide the total available space by the size of each bead: 17 / (1/4) = 17 * 4 = 68 beads.
