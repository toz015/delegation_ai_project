First, find out how much the laptop costs after trading in her old one: $600 - $200 = 400\\. Next, calculate the total amount Erika has gotten so far: $150 (from her part-time job) + $80 (from her mom) = $230\\. To find out how much money Erika has left in her purse, subtract what she currently needs ($50) from the total amount she has collected ($230). The calculation is as follows: $230 - $50 = $180\\. The answer is: Erika has $180 in her purse.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
