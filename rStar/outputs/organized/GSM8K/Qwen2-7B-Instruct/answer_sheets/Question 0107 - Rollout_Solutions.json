Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's denote X as the original number of French fries.\n\nFirstly, we know Dave ate 14 fries.\nThen, a seagull came and ate half of what Dave had already eaten which means,\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} * 14 = 7 \\]\nSo, after this event, there would be\n\\[ X - (14 + 7) = X - 21 \\]\n\nNext, three pigeons each ate 3 fries so that's\n\\[ 3 * 3 = 9 \\] fries eaten by pigeons.\n\nTherefore, after these pigeons ate their shares, the remaining fries would be\n\\[ X - 21 - 9 = X - 30 \\]\n\nThen, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries remaining. Since two-thirds represents the part stolen by the raccoon, one-third remains. Thus, if \\(Y\\) represents the number of fries before the raccoon, \\( \\frac{1}{3} Y \\) is what remained, or equivalently, \\( Y - \\frac{2}{3} Y = \\frac{1}{3} Y \\).
