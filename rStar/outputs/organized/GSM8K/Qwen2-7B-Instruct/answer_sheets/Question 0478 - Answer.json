{"id": 736, "problem": "Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, how many fewer apples does Beck have than Boris now?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.\nBeck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.\nHowever, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.\nThus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
