Here's how it works:\n\n1. You calculated the amount the second bank provided, which was double the first bank's contribution.\n   - First bank: $4000\n   - Second bank (double): $4000 * 2 = $8000\n\n2. Next, add up all the capitals Mr. Josue received from both banks and his initial capital:\n   - Initial capital: $5000\n   - Total from banks: $4000 (first bank) + $8000 (second bank) = $12000\n\n3.
