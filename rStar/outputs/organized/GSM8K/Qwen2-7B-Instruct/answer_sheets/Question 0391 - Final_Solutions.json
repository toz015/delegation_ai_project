Based on the hint, we know one pump of shampoo can be used 12 times. The jumbo bottle contains 24.00 worth of shampoo and has enough to last for 120 washes using the recommended 2 pumps per wash. This means the whole bottle can provide 120 * 2 = 240 pumps worth of shampoo. One pump would therefore cost part of the $24.00, specifically $24.00 / 12 = $2.00. To convert this into cents, multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents). Hence, each pump costs 2.00 * 100 = 200 cents.\n\nThe answer is: 200.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
