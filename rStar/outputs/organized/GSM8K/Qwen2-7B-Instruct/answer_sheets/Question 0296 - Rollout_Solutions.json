Without using the super ticket but still getting popcorn plus a soda for $2 less than $21 means you would spend $21-$2=$19 instead. Since a regular soda costs $3, let \\(x\\) be the cost of the popcorn. Thus, adding the popcorn and soda to your $12 movie ticket should equal $19 because you spent $19. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[12 (movie ticket) + x (popcorn) + 3(soda) = 19\\]\n\nRearrange this equation to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x + 3 = 19 - 12\\]\n\\[x + 3 = 7\\]\n\\[x = 7 - 3\\]\n\\[x = 4\\]\n\nThus, the regular price of a popcorn is $4. \n\nThe answer is: 4.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
