{"id": 696, "problem": "Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can go on a trip. In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.\nBetty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.\nTom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.\nMarta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.\nIn total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.\nSo the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.\n#### 145", "gold_answer": "145"}
