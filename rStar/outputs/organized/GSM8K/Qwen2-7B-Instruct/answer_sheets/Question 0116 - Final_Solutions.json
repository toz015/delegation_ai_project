This is because if she hires the accountant it costs her $90, but by doing it herself she misses out on $105 (the income she could've earned). \n\nTo find out exactly how much Jackie loses by choosing to do her taxes herself versus using an accountant, we need to compare these two amounts:\n\n- Cost of accountant: $90\n- Potential income loss by doing her own taxes: $105\n\nBy doing her own taxes, Jackie would lose $105 compared to the cost of $90 if she hired an accountant. Therefore, the net loss by doing her own taxes versus hiring an accountant is $105 - $90 = $15.\n  \nSo Jackie would lose $15 by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring the accountant.\n\nThe answer is: $15.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?", "subanswer": {"text": "If Jackie hires the accountant, she will pay $90, whereas she would potentially lose $105 if she tries to do the taxes herself.
