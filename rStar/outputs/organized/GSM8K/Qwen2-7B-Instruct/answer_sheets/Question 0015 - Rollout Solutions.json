By increasing it by 2.5%, the new price becomes $5,000 * (1 + 2.5/100) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125. Profit made on jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.\n\nFor the electronic gadgets: Initial price $8,000. By increasing it by 1.2%, the new price becomes $8,000 * (1 + 1.2/100) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096. Profit made on electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.\n\nTherefore, choosing the jewelry results in higher profit ($125) than choosing electronic gadgets ($96).\n\nThe answer is: $125.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
