{"id": 694, "problem": "Tomorrow, 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending a function at Mia\u2019s restaurant. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. If there are 8 high chairs, how many more chairs does she have to get?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs\nThe total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs\nHowever, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people\nMia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
