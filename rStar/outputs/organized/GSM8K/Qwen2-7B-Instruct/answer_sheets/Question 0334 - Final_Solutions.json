Joe threw 25 punches every minute. The fight lasted 3 minutes per round so, he threw 25*3= 75 punches per round. The fight was divided into 5 rounds therefore he threw 75*5= 375 punches through all 5 rounds. Since we want to find out how many punches he threw per minute during the fight, divide the total punches thrown (375) by the total minutes fought (3x5 = 15). Thus, the calculation is 375/15 = 25 punches per minute. \n\nThe answer is: 25.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many punches did Joe throw?", "subanswer": {"text": "Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute and fights for a total of 15 minutes.
