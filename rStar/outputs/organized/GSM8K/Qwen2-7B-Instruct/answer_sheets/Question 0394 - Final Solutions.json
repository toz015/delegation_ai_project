First, find out how many books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system according to the instruction. This means \\(20 + \\text{double the number of books}\\). Since we're not provided the exact final number Wendy aims for directly but asked about double the number initially, let\u2019s calculate directly without finding the specific final quantity. \n\nDouble the number of books would simply mean multiplying the desired number by 2. Therefore, to get back to finding 'double', we don't actually need to perform the entire calculation laid out initially since this asks for 'double'. Hence:\n\nDouble the number of books Wendy wants to place is effectively twice what Wendy aims for.\n\nSince the problem statement doesn't specify how many books Wendy aims to put altogether, focusing instead on asking for 'double' makes it clear any value that represents the total desired (which was never quantified beyond needing to add 20) when doubled, is just that initial goal times 2.
