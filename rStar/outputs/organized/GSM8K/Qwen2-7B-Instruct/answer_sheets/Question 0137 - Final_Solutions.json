From hint 1 we know the red chickens produce 3*x eggs per day. According to hint 2, the white chickens produce 5*(x+2) eggs daily. Combined, they produce 3x + 5(x+2) = 8x + 10 eggs per day. Given that this sum equals 42, we can set up the equation 8x + 10 = 42. Solving for x:\n\nFirstly, subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32,\nThen divide by 8 on both sides: x = 4.\n\nTherefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
