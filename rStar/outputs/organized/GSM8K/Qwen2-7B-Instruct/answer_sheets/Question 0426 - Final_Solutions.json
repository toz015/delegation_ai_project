James gets 1 hour free when booking 4 hours (from 5 PM to 9 PM). That means he pays for 4 - 1 = 3 hours. The first paid hour costs $15. Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one. So, the second hour costs 2 * $15 = $30 and the third hour also costs $30 because it\u2019s just twice the price of the first paid hour. Hence, for three hours, he spends 1st hour + 2nd hour + 3rd hour = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75. The answer is: 5 PM to 9 PM.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much did he pay?", "subanswer": {"text": "James paid a total of $75 for using the horse-drawn carriage.
