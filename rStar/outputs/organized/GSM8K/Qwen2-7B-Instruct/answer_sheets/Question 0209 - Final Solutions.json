From Hint 2 we know that the total cost for the half dozen plates (which equals the full dozen since you're dealing with half) was $6000. Hint 3 tells us that the difference in cost between these plates and the cups is $1200. Given this information, if we subtract the difference ($1200) from the cost of the plates ($6000), we get the total cost of all the cups combined: $6000 - $1200 = $4800. Since this total cost applies to the entire batch of 240 cups, we can find the price per cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups: $4800 / 240 = $20.
