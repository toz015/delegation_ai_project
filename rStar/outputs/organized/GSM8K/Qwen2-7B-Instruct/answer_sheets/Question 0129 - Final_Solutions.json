First, we calculate the value of the 5% raise over the original salary. Let X represent John's original salary.\nThe 5% raise can be represented as 0.05X.\nSo, the new salary (after the raise) is X + 0.05X = 1.05X.\nNow, if you want to find out the additional amount per week based on this percentage increase, you need to divide this amount by the number of weeks in a year, assuming the question refers to a yearly figure rather than a monthly one since typically salaries don't vary month-to-month for raises of this nature unless specifically stated otherwise.\nHowever, it's worth noting that in real-life scenarios, most companies provide annual performance reviews or pay adjustments, which means any raise would not necessarily translate into a consistent weekly addition to salary due to the way the annual salary is calculated and distributed throughout the year.\nFor simplicity, let's proceed under the assumption that you're asking for the absolute value of the increased salary for the entire year only, not its effect on weekly salary:\n\nOriginal annual salary is X * 1.05 (since there's a 5% increase).\nThe difference, which represents the raise,", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Assuming John gets the raise on the first day of the year, what is his total salary for that year including both his original salary and the raise?", "subanswer": {"text": "John originally makes $2000 a week.
