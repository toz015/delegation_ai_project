Let's represent the unknowns using variables:\n\n- Let \\(R\\) represent the number of candies Robert has.\n- Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has \\(R + 6\\).\n- And since John has twice as many candies as Robert, John has \\(2R\\).\n\nHowever, without additional information about how many candies James or John actually has, we can't solve this directly. We need either the amount of candies that James or John has, or another relationship involving these quantities to find out exactly how many candies Robert has. As it stands, the problem cannot be solved for a specific numerical value for \\(R\\) based solely on the information provided. \n\nTherefore, the solution would involve setting up equations but would ultimately lead us back to expressing everything in terms of one variable (\\(R\\)) because the necessary values aren't provided:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of candies Robert has} = R \\]\n\nWithout further details about the amounts of candies held by James or John, we conclude that the question needs more information to provide a definitive numeric answer.
