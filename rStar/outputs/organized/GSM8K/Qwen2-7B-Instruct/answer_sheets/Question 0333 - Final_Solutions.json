Based on the initial statement, Tara bought \\(8\\) packs of \\(5\\) canvas bags each, totaling \\(8 \\times 5 = 40\\) bags. \n\nNow, let's calculate the profit. First, find out how much Tara spent on buying all the bags, which was \\(\\$4\\) per pack (since there are \\(5\\) bags in a pack and each costs \\$4). Hence, the total cost of buying \\(40\\) bags was \\(8 \\times 4 = \\$32\\).\n\nThen, determine how much she earned from selling them. She sold each bag for \\$8, so the total sales amounted to \\(40 \\times 8 = \\$320\\).\n\nTo find the profit, subtract the total cost (\\$32) from the total sales (\\$320):\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\$320 - \\$32 = \\$288. \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Tara earned a profit of \\$288 on her bags.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
