The initial count was 250 books.\nThe current year has 50 unsold books, thus:\nSold in the last three years = Initial count - Unsold books\nSold in the last three years = 250 books - 50 books\n\nShe sold twice as many books in the first year than in the current year. Let\u2019s denote the number of books sold in the current year as \\(x\\). Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is \\(2x\\).\nSo we can write:\n\\(2x + x + Sold_{in\\_second\\_year} = Sold_{in\\_last\\_three\\_years}\\)\n\nFrom above, we found the number of sold books over the last three years was:\n\nSold in the last three years = 200 books\n\nPlugging this into our equation gives us:\n\n\\(2x + x + Sold_{in\\_second\\_year} = 200\\)\n\\(3x + Sold_{in\\_second\\_year} = 200\\)\nBut it is stated that her sales number this year is 45, so:\n\n\\(x =text { This", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
