But, given the specific query about counting the cars 'during lunch break', it seems the clarification needed is emphasizing the observation made post-lunch without requiring another mathematical calculation beyond confirming the 35 cars remaining, because those details encapsulate the context of 'lunch break'. The answer is that during lunch break, Hunter observed 35 cars. Please note, this final part might need a bit more clarification regarding whether the aim is merely summarizing the situation at the end of lunch (which would be 35 cars) or asking again for the calculation process leading to this outcome. In either case, focusing on summarizing the scenario post-lunch aligns closely with recognizing the 35 cars visible then.", "value": 0.875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
