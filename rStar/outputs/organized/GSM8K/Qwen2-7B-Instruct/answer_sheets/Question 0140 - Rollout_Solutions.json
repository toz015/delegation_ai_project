Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much water was lost from each pool in the last four minutes?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let B represent the amount of water (in gallons) in the big pool now, and let S represent the amount of water in the small pool now.\nWe know that there are leaks in both pools that drain 4 gallons per minute.\nSo we can write the following equations based on the information:\n\n- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:\n\\[B - 4 \\times 4 = 2(S - 4 \\times 4)\\]\nWhich simplifies to\n\\[B - 16 = 2S - 32\\]\n\n- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:\n\\[B = 4S\\]\n\nWe can substitute \\(B\\) in the first equation from the second equation:\n\n\\[4S - 16 = 2S - 32\\]\n\nNow solve for \\(S\\):\n\n\\[2S = -32 + 16\\]\n\n\\[2S = -16\\]\n\n\\[S = -8 / 2\\]\n\n\\[S = -4\\]\n\nHowever, since you cannot have negative quantity of water, it seems like there might have been a mistake in forming or solving", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Review and correct calculation based on understanding:", "2": "Understand that both pools lose water at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute. This means we're comparing volumes lost over time rather than current volume."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Since the pools lose water at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute, let's denote the initial amount of water lost by x for the small pool and 2x for the big pool (since it had twice as much). Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. \n\nSo if y represents the current amount of water in the small pool, then the big pool would hold 4y now.\n\nGiven, both pools lost water for 4 minutes:\n\n- Small pool loses: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) gallons.\n- Big pool loses: \\(2 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 32\\) gallons.\n\nAt first, big pool was twice small pool which means initially,\n\\[BigPool_Initial = 2(SmallPool_Initial)\\]\n\nAfter losing water for 4 mins,\n\n\\[BigPool_Current = 4 \\times SmallPool_Current\\]\n\nWe also know that difference in their initial amounts equals the total loss,\n\\[SmallPool_Initial - BigPool_Initial = 32 - 16\\]\n\\[= 16\\] gallons.\n\nFrom the equation\n\\[BigPool_Initial = = = 4 \\Big", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
