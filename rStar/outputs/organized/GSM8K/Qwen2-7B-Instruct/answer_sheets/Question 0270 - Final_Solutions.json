Considering every animal, regardless of species, possesses one head, and knowing camels give us an additional 180 heads over a hypothetical scenario where they're represented by dromedaries alone, we deduce the number of dromedaries directly from the total heads and the premise set by their respective hump counts. With each camels accounting for an additional head above the simple headcount assumption, and recognizing there are no other animal types considered besides camels and dromedaries, subtracting the total heads accounted for by the extra camel attributes allows us to find the pure headcount, which aligns with the definition of \"heads.\" Since the 180 heads already represent the total population considering the unique attribute of camels having multiple humps compared to the singular representation of dromedaries, the direct answer to the question about dromedary numbers derived from this understanding is implied within this context. Here, recognizing each animal has at least one head, and the distinction between entities isn't directly quantified but rather through their unique characteristics (humps), the question simplifies to acknowledging the total provided as indicative of the combined population without explicit subtraction or addition required for clarification.
