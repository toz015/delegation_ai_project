{"id": 726, "problem": "Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes.  If the length of one of Topher\u2019s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one of Bobby\u2019s shoes?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since Topher\u2019s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.\nIf we let the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes, in inches, be x.\nThen the length of Topher\u2019s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.\nSubtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90\nSolving for x, the length of one of Bobby\u2019s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
