{"id": 804, "problem": "Two cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour when the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.  If both cars continue on the highway at the same speed, how many miles will separate them after 2 hours?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.\nSimilarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.\nThus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
