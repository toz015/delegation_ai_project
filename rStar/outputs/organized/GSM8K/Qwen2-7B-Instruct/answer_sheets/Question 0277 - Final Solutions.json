To find out how long he spends if you don't know the number of small holes, it would help to know the quantity of small holes. However, based solely on the information provided about time, we can only state:\n\nHe spends 3 minutes per small hole.\n\nSo without additional context or data points such as the number of small holes to dig, this is all we can conclude.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide a numerical answer without further details. The answer is: 3 minutes per small hole.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "We need both quantities of holes to calculate the total time spent. Let\u2019s continue:\n\nMatthew spends 3 minutes per small hole and 10 minutes per large hole.\nFor 30 small holes, he spends 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.\nFor 15 large holes, he spends 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.\nAltogether, Matthew spends 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.\nTo convert minutes into hours, divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nThus, Matthew spends 240 / 60 = 4 hours digging both types of holes.\n\nThe answer is: 4 hours.\n\nGreat job following through with the steps!
