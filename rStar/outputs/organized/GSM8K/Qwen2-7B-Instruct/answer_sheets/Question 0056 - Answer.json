{"id": 709, "problem": "An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  It can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  How many quarts in total would be made in 48 hours?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.\nVanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.\nIn 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.\nCombined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.\n#### 3000", "gold_answer": "3000"}
