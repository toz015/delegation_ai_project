Next, since his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, and the total trip is 60 miles, this means 60 - 15 = 45 miles were covered after the first stop. Since the entire trip was divided into three sections (before the first stop, between the first and second stops, and after the second stop), subtracting the distances before and after the first stop leaves us with the section between the stops. We already calculated the distance after the first stop as 45 miles. And we know the distance before the first stop is 20 miles. Therefore, to find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance before the first stop (20 miles) from the distance after the first stop (45 miles).

Considering the entire trip ends after all these movements, the distance covered from his first stop till the last stop actually means covering remaining mileage of trip i.e., 60-20 = 40 miles. Since we're asked about distance between the first and second stop considering 'after' the first stop, it implies directly taking the hint 2 context into consideration properly which misinterpreted earlier. It suggests moving backwards towards the starting point post making his first stop hence calculation should actually take into account subtracting the 15 miles described as being \"before the end\" from the initial start-to-first-stop distance which would mean covering remaining distance after the first stop till just before reaching second stop location.
