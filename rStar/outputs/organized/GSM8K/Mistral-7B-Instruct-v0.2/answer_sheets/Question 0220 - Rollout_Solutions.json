Since there's a small difference, it's easiest to just round down for everyone except DJ, who gets extra guns, so he can keep the remainder: 23 / 4 = 5.75 -> 6 guns per person, but Nick and Richard only get 5, and DJ gets 8 instead. So each of them ends up with 5 (Nick and Richard) or 8 (DJ) guns. The answer is: Nick and Richard have 5 guns each, while DJ has 8 guns.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Nick, Richard, Jason and DJ each have paintball guns.
