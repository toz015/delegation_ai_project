Time spent traveling by car is 6 hours and average driving speed is 50 mph."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Traveling by car took 6 hours. Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled, we multiply time spent traveling by the average speed. So the distance traveled by driving is 6 hours * 50 miles/hour = 300 miles.\n\nNext, let's find the distance covered by hiking. We know it took 1.5 hours and their hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, which means it's 5 miles per hour / 2 = 2.5 miles per hour. To find the distance traveled by hiking, we multiply the time spent hiking by the hiking speed. So the distance traveled by hiking is 1.5 hours * 2.5 miles/hour = 3.75 miles.\n\nFinally, to find the total distance traveled to reach the vacation spot, we add the distances covered by both driving and hiking. So the answer is 300 miles (driving) + 3.75 miles (hiking) = 303.75 miles.
