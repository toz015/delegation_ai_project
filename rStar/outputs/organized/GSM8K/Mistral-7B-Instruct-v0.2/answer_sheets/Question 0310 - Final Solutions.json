Since each business suit costs $100, the price of 5 business suits (the price of one more than the number of his business partners) would be 5 * 100 = $500. The difference between the cost of these 5 suits and the cost of his flight ticket is $700. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is 500 + 700 = $1200. Finally, Theo saved $2000 for the trip.
