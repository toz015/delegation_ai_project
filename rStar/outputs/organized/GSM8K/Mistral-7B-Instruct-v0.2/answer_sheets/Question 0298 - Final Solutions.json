Carmen started bidding at 200 dollars. Each person bid an additional 50 dollars. That means that each of the other three people bid once for every cycle of increasing bids. To find out how many cycles it took for Carmen to win, we need to know how much more than her last bid was compared to her first bid. That difference is 50 dollars (the amount one bid increases), so if we divide the final price she paid by this difference, we get the number of cycles: final price / difference = cycles. Carmen paid $200 + ($50 * n) for n cycles, where n is the number of bids made by others. We want to find n, so we rearrange the equation as follows: n = (final price - initial price) / difference. Substituting the values we know gives us n = ($200 + ($50 * n) - $200) / $50 = n = ($50 * n) / $50 = n = 4n/1 = 4n.

Since x is an integer, x must be divisible by 4. This means that the minimum value for x is 4. So the minimum number of bids made by others before Carmen wins is 4. Since Carmen bids each time someone else bids, she makes 4+1=5 bids in total. The final price includes all the previous bids plus Carmen's final bid, which is 5 bids * $50 = $250.
