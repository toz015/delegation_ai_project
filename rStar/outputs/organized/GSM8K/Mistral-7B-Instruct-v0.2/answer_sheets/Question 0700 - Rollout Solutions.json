First, let's figure out how many fireworks she'll see from her house: there are 15 boxes of fireworks in the city, and she can see 40% of them. So, she'll see 15 * 20 (the number of fireworks in one box) * 0.4 (her view percentage) = 600 fireworks from afar. Next, we'll calculate how many fireworks she sets off herself: 3 boxes of fireworks, each containing 5 fireworks, equals 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks. Putting it all together, Hannah will see a grand total of 600 (from the city's display) + 15 (from her own backyard) = 615 fireworks. The answer is: 615.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
