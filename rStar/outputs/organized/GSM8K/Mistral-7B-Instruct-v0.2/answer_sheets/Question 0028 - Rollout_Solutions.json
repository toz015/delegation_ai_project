Half of this is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels. Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of what Raymond has, that means Aaron has 5 + 20 = 25 jewels. Now we know Aaron has 25 jewels. We also know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to subtract 2 from Aaron's amount of jewels. 25 - 2 = 23.
