If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.\nIn total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.\nPeter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.\nHe also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.\nIn total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.\nThe total number of socks and dishes they both have is 90+90 = <<90+90=180>>180\n#### 180", "gold_answer": "180"}
