Since the number of fish must be integral, we can discard this fractional answer and instead look for another solution where the difference between the numbers of white and orange fish is smaller than 3. We find that when x=2, the numbers of white and orange fish are both 5, which fits the problem description. Therefore, Bob bought 2 white fish at the store.

Initially, Bob had 7 total fish, and 4 were white. Since he wanted twice as many orange fish as white fish, let X = the number of orange fish. We know X = 4W (where W is the number of white fish). Since there were 7 fish in total, we can write an equation: X + W = 7. Solving this equation, we find X = 3W. Substituting X = 4W into X = 3W, we get 4W = 3W + 7. Solving this equation, we find W = 1. So, there were initially 4 white fish. Bob ended up with 7 + 17 = 24 fish. Let Y = the number of new white fish he bought.
