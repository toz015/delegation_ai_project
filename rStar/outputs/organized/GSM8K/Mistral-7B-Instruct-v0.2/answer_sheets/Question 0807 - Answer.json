Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.\nWith those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.\nThus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.\n#### 4", "gold_answer": "4"}
