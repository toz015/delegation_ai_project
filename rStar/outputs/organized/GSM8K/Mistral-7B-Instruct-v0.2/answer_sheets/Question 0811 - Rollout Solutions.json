Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25. During the week he made $105. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the total amount Felix earned during the week. The problem states he made $105.", "2": "Convert the time period from weeks to days since there are 7 days in a week. There are 1 week * 7 days/week = 7 days in a week."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Felix made 105 dollars in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he made this amount by climbing a certain number of branches every day. That number times 7 equals 105. So we divide 105 by 7. The answer is: 15 (rounded). However it seems unlikely he would earn 15 dollars per branch considering the price mentioned earlier. This might be an error in the input data.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
