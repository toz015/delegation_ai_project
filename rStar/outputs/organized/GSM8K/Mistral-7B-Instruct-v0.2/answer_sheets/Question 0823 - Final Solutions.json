We know Sasha scored 14 less points in the second game than Julie scored in the first game, so the difference between their scores is 14. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 14 = -4. But it doesn't make sense for a person to score a negative number of points, so we made an error. We assumed Sasha scored fewer points in the second game when actually she scored more points. Therefore, Julie scored 6 fewer points than Sasha's score in the second game. This means Sasha scored Julie's score - 6 points. Let's find Julie's score in the second game. We know that the difference between their scores was 14.
