Condition 3: The city council would fine Ron $120 for fixing it himself. Condition 4: Ron must buy 3 buckets of asphalt, which each cost $25. Question: How much money does Ron save by taking matters into his own hands and fixing the pothole instead of waiting for the city to address it?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, his car will be damaged for 450 dollars. The city won't fix it and will even fine him 120 dollars if he does. To fix it himself, he needs to spend 25 dollars per bucket, times 3 buckets, so 25*3=75 dollars. Therefore, he saves 450 (car damage) - 120 (fine) - 75 (asphalt) = 255 dollars. The answer is: Ron saves 255 dollars.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 21}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house.
