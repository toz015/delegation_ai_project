However, since there is a 30% discount, the total cost of the outfit is actually reduced by 30%. To calculate this, we can set up an equation: Total cost before discount = Total cost after discount / (1 - Discount percentage). Using this formula, we find: 60 = 60 / (1 - 0.3) => 60 = 60 / 0.7 => 60 = 85.71. Since we know that the sales tax is included, it means that the actual cost of the outfit was 60 dollars, but before sales tax, it was 85.71. Since Joe started with 50 dollars, he doesn't have enough money for the outfit and would need to find a different option. Therefore, no final answer applies in this scenario.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
