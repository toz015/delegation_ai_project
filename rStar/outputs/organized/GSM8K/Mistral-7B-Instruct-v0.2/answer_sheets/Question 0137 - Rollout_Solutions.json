However, since we know from the question that y is an even number, it should be greater than 16 (x+1), because if y = 15, the number of red chickens (x) would not be an integer. Since the smallest possible difference between x and y is 2, then the smallest possible value of y would be x+2 => y = 16. Thus, Jerry has 14 red chickens.
