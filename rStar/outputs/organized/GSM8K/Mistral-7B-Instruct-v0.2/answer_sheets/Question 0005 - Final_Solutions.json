If x equals the cheap glasses, then 16-x equals the normal-priced glasses. If all glasses were normal-priced, they would cost 5 * 16 = 80. However, some of these glasses are cheap, so we multiply the number of cheap glasses by 0.6 * 5, since the cheaper ones will be 40 percent off. This results in 80 - (0.6 * 5) * (16 - k). Simplifying this expression, we find that 0.6(16-k) = 16 - k. Subtracting 16 from both sides and adding k to both sides, we get 0.6k=k-16. Subtracting k from both sides, we obtain 0.6k - k = -16. Subtracting 0.6k from both sides, we find -0.4k=-16. Dividing both sides by -0.4, we get k=40. But this is not possible because there are only 16 glasses. Therefore, let\u2019s try something else. Let n represent the number of normal-priced glasses, and let c represent the number of discounted glasses. Then, n+c = 16. Multiplying this equation by 5, we get 5n+5c = 80. Multiplying the first equation by 0.6 and subtracting this result from the second equation, we get 5n+5c-(3n)=80-(3c), which simplifies to 2n+5c=80-3c. Adding 3c to both sides and subtracting 80 from both sides, we get 2n+8c=80-80, or equivalently, 2n+8c=0. Now we need to solve this system of equations by subtracting 8 times the first equation from the second one. Doing this yields 5n+5c-8(n+c)=80-8(16), which simplifies to -3n-3c=80-128. Dividing both sides of this equation by -3, we find that n+c=16. However, since we already knew this, we won\u2019t use it.

Question 6: In the year 2000, five students started their own business together in the USA. By the end of the 2017, they had sold over 500 products. If the sales increased exponentially by a factor of 5 per year, how many products had they sold by the end of the 2020? Question 6.1: How many times did the number of products sold increase between 2000 and 2020? Answer 6.1: 2020 - 2000 = 20. However, we know the sales increased exponentially by a factor of 5 per year. That means the number of products sold increases 5^20 times. The answer is 9765625. Question 6.2: Now we can answer the question: How many products had they sold by the end of the 2020? Answer 6.2: At the beginning, there were 500 products. After four less than a dozen more fireflies joined in total. Then, two of the fireflies flew away. There were 8 fireflies who joined. Two of the fireflies flew away later, so three fireflies were dancing originally. They had sold over 500 products by the end of the 2017, so 9765625 * 500 > 500.
