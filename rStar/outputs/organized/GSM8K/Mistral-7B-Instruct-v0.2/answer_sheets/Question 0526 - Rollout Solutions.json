Before the new device, Ada consumed 12 kilowatts per hour daily. That means she used 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatt hours per week. With the new device, she uses 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour daily. This leads to a weekly consumption of 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatt hours per week. So the difference is 98 - 84 = 14 kilowatt hours or 14 * $1.50 = $21.
