We know Mr. Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so there are now 45 goats in Farm X. He also sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is 45 * 2 = 90 goats. Together they now have 45 (from Farm X) + 90 (from Farm Y) = 135. The answer is: 135.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
