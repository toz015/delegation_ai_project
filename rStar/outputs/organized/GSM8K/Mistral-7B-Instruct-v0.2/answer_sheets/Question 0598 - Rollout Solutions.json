Condition 1: 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies represent Colby's available change. Condition 2: One gumball costs a nickel. Question: How many gumballs can Colby afford to purchase with his coins?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine the total number of cents Colby has. Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters are worth 8 * 25 = 200 cents. Dimes are worth 10 cents each, so 6 dimes are worth 6 * 10 = 60 cents. Nickels are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels are worth 14 * 5 = 70 cents. Pennies are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies are worth 15 * 1 = 15 cents. The total value of Colby's coins is 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.", "2": "Divide the total number of cents by the cost of one gumball to determine how many gumballs Colby can buy. Each gumball costs 5 cents, or 5 cents / 1 gumball = 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, divide the total number of cents by the cost of one gumball. 345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs. However, since Colby cannot buy a fraction of a gumball, he can only buy 69 gumballs.", "3": "The answer is 69.", "4": "Alternatively, you could calculate the number of nickels Colby has and then divide by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy. But this method would not be as efficient. Colby has 14 nickels, so 14 nickels * 5 cents per nickel = 70 cents worth of nickels. Since he also has quarters, dimes, and pennies, we know he has more than enough nickels for 69 gumballs."}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
