Cats have 4 legs each, so they have 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs. Birds can have either 2 or 4 legs depending if it's a bird like a chicken or an ostrich respectively. Since no information was given about the specific birds in this case, let's assume that they all have 2 legs and thus 10 birds would have 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Putting everything together, the total number of legs for the 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds is 20 legs (for the dogs) + 8 legs (for the cats) + 20 legs (for the birds) = 48 legs.
