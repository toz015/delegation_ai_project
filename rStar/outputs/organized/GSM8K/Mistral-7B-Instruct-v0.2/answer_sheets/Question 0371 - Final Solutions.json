To determine how many pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Saturday, let's first recall what Condition 2 tells us about sales on Saturday. It states that the store doubled its sales from the previous day (Friday), meaning they sold twice the number of pairs that were sold on Friday. We know that 14 pairs were sold on Friday, so we can calculate how many pairs were sold on Saturday as follows: 2 * 14 = 28. Therefore, the answer is: 28.\n\nHint 3: How many pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Sunday? Condition 3 states that sales on Sunday are half the quantity of sales made on Saturday. Since we determined that 28 pairs were sold on Saturday, we can figure out how many pairs were sold on Sunday by halving the Saturday sales: 28 / 2 = 14.
