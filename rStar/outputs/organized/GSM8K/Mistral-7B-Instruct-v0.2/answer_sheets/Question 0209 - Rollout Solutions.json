Since 20 dozen cups make up 240 dozens, and we know that 6 plates cost $6000, we can set up the equation: $6000 = 6 * C, where C is the cost per cup. Solving for C gives us C = $1000. Therefore, 240 dozen cups would cost 240 * $1000 = $240,000. Dividing this amount by the number of cups in 240 dozens gives us the cost per cup: $240,000 / 240 = $1000/cup. The answer is: $1000.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 21}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

First, let's find out how many cups are there in twenty dozens: 20 dozens = 20 x 12 = 240 cups. Next, we know that the cost of all these cups together is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates which costs $6000. So the cost of 240 cups is 6000 - 1200 = 4800. Finally, the cost of one cup is 4800 / 240 = $20.

We know that 20 dozens (=240) of cups cost $1200 less than the price of a plate. Since 20 dozens is equal to 240, and there are 12 cups in a dozen, we have 240 = 12 * x, where x represents the number of cups in a dozen. Thus, x = 20, and there are 20 cups in a dozen. Now we have 12 * 20 * (price of one cup) = $1200 less than $6000. Subtracting 12 * 20 * ($6 - price of one cup), we obtain price of one cup = $5.71 (rounded to the nearest cent).
