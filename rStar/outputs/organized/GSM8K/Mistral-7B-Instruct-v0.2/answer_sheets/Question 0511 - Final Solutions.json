Gerald earned 30 dollars a day and worked for 7 days. So he made 30 * 7 = 210 dollars. But he spent a total of 100 dollars during that week. That leaves him with 210 - 100 = 110 dollars at the end of the week. However, the question asks for how much money he spent during the week. To find that, we need to subtract what he earned from what he had at the start of the week. His earnings for the week were 210 dollars, so he spent 210 - 210 + 100 = 100 dollars during the week. However, the information about the initial amount was not given in the problem statement. It appears that there was a mistake in the problem statement. The correct answer should be based on the given condition that Gerald's expenses totaled 100 dollars, not that he had 100 dollars at the end of the week.
