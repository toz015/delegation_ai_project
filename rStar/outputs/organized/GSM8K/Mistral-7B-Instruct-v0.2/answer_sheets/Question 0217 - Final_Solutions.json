First, let's calculate Nick's earnings from Job A. He earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year, so his annual income from Job A is $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000. From Job B, Nick earns $42,000 per year.\n\nNow, let's find out the taxes for each job. For Job A, since it is located in a state that charges a 20% tax rate, Nick pays 20% of his entire income. So, his tax for Job A is 20% of $30,000 which equals $6,000.\n\nFor Job B, first we need to determine Nick's net income. This is calculated as Nick's gross income ($42,000) minus the property tax ($6,000). So his net income from Job B is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
