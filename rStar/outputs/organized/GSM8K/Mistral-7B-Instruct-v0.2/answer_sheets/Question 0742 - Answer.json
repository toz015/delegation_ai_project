{"id": 742, "problem": "In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class 40% of the students are girls. How many boys are in each class?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.\nThe girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.\nThat means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.\n#### 24", "gold_answer": "24"}
