According to the conditions, Lily collected 7 more insects than David, who collected half as many as Bodhi. Using the information provided, we can find that Lily collected 7 more than half of Bodhi's collection, meaning she collected (half of Bodhi's collection + 7). Also, we learned that Bodhi's collection was 43 in total, so we need to find his collection first. From the condition \"David collected half of Bodhi's collection\", we learn that David had x = Bodhi's insects / 2 insects. Given that Lily's collection was 7 more than David's, we have Lily's collection = x + 7. We also know that the sum of their collections equals 43. Therefore, Bodhi's insects + David's insects = 43. Solving this equation, we find that Bodhi's insects = 22, and since David's insects = x = 22/2 = 11, Lily's insects = 22 + 7 = 29.
