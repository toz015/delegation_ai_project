She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?", "ost_step": {"1": "Find the total number of basketball cards. Each deck has 25 basketball cards. There are 6 decks, so there are 6 decks * 25 basketball cards/deck = 150 basketball cards.", "2": "Find the total number of baseball cards. Each box has 40 baseball cards. There are 5 boxes, so there are 5 boxes * 40 baseball cards/box = 200 baseball cards."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards (6 decks * 25 basketball cards/deck). She also has 200 baseball cards (5 boxes * 40 baseball cards/box). The total number of cards is 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards. Since she kept 50 cards, that means 350 - 50 = 300 cards were given away. Each student received 10 cards, so there are 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students. The answer is: 30.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
