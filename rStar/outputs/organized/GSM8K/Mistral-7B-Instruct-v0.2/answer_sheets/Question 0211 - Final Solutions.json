According to hint 1, red chickens lay 15 eggs daily. From hint 2, white chickens lay 5 times the number of red chickens + 2, thus laying 5*(R+2) eggs daily. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, we have the equation: 15 + 5*(R+2) = 42. Solving this equation for R using standard algebra methods gives us R = 5. Therefore, the answer is: 5.
