Now we can find out how much money will remain in her account after 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, there are 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months in 3 years. Let's see how much money remains if Katina keeps removing 833 dollars per month for these 36 months.\n\nFirst, let me calculate the total amount of money spent during these 3 years. That would be 833 dollars/month * 12 months/year * 3 years = $28676.\n\nNow, let's subtract this from the original $3000 to find out how much money Katina will have left in her account after spending this amount. So, the answer is: $3000 - $28676 = -$1330. However, since Katina cannot have negative money, this calculation doesn't make sense.
