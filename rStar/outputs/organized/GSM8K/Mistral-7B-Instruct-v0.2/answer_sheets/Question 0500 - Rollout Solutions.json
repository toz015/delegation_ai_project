We can solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get: Lily = (2*David) + 7. Solving for David, we have 2*David = Lily - 7, and David = (Lily - 7)/2. Since Lily and the total number of insects are known, we can substitute Lily = 43 - David into the equation for David, which results in 2*(43 - David) = 43 - 7 => 2*46 = 42 => David = 42/2 => David = 21. Since the number of insects David found is not stated in the problem, but only determined through the given relationships, it doesn't make sense to state David's number explicitly.

According to the conditions, Lily collected 7 more insects than David, who collected half as many as Bodhi. Using the information provided, we can find that Lily collected 7 more than half of Bodhi's collection, meaning she collected (half of Bodhi's collection + 7). Also, we learned that Bodhi's collection was 43 in total, so we need to find his collection first. From the condition \"David collected half of Bodhi's collection\", we learn that David had x = Bodhi's insects / 2 insects. Given that Lily's collection was 7 more than David's, we have Lily's collection = x + 7. We also know that the sum of their collections equals 43. Therefore, Bodhi's insects + David's insects = 43. Solving this equation, we find that Bodhi's insects = 22, and since David's insects = x = 22/2 = 11, Lily's insects = 22 + 7 = 29. The answer is: 29.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
