So, the correct answer is 18 sheep.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Hint 1: Each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs. Hint 2: Since there are no other animals besides sheep and geese, the total number of legs (70) belongs only to the sheep. Thus, 4 legs/sheep * number of sheep = 70 => number of sheep = 70 / 4 = 17.5. However, 70 cannot be divided evenly by 4, so one sheep more exists, making it 18 sheep. Therefore, the answer is: 18.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
