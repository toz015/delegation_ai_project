Condition 1 says Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. Each friend plays mini-golf once which costs $5. Let's calculate how many friends she can accommodate with just the mini-golf cost: $90 / $5 = 18. So Morgan can accommodate 18 friends with mini-golf. The answer is: 18.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The answer to your question is: 18. This is because you mentioned that Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party, and each person participates in one round of mini-golf which costs $5. Therefore, Morgan can accommodate 18 friends with mini-golf alone. However, as per the hint, there are additional costs for arcade tokens and go-kart rides, so the actual number of friends she can invite might be different. But based on the information given about mini-golf, the answer is 18.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 20}]
