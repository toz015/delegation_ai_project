But we also know that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. To find out how much laundry David does, we divide 400 by 4 which equals 100. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we divide 400 by 2 which equals 200. This means that David does 100 pounds of laundry while Raymond does 200 pounds.
