First find out how many living units there are in the building. We know that there are 15 floors. And each floor is divided into 8 living units.

To calculate the number of unoccupied units in the building, first find out the total number of units within the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 living units, the total number of units can be found by multiplying the number of floors by the number of living units per floor, which is 15 * 8 = 120. However, since we need to find the number of unoccupied units, let's determine what fraction of these units are occupied. It is stated that three-quarters of the available units are currently occupied. Mathematically, we can express this as 3/4 or 0.75. To calculate the number of occupied units, we need to multiply the total number of units by the fraction representing the occupation rate, which yields 120 * 0.75 = 90. Since there are only two possible states for the units (occupied or unoccupied), the remaining portion after subtracting the occupied units from the total represents the unoccupied units. Hence, we compute 120 - 90 to obtain the count of unoccupied units.\n\nTo continue the calculation, 120 - 90 = 30.
