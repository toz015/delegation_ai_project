Question: What is the amount Jessica pays toward her debts annually based on her preferred overpayment strategy?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What is the monthly minimum payment for student loans?", "subanswer": {"text": "The monthly minimum payment for student loans is $300.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Based on the hint, we know Jessica's minimum payment for student loans is $300/month. Her credit card minimum payment is $200/month. And her mortgage minimum payment is $500/month. Her preferred strategy is to pay 50% more than these minimum payments. To calculate this, we'll first find her monthly overpayments. Overpayment for student loans is $300 * 1.5 = $450. Overpayment for credit cards is $200 * 1.5 = $300. Overpayment for mortgage is $500 * 1.5 = $750. Next, let's find her annual payments. Annual payment for student loans is $450 * 12 months = $5400. Annual payment for credit cards is $300 * 12 months = $3600. Annual payment for mortgage is $750 * 12 months = $9000. The answer is: The amount Jessica pays toward her debts annually based on her preferred overpayment strategy is $5400 + $360", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
