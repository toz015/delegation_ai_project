So he had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, which together make 7.\n\nNext, we need to figure out how many white fish Bob bought at the pet store so that the current number of orange and white fish meet the condition 3, stating that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. To calculate this, we know that Bob initially had 4 white fish, and he now has 8 orange fish.\n\nSince Bob currently has twice as many orange fish as white fish, he must have 2 * x white fish, where x is the number of white fish he started with. However, we don't know the value of x directly, but since we know that x was the initial number of white fish, we can use the information about the initial number of white fish and orange fish (Condition 1) to find the solution:\nx = 4 (initial number of white fish)\nThen the number of white fish Bob bought at the pet store is:\ntotal number of", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 21}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
