Since one truck can only carry 75 pounds, it would need 6000 / 75 = 80 trucks. But we believe that a single truck couldn't possibly make 80 trips, so instead of assuming that a single truck makes 80 trips, let us assume that multiple trucks transport these stones together. For example, if 4 trucks work together, then the total weight they can carry is 4 * 75 = 300 pounds, and the number of full trucks needed is 6000 / 300 = 20 trucks (with 3 flagstones each).
