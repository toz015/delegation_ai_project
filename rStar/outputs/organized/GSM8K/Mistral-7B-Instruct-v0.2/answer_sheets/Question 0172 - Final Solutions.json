Condition 3: Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. Condition 4: Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old. Question: What is the combined age of the four birds at the Caboose?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How old is Sally Two?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. From condition 2, we know Sally Two is older than Granny Red by three years. From condition 3, we know Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. And from condition 4, Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, who is 8 years old. We can set up equations to solve this system: let X be Sally Four's age. Then Granny Red's age is 2X and Sally Two's age is X+3. We also know that X=8. Substituting into the other equations gives Granny Red's age as 2*8=16. And Sally Two's age as X+3=8+3=11. The answer is: 11.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. From condition 2, we know Sally Two is older than Granny Red by three years.

To find the combined age of all the birds, we add their ages: 11 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo). The answer is: 43.", "value": 0.40625}}}, "rollout_id": 17}]
