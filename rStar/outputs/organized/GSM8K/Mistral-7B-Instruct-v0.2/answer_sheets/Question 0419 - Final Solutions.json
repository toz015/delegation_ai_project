Question: What vertical distance, in feet, should Oliver ascend to reach the location of Stanley's fallen comb?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How far is Stanley above the location of the fallen comb?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Stanley is at 10,000 feet and the fallen comb is at 6,000 feet. So the difference in their elevations is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 feet. Stanley is 4,000 feet above the location of the fallen comb. The answer is: 4000.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How far should Oliver ascend to reach the location of Stanley's fallen comb?", "subanswer": {"text": "To find out how high Oliver should ascend, we need to determine the vertical distance between Oliver's current position and the location of the fallen comb. Since the comb is located 4,000 feet above Stanley, it's also 4,000 feet above Oliver's location. Oliver needs to climb up that distance to reach the fallen comb. The answer is: 4,000 feet.", "value": 0.65625}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 20}]
