So Sophia brought home 1/4 * 12 = 3 onions.\n\nAccording to condition 2, the number of potatoes Sophia brought home is also one fourth of the number of potatoes Rose brought home. Rose brought home 4 potatoes. So Sophia brought home 1/4 * 4 = 1 potato.\n\nTo find the total amount of vegetables (onions + potatoes) Sophia brought home, we can add the numbers of onions and potatoes she bought. Sophia brought home 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items.\n\nThe total weight or volume of these items depends on their individual weights or volumes. Given no such information, it is impossible to determine the exact total amount. However, we know that Sophia brought home a total of 4 items consisting of 3 onions and 1 potato. The answer is: Sophia brought home 3 onions and 1 potato.

From condition 2, the number of onions and potatoes that Rose purchased is four times what Sophia purchased. Given that Rose purchased 12 onions, we can determine the number of onions Sophia bought by dividing the number of onions Rose bought by 4: 12 / 4 = 3 onions.
