According to the conditions, there are customers removed for reasons other than not wearing masks or shoplifting. We need to find out how many. First, let's understand the relationship between mask-refusers and shoplifters. From condition 2, we learn that shoplifters are 4 times the number of mask-refusers. Let's call the number of mask-refusers N. Thus, X, the number of shoplifters, equals 4N. From condition 3, we also know that 3 times the number of shoplifters are removed. That means there are 3X removed. Substituting X with 4N, we get 3 * 4N = 12N. At this point, we cannot determine a specific value for N without knowing more information, but we can conclude that the number of customers removed for reasons other than masks or shoplifting equals 12N.\n\nTherefore, since the answer must be a single number, the answer cannot be definitively determined based on the provided information alone.
