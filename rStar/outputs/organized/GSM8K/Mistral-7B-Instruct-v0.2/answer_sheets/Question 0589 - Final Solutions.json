Since we're asking for the difference in final weights, let's find out what his initial weight was if he gained 1.75 pounds per week eating donuts. Let's call this initial weight W. After 5 weeks of eating donuts, W becomes W + 5 * 1.75 = W + 8.75 pounds. The difference in their final weights is W + 8.75 - (W + 6.25) = 2.5 pounds. The answer is: 2.5 pounds.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 18}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Following the same logic as hint 1, according to condition 2, Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week when eating donuts.

The answer is: +1.75.\n\nHint 3: Calculate the difference in Martin's final weights after 5 weeks based on his breakfast choices. Over 5 weeks, the difference in weekly weight changes due to his breakfast choice would be (-1.25) x 5 (for Cheerios) and (+1.75) x 5 (for donuts). Using the formula difference = first number - second number: Difference = (-1.25) x 5 - (+1.75) x 5. Multiplying and subtracting: Difference = -6.25 - (+6.75), which simplifies to Difference = -11.
