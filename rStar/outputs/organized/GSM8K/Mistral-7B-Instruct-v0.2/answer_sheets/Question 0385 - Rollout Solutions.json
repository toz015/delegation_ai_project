First, we know that half (or 50%) of the choir are girls and half are boys. That means 50% * 52 = 26 girls and 26 boys, for a total of 52. During the performance, only girls showed up and half of them couldn't come due to the bus issue. That leaves 26 girls / 2 = 13 girls. With the 3 teachers, there are now 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people. We started with 52 members, so the initial size of the choir was 52. The answer is: 52.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Subtract the number of people who performed during the show from the initial number of choir members to find out how many members couldn't come due to the bus issue or who didn't participate at all. The difference is 52 (initial size of choir) - 16 (number of people who participated) = 36. Since each non-participating member was either a girl who couldn't come due to the bus issue or one of the 26 boys, there must have been 36 girls or boys who didn't participate. However, since only girls were allowed to sing in the performance, all 36 of these missing members must have been girls.", "2": "Determine how many girls there were originally.
