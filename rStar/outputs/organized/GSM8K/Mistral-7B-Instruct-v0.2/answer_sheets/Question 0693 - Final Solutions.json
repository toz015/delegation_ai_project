From condition 3, there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. From condition 4, there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. And from condition 5, there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Let's assume the number of squares of one color is X, Y, and Z for red, blue, and green respectively. We know that X = Y + 4, Y = Z + 2, and Z = X + 12. We need to find X (the number of red squares). Using the first equation, X = Y + 4. We can use the second equation to find Y, which equals Z+2. Substituting the third equation into this, Z+2 = Z+2+6, or Z = 14. Thus Y = Z+2 = 16, and X = Y+4 = 20. Therefore, there are 20 red squares.
