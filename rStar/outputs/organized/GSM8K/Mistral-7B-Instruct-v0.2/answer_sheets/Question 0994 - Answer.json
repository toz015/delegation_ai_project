{"id": 994, "problem": "Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.\nIgneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.\nIn total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.\nThus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
