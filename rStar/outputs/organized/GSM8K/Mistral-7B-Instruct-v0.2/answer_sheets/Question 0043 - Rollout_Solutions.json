Let's calculate the revenue earned from Thursday first. The mechanic charged $60 per truck tire, and he repaired 6 of them. That means he made 60 * 6 = 360 dollars from truck tires on Thursday. As mentioned in the hint, he made 160 dollars from car tires on Thursday. So in total on Thursday, he made 360 + 160 = 520 dollars. \n\nFor Friday, we know that he made 40 * 12 = 480 dollars from repairing car tires.\n\nSo he made 520 dollars on Thursday and 480 dollars on Friday.  520 - 480 = 40.
