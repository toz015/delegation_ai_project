Question: How long will it take Andy to complete all the restringing tasks?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How long does it take to restring one racquet with synthetic gut?", "subanswer": {"text": "It takes Andy 15 minutes to restring one racquet with synthetic gut.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How long does it take to restring one racquet with polyester strings?", "subanswer": {"text": "It takes Andy 22 minutes to restring one racquet with polyester strings.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how long it takes Andy to complete all the tasks, we first determine the number of racquets requiring each type of string. We know that three racquets require synthetic gut, five racquets require polyester string, and four racquets require a hybrid set. Therefore, the total number of racquets to be restringed is 12.\n\nSince three racquets require synthetic gut and it takes Andy 15 minutes to restring one racquet with synthetic gut, it takes him 15 minutes * 3 = 45 minutes to complete the restringing for those three racquets.\n\nSimilarly, since five racquets require polyester strings and it takes Andy 22 minutes to restring one racquet with polyester strings, it takes him 22 minutes * 5 = 110 minutes to complete the restringing for those five racquets.\n\nLastly, since four racquets require hybrid sets and it takes Andy 18 minutes to restring one racquet with a hybrid set, it takes him 18 minutes * 4 = 72 minutes to complete the restringing for those four racquets.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 17}]
