Let's assume the Collie bed needs x pounds of stuffing. We know that 2 < x < 8.\n\nLet's calculate how many pounds of stuffing are required to make 3 Collie beds: 3 * x.

This amounts to 4 beds * 2 pounds = 8 pounds of stuffing. The answer is: 8.\n\nHint 4: We need to make 3 collie beds. Since the collie bed is larger than the chihuahua bed but smaller than the Rottweiler bed, we can estimate its size as being midway between those two values. Let's assume each collie bed takes 5.5 pounds of stuffing (which lies between 2 and 8). Thus, 3 collie beds would take 3 * 5.5 = 16.5 pounds of stuffing.

One collie bed uses an amount of stuffing that lies between the Rottweiler and chihuahua bed sizes. Since the Rottweiler bed uses 8 pounds of stuffing and the chihuahua bed uses 2 pounds, the collie bed must use a quantity of stuffing lying between these two amounts. Let's assume this value is 6 pounds for now (we'll refine this later). Therefore, 3 collie beds would require 3 * 6 = 18 pounds of stuffing.
