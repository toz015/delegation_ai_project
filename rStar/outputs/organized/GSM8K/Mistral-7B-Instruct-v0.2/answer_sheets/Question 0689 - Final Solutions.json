Manolo spent a total of $3.20 on both lollipops and candies.

For finding the cost of candies, since the cost of lollipops is already known, the total cost of 10 lollipops and the same number of candies is $3.20. Subtracting the cost of lollipops, $4, from the total cost will reveal the cost of candies: $3.20 - $4 = -$0.80. Since this value is negative, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. As it stands, this question cannot be answered. If the error is corrected, the answer would depend on the cost of one candy ($1.20/(number\\_of\\_candies)).
