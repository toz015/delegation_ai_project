According to condition 1, Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. Since condition 2 states Marissa makes 3/4th the amount Ruiz makes in half the time, then Marissa makes 120 / 2 * 3/4 = 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour. Since they both work for 12 hours a day, Ruiz makes 12 hours/day * 120 pounds/2 hours = 720 pounds of chocolates per day.
