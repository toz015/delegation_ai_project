Mishka also bought 3 pairs of pants so to calculate their price, we need to subtract this total from the total sum that was spent (the problem doesn't tell us the total amount but since the question only asks about one pair of pants, let's assume that Mishka spent the difference between the initial sum and the price of 1 pair of pants): Let's say the total amount is T.
