If he gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and gains 15 new pairs on Wednesday and 30 pairs on Friday, how many shoes will he have on Sunday if he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.\nWhen he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.\nSince a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.\nThe total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300\nOn Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120\n#### 120", "gold_answer": "120"}
