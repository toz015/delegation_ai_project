Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, making a total of 10 * 20 = <<10*20=200>>200 cows. Mr. Sylas adds 40 cows, which increases the number of cows per stall by 2. So, each stall now holds 22 cows (originally 20 + 2 new cows). To find out how many cows are housed within eight of the stalls, we simply multiply the number of stalls by the current number of cows per stall: 8 * 22 = <<8*22=176>>176.
