So, let's assume Anne has fewer books than Fawn instead. This would mean Anne = Fawn - 12 and Sofie = Fawn + 25. Solving this system of equations, we find that Fawn has 39 books.

Substituting x with Fawn's number of books minus 12 (from condition 3), we get: Fawn's books = x + 12. Now, substituting x with the value calculated from the equation x + y = 85, we get: Fawn's books = (85 - y) + 12.
