After buying a package, and placing post-it notes on 220 coffee cups, she had 23 left. To find how many post-it notes were in the package that she purchased, let's first determine how many she had in total before buying anything, which includes the ones she put on the coffee cups. Since she ended up with 23 post it notes after using 220, we can write an equation: (initials)+(package)+(used)=final. From this, we know (initials) equals 80, (used) equals 220. To solve for (package), the equation becomes 80+(package)+220=23. Solving for (package) we get package=-317. Since you cannot purchase a negative number of items, Candice must have lost count somewhere. But that's another problem altogether. Since you cannot have a negative number of items, the initial value of (used) must be higher than 220 since it is actually 80+used=23, then used should be 57 (which is not possible) or lower. With the total being 23, the number of Post its Candice bought must be higher than 220 otherwise she wouldn't have been able to reach 23 at all. In addition to what she started with, she also bought a large quantity of post it notes. Thus our new equation looks like 80+(x)-300=23. Solving for (x) yields the correct number of post it notes that Candice bought. First subtract 300 from both sides, getting -220+(x)=23, and then add 220 to both sides to isolate (x), resulting in (x)=243. Therefore Candice bought 243 post it notes.

Initially, Candice had 80 post it notes. When she got home, she still had 23. This means that the number of post it notes she bought at the store (denoted as x) plus the 220 post it notes she used at work minus the 80 post it notes she initially had equals 23. This leads us to an equation: x + 220 - 80 = 23. Simplifying the equation, we obtain: x + 40 = 23. Subtracting 40 from both sides, we get x = 23 - 40 = -17. However, the answer should be positive because you cannot purchase negative post-it notes. It seems like the initial setup of the problem is wrong. In fact, it says that after putting the 220 post-it notes on the coffee cups, she still had 23 post-it notes. This indicates that when she left work, she still had 80 + x post it notes. But she also used 220 post it notes. Since she ended up with 23 post it notes, we need to include these in our count. We could try using (x + 80) + 220 = some value > 80. However, this will not give us the correct answer either. The trick here is that we need to figure out the final count after she has used 220 post-it notes, not before. The equation becomes (80 + x) + 220 = some number greater than or equal to 80, but it is actually incorrect. After using 220 post it notes, she has x + 80 left over. Since 23 post it notes remain, we should write the following equation: x + 80 = some number > 80. To find this some number, we need to add 220 to what remains. In other words, we need to calculate (x + 80) + 220 = some number > 80. However, this doesn\u2019t help because it still doesn\u2019t solve our problem since we do not know \u201csome number\u201d and we are solving for x.
