Let's calculate the cost for 1 friend first: 5 (mini-golf) + 5 (arcade) + 10*2 (go-karts) = 20 dollars. So Morgan needs 20 dollars per friend.

Morgan wants to pay for one round of mini-golf per person (which costs $5). Since she wants to have enough for herself and her friends, she needs to buy $5 worth of tokens for each friend, too. Let's say she has 'n' friends. That means she needs $5*2 per friend, or $10 per group of friends. So she needs to pay this amount for each of her n groups of friends. Thus, she spends 10*n dollars on arcade tokens. We know she has a budget of 90, so we can set up the equation 10n=90 and solve it for n. Solving the equation, we find out that n equals 9, meaning Morgan has 9 friends. Therefore, the total amount of money she needs for arcade tokens is 10n = 10*9 = 90.
