We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 180 = 5A + Smallest Angle, and since A = Angle between any two non-adjacent angles, we know that Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180, so we have Angle C = 180 - Angle A - Angle B = 180 - 2A - 3A = 180 - 5A.

In this case, if Angle C is the largest angle and Angle A and Angle B are the other two angles, then the interior angle formula states that Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees.

Based on Conditions 1 and 2, Angle A and Angle B make up 2 * Smallest Angle + 3 * Smallest Angle = 5 * Smallest Angle = 5x degrees, while Angle C makes up the remaining 180 - 5x degrees. Substituting this into the condition that the sum of all interior angles equals 180 degrees yields: 5x + (180-5x) = 180. Solving this equation, we find that x = 12 degrees, which means the smallest angle is 12 degrees. Therefore, Angle A is 2 * 12 = 24 degrees and Angle B is 3 * 12 = 36 degrees. Thus, Angle C is 180 - 24 - 36 = 120 degrees. The answer is: Angle C = 120 degrees.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "However, the answer provided earlier was incorrect. Apologies for that mistake. In fact, since Angle A = 2 * Smallest Angle and Angle B = 3 * Smallest Angle, it follows that Angle A and Angle B each contain more degrees than Angle C. Specifically, since the smallest angle is 30 degrees, Angle A and Angle B each contain 2 * 30 = 60 degrees and 3 * 30 = 90 degrees, respectively. Since the sum of all interior angles is equal to 180 degrees, it follows that Angle C must be equal to 180 - 60 - 90 = 30 degrees.
