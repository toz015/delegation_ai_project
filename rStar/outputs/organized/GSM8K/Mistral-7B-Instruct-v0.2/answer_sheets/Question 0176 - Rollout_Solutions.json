Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. How many cups of flour will Carla need to bake the cookies today and tomorrow?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine how many cups of flour are required to make a dozen cookies. The problem states two cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first determine how many cups are needed to make a dozen cookies: Since 2 cups of flour can make a dozen cookies, it means 1 dozen / 12 = 1 cookie requires approximately 2/12 = 1/6 cup of flour. Therefore, to make 36 cookies, Carla would need 36 * (1/6) = 6 cups of flour. To make 30 cookies, she would need 30 * (1/6) = 5 cups of flour. Thus, Carla would need a total of 6 + 5 = 11 cups of flour. The answer is: 11.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
