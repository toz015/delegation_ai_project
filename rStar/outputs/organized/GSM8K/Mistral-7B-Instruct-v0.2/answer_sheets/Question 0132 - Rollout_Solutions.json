Without this information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer to the question.\n\nHowever, if you have additional information about how many blue and red pen bags Janet purchased, you can use that information to calculate the total number of pens she now owns.\n\nFor example, if Janet bought x blue pen bags and y red pen bags, then:\nTotal number of pens = 9x + 6y\n\nSo the answer depends on how many blue and red pen bags Janet purchased.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.

Initially, Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, making a total of 32 pens. She then bought 6 bags of blue pens, and there were 9 pens in each bag.
