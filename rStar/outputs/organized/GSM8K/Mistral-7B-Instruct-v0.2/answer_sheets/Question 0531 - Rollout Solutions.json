However, we made a mistake when calculating passengers entering on the second stop. Let me correct this: The passengers entering on the second stop should be 21 * 3 = 63. So the passengers remaining after the second stop would be 48 - 21 + 63 = 104. This seems impossible since we started with 48 people. It seems like there might be an error in the problem statement.
