The answer depends on how many hours she works per day. Let's assume she works for eight hours: $8.00 x 8 = $64.00. If she works for ten hours: $8.00 x 10 = $80.00. Let's go with the higher option for now.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First we need to figure out how much money Lori needs to save up in order to buy the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so her total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.\nNow we have to determine how long she has to work in order to make enough money for this purchase. Since she makes $80.00 per day, we can divide her total savings goal by her daily earnings to find out how many days it would take to save up for the items: $352.00 / $80.00 \u2248 4.40 days.\nTo convert this approximate value into whole workdays, we need to round up since she cannot work a fraction of a day: 4 full workdays plus some portion of a fifth workday. Since the portion is less than a full day, it won't change our answer when rounded up. Therefore, she needs to work for approximately 5 days to afford these items.
