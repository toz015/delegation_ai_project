Together, they travel 160 miles. Therefore, each train traveled half of that distance, which is 160 / 2 = 80 miles. On the second day, they move in opposite directions, so we need to find out the distance one train traveled and double it to get the combined total. The combined total is 150 miles. To find out the distance one train traveled, we divide 150 by 2, which equals 75. The combined distance on the first day was 80 * 2 = 160 miles, and the combined distance on the second day was 150 miles.
