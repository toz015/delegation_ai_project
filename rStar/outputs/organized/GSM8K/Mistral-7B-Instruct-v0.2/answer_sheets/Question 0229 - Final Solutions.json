Condition 2 states that 30% of these became ripe, which means 120 * 0.3 = 36 watermelons were harvested. This leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons unripe initially. Condition 3 states that 3/4 of those remaining were harvested. This means 84 * 0.75 = 63 watermelons were harvested. Therefore, 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons remained unharvested.
