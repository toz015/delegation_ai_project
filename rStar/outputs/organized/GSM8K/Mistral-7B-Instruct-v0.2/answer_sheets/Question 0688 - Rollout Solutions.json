John has 3 hours until dinner time. We need to convert it into minutes, since all other tasks are measured in minutes. 3 hours equals 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. John also has 20 minutes for history homework. He also has 20 minutes for math homework and 40 minutes for reading homework. Therefore, John's total homework time is 20 + 20 + 40 = 80 minutes. Since John has 180 minutes until dinner, the difference tells us how long John can nap: 180 - 80 = 100 minutes. The answer is: 100.", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
