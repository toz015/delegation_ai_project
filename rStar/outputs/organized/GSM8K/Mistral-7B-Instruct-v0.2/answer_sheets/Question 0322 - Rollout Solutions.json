Jam has 3 boxes of pencils, and each box holds 5 pencils. So Jam has 3*5=15 pencils in boxes. Also she has 2 extra pencils. So together Jam has 15+2=17 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils, so together they need 17(from jam)+46(from meg)=63 pencils worth of storage space. Since each box holds 5 pencils, they will need 63/5=12.6 boxes. However since we can't have a fraction of a box, they will need to get 13 boxes to store all their pencils. The answer is: 13.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
