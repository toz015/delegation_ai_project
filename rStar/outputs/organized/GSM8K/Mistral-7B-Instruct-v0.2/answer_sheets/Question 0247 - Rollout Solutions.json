Isabelle paid $12 for cake ingredients, $43 for birthday presents, $15 for decorations, $4 for invitations, and $22 for goodie bags. That makes a total of 12+43+15+4+22 = 86 dollars. Since she split this evenly among 3 people, each person paid 86/3 = 28.67. However, it would not make sense for someone to owe a fraction of a dollar, so we can assume there was an error in the problem statement and each person actually paid 86/3 = 28.67$ rounded up to 29 dollars. The answer is: 29.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
