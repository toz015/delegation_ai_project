Monica needs to wrap gifts for her family, friends, and teachers. She knows how many gifts she needs to wrap for her friends (4) and for her teachers (2). She also knows how many inches of ribbon are available (144), and how many inches are needed for one bow (unknown). Let's call the number of gifts for her family 'x'. Since she needs to wrap x gifts for her family, she will make x bows, and use x inches of ribbon. Since she has 144 inches of ribbon, we know that x = 144 / inches_per_bow.
