Condition 1 states that Bobby has 3 times as many video games as Brian, with 5 fewer.

To find out Bobby's video game count, we first determine how many games Brian has now and then use the relation between their amounts. We found that Brian currently has 15 video games. Since he has \u2154 of Bobby's games, we need to find a value for B that satisfies this condition. Let's try 20 since it's close to what Brian initially had. With this assumption, we have \u2154B = 15. Multiplying both sides by \u2154, we get B = 20 / (\u2154) * \u2154B = 15 * \u2154 / \u2154.
