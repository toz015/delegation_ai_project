If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Uncle Ben has 4 horses. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats twice a day, so each horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats daily. Uncle Ben needs 10 pounds of oats for each horse daily, so he needs 4 * 10 = 40 pounds of oats for all horses daily. Uncle Ben needs this amount for 5 days, so he needs 5 * 40 = 200 pounds of oats. One bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so he needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats. The answer is: 4.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
