According to condition 1, Henry baked twice as many cookies this year as last year. And according to condition 2, he ended up with 110 cookies. We want to know how many cookies Henry made last year. Let's call the number of cookies he made last year 'x'. According to condition 1, he made 2x cookies this year. But according to condition 2, he ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we need to solve the equation 2x = 110. By dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 55.
