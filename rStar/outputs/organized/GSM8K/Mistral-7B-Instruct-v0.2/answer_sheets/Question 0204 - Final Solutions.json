Let's first find out how many pens Janet bought for blue and red. The number of blue pen bags was 6, and each had 9 pens. That makes 6 x 9 = 54 blue pens. Similarly, she bought 2 bags of red pens, each having 6 pens. That makes 2 x 6 = 12 red pens. Next, we can subtract these pens from Janet's initial stock of pens to see how many green pens she had: 22 (green) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red) > 22. The difference tells us how many green pens she initially had. Let's calculate it: 22 + 54 + 12 = 88. However, we started with 22 green pens. Thus, we must have made an error in our calculations.

We don't have any information about how many blue or red pen bags Janet bought, so let's call the number of blue pen bags 'b' and the number of red pen bags 'r'. Using this information, we can calculate the new total number of pens that Janet has as follows:\n\nTotal number of pens = Initial number of pens + Number of pens in blue pen bags + Number of pens in red pen bags\n= 32 pens + 9 pens per blue bag * Number of blue pen bags + 6 pens per red bag * Number of red pen bags\n\nWe don't have enough information to determine the exact values of b and r, but whatever their values are, this equation tells us the total number of pens Janet now has.
