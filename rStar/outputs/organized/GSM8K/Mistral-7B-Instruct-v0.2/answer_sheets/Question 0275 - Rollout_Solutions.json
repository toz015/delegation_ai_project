Cole spent all of his savings on both pairs of jeans. We know that he spent $6 less on the jogger jeans compared to the tattered jeans. Let x represent the cost of the tattered jeans. So the cost of the jogger jeans is x - $6. Cole also saved 1/3 of the difference between these prices, meaning 1/3(x - (x - $6)) = $6. By simplifying this equation, we get 1/3($6) = $2, so x - (x - $6) = 2 * 3 = 6. Solving the equation, we find that x = $12. The difference between the costs of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is therefore $12 - ($12 - $6) = $12 - $6 = $6. The answer is: 6.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
