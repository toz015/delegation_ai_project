First we need to find out how many minutes it takes Toby to read the whole book. He reads one page in 1 minute and 20 seconds or 1.33 minutes, so it takes him 45 pages * 1.33 minutes = 60.65 minutes or about 61 minutes to read the entire book. Since the condition says Toby needs to be at the airport within 60 minutes, it looks like he has just enough time to finish the book without having to leave too early. However, we also have to account for the travel time to the airport which is stated as taking 10 minutes. Therefore, in order to arrive at the airport exactly on time, Toby should start reading when he still has about 50 minutes until departure time. With a reading speed of 1.33 minutes per page, this means he should start reading at the 45th page around the 34.23 minute mark. To know exactly when he should start reading, we can calculate how many pages he can read in the remaining time: 60 minutes (departure time) - 50 minutes (reading until then", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 20}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long.
