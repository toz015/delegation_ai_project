From condition 2, we know that the number of students needing size small shirts is twice the number needing size extra-small. Let's call the number of students needing size extra-small 'x'. Then, there are 2x students needing size small shirts. According to condition 3, there are 4 fewer students needing size medium shirts than those needing size small. Let's denote the number of students needing size medium shirts as 'y'. This means that y = 2x - 4. Following condition 4, half as many students need size large shirts as those needing size medium. Thus, the number of students needing size large shirts is y/2. Lastly, according to condition 5, six more students need size extra-large shirts than those needing size large. This can be written as x+1 = (y/2)+6. We can solve this system of equations for x. Unfortunately, it requires some algebra and might not result in a simple solution.

We know that condition 2 states the number of students needing size small shirts is twice the number needing size extra-small. Given that 11 students need size extra-small shirts, it follows that 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small shirts. Condition 3 tells us that four fewer students need size medium shirts than those requiring size small, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium shirts. According to condition 4, half as many students need size large shirts as those needing size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large shirts. Condition 5 indicates that six more students need size extra-large shirts than those needing size large, meaning 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large shirts. To get the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we add up all the shirts needed for each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 65.
