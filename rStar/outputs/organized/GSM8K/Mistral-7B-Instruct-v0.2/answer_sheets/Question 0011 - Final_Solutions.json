Therefore, if half of what was left at the orange house is among those sales, then the number of vacuums she started with would be half of the rest, plus all that was sold up to now, including selling a third at the green house (which would give us 2) and selling 2 at the red house. In other words, she had 5, plus the remainder at the orange house, plus the 2 at the green house, plus the 2 at the red house, which is 5 + 1(orange) + 2(green) + 2(red). That gives us a total of 10. However, since we know that she sold 2 at the green house, we need to add back those 2 and subtract 1 from the remainder at the orange house because 1(orange) will give us 7 instead of 5. This tells us that Melanie actually sold half of 8 at the orange house. Now we can go back and say that she sold a third of something to get 2 at the green house. We also know that 8 minus half of it equals 5. Half of 8 would equal 4. And therefore the original amount of vacuum cleaners would be 8 / 3 * 3 = 8. However, 2 were also sold at the red house. Melanie started with 8 + 2 = 10. The answer is 10. However, this solution involves too many steps and might not be correct. Another way to look at this problem is to realize that Melanie had an unknown number of vacuum cleaners that she initially owned and that when she sold the first set, she lost an equal portion, or in other words, she had 2 times X vacuum cleaners. She then sells another 2, leaving her with half of the 2X. At this point, Melanie has sold 2 * X + 2 vacuum cleaners. Now, Melanie is left with X vacuum cleaners. We know that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. Therefore, we can write the equation 2X - X = 5 or equivalently X = 5.

Let's assume Melanie had Y vacuum cleaners. From condition 2, we know that Melanie sold Y / 3 vacuum cleaners at the green house. That means Melanie had (Y - Y/3) vacuum cleaners left.
