First, find the size of Zack's locker. Since it's half the size of Timothy's locker, and we don't know Timothy's locker size, let's assign Timothy's locker size as 'x'. So Zack's locker is x/2 cubic inches.\nNow Peter's locker is one-quarter the size of Zack's locker, so Peter's locker is (x/2)/4 or x/8 cubic inches. Given the condition 3, Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. We can set up an equation: x/8 = 5. Solving for 'x', we get x = 40. Therefore, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, which violates the condition 1 as 5 is not one-quarter of 20.
