Condition 2 says that the delivery truck weighs 3755 pounds when empty plus the weight of its driver. We want to find out how much the driver adds to this weight. This means we need to know what the truck weighs without the driver. The answer isn't directly available so we can ignore it for now. Let's assume the number of boxes on the truck is 'x'. According to Condition 3, the weight of these boxes will be 15x. By Condition 2, the weight of the truck with boxes but without the driver is 3755 + 15x. By Condition 1, the maximum weight of the truck (including boxes and driver) cannot exceed 5000 pounds. Thus, the equation representing the situation is 3755 + 15x + d <= 5000 where 'd' represents the weight of the driver. Simplify the inequality: 15x + d <= 1245. Rearrange this equation to isolate d: d <= 1245 - 15x. To proceed further, we'll need another piece of information, which is missing in the problem statement.

First, let's calculate how much weight the boxes can add: Each box is 15 pounds, so if we let 'x' represent the number of boxes, then 15x represents their combined weight. So far, the equation looks like this: Truck's weight = 3755 pounds + Driver's weight (let's say this is y) + 15x pounds (combined weight of the boxes). This equation is equal to or less than the bridge's maximum capacity of 5000 pounds.
