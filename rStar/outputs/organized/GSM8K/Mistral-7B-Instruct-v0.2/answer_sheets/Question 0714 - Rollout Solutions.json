He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.  How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the cost of picking 30 pounds of blueberries. This cost is $1.5 per pound multiplied by 30 pounds. So, it costs 1.5 * 30 = $45 to pick 30 pounds of blueberries."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. It cost $20 just to get to the blueberry farm. Each pound cost $1.5, so 30 pounds cost 1.5 * 30 = $45. The difference in price between what James paid and what he would have paid buying at the store is 45 - (30 * 2.5) = $45 - $75 = -$30.\n\nBut since we cannot have negative savings, we can say instead that James spent $30 less than if he had bought all those blueberries at the store.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
