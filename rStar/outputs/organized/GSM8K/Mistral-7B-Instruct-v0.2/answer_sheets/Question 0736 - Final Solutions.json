Boris initially had 100 apples. Beck had 23 fewer apples, so Beck had 100 - 23 = 77 apples. Boris gave Beck 10 apples, so now Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples. Beck's new apple count is 77 + 10 = 87 apples. The difference is 90 (Boris's current amount) - 87 (Beck's current amount) = 3. Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.
