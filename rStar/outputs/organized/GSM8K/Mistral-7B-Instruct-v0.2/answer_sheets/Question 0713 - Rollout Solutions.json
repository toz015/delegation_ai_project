To find out how many tiles this is, we need to divide by the tiles per square foot: 2/3 * L^2 / 24 = (L^2)/(144). Since we don't know the actual size of the bathroom, we can't provide a specific number of tiles as an answer, but rather this formula: The answer is: L^2/(144) or (Bathroom Area)/144.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "The answer is L^2/(144) or (36 sq ft)/144 = 0.25 sq ft / tile. This means that approximately 25 square feet of bathroom will require 1 tile. To get the exact number of tiles needed, you must determine the dimensions of your bathroom and input those values into the formula.", "2": "Since Mr Boarden wants to cover two-thirds of his bathroom, we multiply 36 sq ft by 2/3 to find out how much floor area he wants to cover in tiles: 36 sq ft * 2/3 = 24 sq ft."}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
