First, let's figure out how much mileage Sophia gets per gallon since we know she drove 100 miles on 4 gallons. Mileage per gallon is 100 / 4 = 25.

This comes out to 12 gallons, which means she can drive the entire 300 miles without needing another refill because her tank holds exactly that amount. However, since we need the distance as the final answer and not the number of gallons, we consider what was asked. The problem asks us about total miles she can drive before needing another refill.
