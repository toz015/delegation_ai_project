Since we know that the dinner cost is less than 120 dollars because Ali still had some money left, let's try the largest possible dinner expense less than 120 dollars: 115 dollars. This would mean 3/5 (160 - x) = 115, which leads to the equation 160 - x = (5/3)*115 => x = 160 - (5/3)*115 => x = 160 - 172.42 => x = 11.58 not possible since money is not divided into cents, so we should lower our dinner expense estimate. Let's try 110 dollars instead: 3/5 (160 - x) = 110 => 160 - x = (5/3)*110 => x = 160 - (5/3)*110 => x = 14.29. In this case, Ali gave her sister 14.29 dollars and has 145.71 dollars left.

We don't have enough information to find the exact value of x, but we do know that it satisfies the condition x + 120 <= 160. By trying different possible values for x, we find that when x = 11.58, we get a valid solution. However, since money is not divided into cents, this solution is not realistic. Using the second solution, we find that x = 14.29 results in a valid solution. Thus, the remaining money is 145.71 dollars. The answer is 145.71 (using trial and error, but impractical).

First we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. She has 4 $10 bills which equals 4 * 10 = 40 dollars. She also has 6 $20 bills which equals 6 * 20 = 120 dollars. So she has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars in total. Next, we need to figure out how much she spends on dinner. She spends 3/5 of her remaining money. Let x be the amount of money she gave to her sister. So the remaining money is 160 - x. She spends 3/5 of this on dinner, so 3/5 (160 - x) = dinner expense. We don't know how much she spent on dinner, but we can determine how much money she gave to her sister if we assume certain values for dinner expenses.
