To find out how much water Hannah needs, we first calculate how many calories she burned during both workouts. Hannah spent 2 hours on aerobics, which burnt 1000 calories.

Since 100 ml of water is needed for every 200 calories burned, Hannah would need (1600 / 200) x 100 ml = 8000 ml or 8 liters of water.
