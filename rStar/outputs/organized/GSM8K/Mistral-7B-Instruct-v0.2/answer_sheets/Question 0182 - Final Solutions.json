Let's find out Mark's age using condition 2: Two years ago, Mark's age was five more than half of Jan's current age (which is 30). So we can write this as: (1/2) * 30 + 5 = Mark's age two years ago. Solving this equation, we get 15. Since Mark's age was five less two years ago, his current age is 15 + 5 = 20. Therefore, Jean's age is 20 + 2 = 22.
