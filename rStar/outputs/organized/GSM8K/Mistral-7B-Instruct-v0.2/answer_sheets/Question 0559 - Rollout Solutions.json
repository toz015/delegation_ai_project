Octavia drinks half the recommended daily cups, so she drinks 1 cup (half of 2). Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 x 1 = 10 cups. However, since he needs to reduce this to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, we need to find out how much 10 cups is and subtract the difference to reach the goal. Since Octavia drinks 1 cup and the daily recommendation is 4 cups, the difference is 4 - 1 = 3 cups. Juan currently drinks 10 cups, so the difference he needs to make up is 10 - 4 = 6 cups. To get to 4 cups, he can then reduce his consumption by 6 cups per day. The answer is: 4 (the new daily recommended amount) + 6 (the reduction Juan must make) = 10.
