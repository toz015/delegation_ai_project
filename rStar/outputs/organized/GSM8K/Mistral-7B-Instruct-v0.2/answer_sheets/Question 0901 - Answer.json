{"id": 901, "problem": "Calvin is making soup for his family for dinner. He has a pot with enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Four adult bowls equal eight children\u2019s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children\u2019s bowls.\nCalvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children\u2019s bowls.\nThus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children\u2019s bowls at dinner.\nAfter dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children\u2019s bowls left over.\nThere are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.\n#### 1", "gold_answer": "1"}
