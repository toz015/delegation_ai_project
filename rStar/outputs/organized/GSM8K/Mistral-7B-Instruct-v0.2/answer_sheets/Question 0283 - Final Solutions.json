And a single sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch. Next, we know Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones for each necklace. However, the finished necklace must be exactly 25 inches long. We can find out how many beads are needed by calculating the difference between the length of the finished necklace (25 inches) and the sum of the lengths of all the topaz gemstones used in the necklace. Since there are 8 topaz gemstones, we can calculate it as follows: 25 inches - (8 topaz gemstones * 1 inch each) = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.
