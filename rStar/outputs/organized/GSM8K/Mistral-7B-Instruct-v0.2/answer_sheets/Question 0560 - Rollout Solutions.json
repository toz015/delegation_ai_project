Altogether, there are 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents. But the question asks for the number of rodents in the cages containing guinea pigs only. Since there are 3 such cages, that would be 3 * 15 = 45 / 2 = 22.5. However, it's not possible to have half a rodent, so the question seems to be incorrectly stated or the information provided might be missing something important.
