First we need to figure out how many times the second friend rang the bell. We know the second friend rang the bell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means 1/4 * 20 is 5. So the second friend rang the bell 20 + 5 = 25 times. Next, we already know that the third friend ran the bell 70 times because it is 10 times more than 60. So now we can add up all the numbers together. 20 (first), 25 (second), 70 (third) ,and 60 (fourth). 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 is 175.
