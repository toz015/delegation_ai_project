Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, we subtract the number of eggs that fit on the trays from the total number of eggs. We know Jaime has 64 eggs, so the difference between this number and the product of the number of trays (which is 2, since 24 goes into 64 twice) and the capacity of each tray (24) will tell us how many eggs won't fit.\n\nCalculation: 64 (total eggs) - (2 trays * 24 eggs/tray) = 64 - 48 = 16 eggs\n\nSo, 16 eggs will not fit on the trays.
