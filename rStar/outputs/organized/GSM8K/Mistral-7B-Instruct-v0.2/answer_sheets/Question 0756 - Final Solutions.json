The answer is 11.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many council members voted in favor of the new regulation?", "subanswer": {"text": "There were 11 council members who voted against the new regulation, and since the number of votes in favor is double the number of votes against it, 2 * 11 = 22 council members voted for it.
