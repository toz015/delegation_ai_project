We know that Billy spent $5 on gumballs, so he spent all of it except for the change. Let x be the weight of the candy Billy bought. Billy spent $1.5 per pound on the candy, so he spent $1.5x. We also know that Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each one cost him $0.05. So Billy bought 40 gumballs, and their price was $0.05 each. That means Billy spent 40 * $0.05 = $2 on gumballs. The cost of the candy was $1.5x, and the cost of the gumballs was $2. Setting these costs as equal, we get $1.5x = $2 + $5. Solving this equation, we find that x = (2 + 5) / 1.5 = 5 pounds. The answer is: 5 pounds.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
