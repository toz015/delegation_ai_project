We know that the herd contains 180 heads. Each camel has 2 humps, so there are 180 / 2 = 90 camels. Dromedaries only have 1 hump, so we need to find out how many dromedaries are here based on their 1 hump. Let's call the number of dromedaries 'x'. Thus, the total number of humps in the herd is equal to (number_of_camels * number_of_humps_per_camel) +(number_of_dromedaries * number_of_humps_per_dromedary).

Since each camel has two humps and there are 180 heads, there are 180 / 2 = 90 camels. However, we also know that there are 304 bumps, which correspond to the number of camels (as each camel has 2 humps and there is 1 bump per hump). This means that there are 304 camels instead.
