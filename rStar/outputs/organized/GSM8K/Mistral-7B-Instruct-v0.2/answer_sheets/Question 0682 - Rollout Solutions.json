Let the extended length be represented as x + 0.5x.\n\nCondition 2 states that an additional 20 cm (or 0.2 m) is added to the bottom. Therefore, we can write the total length of the dress as x + 0.5x + 0.2.\n\nFrom the question, it is stated that the final length of the dress is 140 cm or 1.4 m. Setting up the equation and solving for x:\n\nx + 0.5x + 0.2 = 1.4\n1.5x + 0.2 = 1.4\n1.5x = 1.2\nx = 0.8\n\nSo, the original length of the dress was 0.8 meters or 80 centimeters.

If the original length of the dress is represented as 'x', then the extension length is 0.5 * x = 0.5x. The new length would then be x + 0.5x + 20, which simplifies to x + 0.5x + 20 = 1.5x + 20. Solving for x, we get x = (20)/(0.5) = 40. Adding this value to the original length gives us a final length of 40 + 40 = 80 cm.

Since the extension added was equal to 50% of the original length, we can find the original length by dividing the new length by 1.5: x = 80 / 1.5 = 53.33 cm. However, since the lengths must be given in whole numbers, we can assume that Shania rounded down the final length to the nearest whole number.
