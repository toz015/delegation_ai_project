We know there are 4 schools, so there are a total of 10 players/school \u00d7 4 schools = 40 student participants (not including coaches). Additionally, since each school sends a separate coach for each team, and there are 2 teams per school, this means there are 4 schools \u00d7 2 coaches/school = 8 coaches in total.

First, calculate the total number of students from both teams in one school. There are 2 teams per school, so we multiply the 5 players in one team by 2 (2 teams).
