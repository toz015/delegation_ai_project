However, you also asked how much weight the driver adds to the truck's empty weight. I'm going to address both parts of your request. First, let me tell you about the driver's weight. You said the driver weighed 245 pounds. As such, the weight of the truck before the boxes are loaded onto it would be 3755 + 245 = 4000 pounds. Now, let's figure out how many boxes the truck can load to stay under the 5000 pound weight limit. We could simply divide 1000 (the amount over the weight limit) by 15 (the weight per box). 1000 / 15 is approximately 66.66667.
