Let x = Sam's age. Then Ruby's age is 6x. We can set up an equation based on the given information that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This results in the equation 6x+9=3(2x+3). Solving for x yields x = 1.5. However, ages cannot be fractions, so let's assume x=1 (which makes Ruby 6), and adjust the result accordingly. With x=1, Ruby's age is 6, and Sam's age would then be 1. So Sam's age is 1, making Ruby 6 times older, as stated. The answer is 1 for Sam's age.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so in 9 years, Sam will be Ruby's 1/3 age. Let's call Sam's age in 9 years 'x'. Now we can write two equations: Ruby's age = 6*Sam's age; Sam's age + 9 = x/3. Solving these equations, we find that Sam's age is currently 1/6th of Ruby's age. So, Ruby's age is 6*(1/6)*9 = 9.
