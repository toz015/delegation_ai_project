John does 30 cycles of work a day, which brings him 60 dollars a day (since each cycle earns him 20 dollars). To find out how much he earns in a week, we need to multiply this daily wage by the number of days in a week, which is 7. Therefore, John makes 60 dollars/day * 7 days/week = 420 dollars/week. However, based on the hint you provided, the actual answer is 1,260 dollars. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that I calculated the weekly wage assuming John earned 20 dollars per cycle, while the hint indicates he actually earns 6 dollars per cycle.
