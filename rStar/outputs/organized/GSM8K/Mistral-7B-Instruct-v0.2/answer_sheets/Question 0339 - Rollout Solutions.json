Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Each cow has 4 legs. So cows have 20 x 4 = 80 legs. Farmer Brown also has 40 chickens. Each chicken has 2 legs. So chickens have 40 x 2 = 80 legs.

But we're told that there are 60 animals equally divided between chickens and cows. We know there are 30 chickens, so there must be 30 chickens for 60 legs and 30 cows for 60 legs.
