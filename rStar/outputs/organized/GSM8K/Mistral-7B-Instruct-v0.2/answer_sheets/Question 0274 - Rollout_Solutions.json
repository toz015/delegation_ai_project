First, we calculate the amount Bill paid for the first 6 months at the reduced rate. That's 6 months times $8 per month, which equals $48. Next, we need to find out how long Bill pays $12 per month. We know this occurs for 8 months, so the total he pays for these months is $12/month times 8 months = $96. Finally, we figure out how much Bill paid for the last 12 months, which starts after the 6 initial months and ends at the price increase to $14 a month. This amounts to 12 months at $14/month, or $168. However, we already calculated $48 in the reduced pricing period.
