When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors per day, and made 100 * 10 = 1000 dollars. Now, they sell 5 silos per day, and make 220 * 5 = 1100 dollars. They make 1100 - 1000 = 100 dollars more per day. 100 is 10% of 1000. The answer is: 10%.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos.

They sell 5 silos a day at $220 per silo. So the daily revenue from selling silos = 5 * $220 = $1100.\n\nNow, we can find the percentage increase. First, let's calculate the difference between the daily revenue from selling silos and the daily revenue from selling tractors: $1100 - $1000 = $100. Next, calculate the percentage increase: ($100 / $1000) * 100%. The answer is: 10%.", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
