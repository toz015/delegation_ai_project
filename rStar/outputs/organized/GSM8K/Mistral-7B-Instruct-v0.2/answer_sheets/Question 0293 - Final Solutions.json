From condition 1, we know that Mike gets 21 points, Jim gets 19 points, and Tony gets 2 times as many points as Mike, which is 2 * 21 = 42 points. The answer is: 42.\nHint 4: How many points do each player receive as extras? Since each player gets an extra point for having over 20 points, Mike, Jim, and Tony will all receive 1 extra point each because they all have over 20 points after the first three rounds (Mike: 21+, Jim: 19+, Tony: 42+).\nHint 5: How many total points does each player have? Let's think step by step. Mike has 21 points in the first three rounds and an additional 1 extra point, making it 22 points. Jim has 19 points in the first three rounds and an additional 1 extra point, making it 20 points.
