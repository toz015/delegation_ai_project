He swims 3 miles, so it takes him 3 times longer: 3 * 48 = 144 minutes. In cold water, it takes him 16 minutes per mile, so it would take him 3 miles / 1 mile = 3 * 16 = 48 minutes. The difference between these times is: 144 - 48 = 96 minutes. The answer is 96.", "value": 0.65625}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
