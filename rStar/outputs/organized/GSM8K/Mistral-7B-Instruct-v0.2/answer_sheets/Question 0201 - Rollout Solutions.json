That's given as 2,000 dollars per week. Next, since there are 52 weeks in a year, multiply John's weekly salary by 52 to get his annual salary before receiving the award. Finally, add the one-time monetary award of $5,000 to his annual salary to find his total earnings for the year. So, John starts with a weekly salary of $2,000. Multiplying this by 52 weeks in a year results in an annual salary of $104,000. Adding the $5,000 award brings his total earnings for the year to $104,500.
