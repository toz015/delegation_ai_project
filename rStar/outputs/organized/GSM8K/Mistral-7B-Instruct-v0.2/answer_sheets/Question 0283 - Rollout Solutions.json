Hint 1 tells us that the necklace is 8 inches long due to the topaz gemstones. Hint 2 states that the necklace must be 25 inches long when completed.

Given that the length of each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch, we can calculate the number of beads required to fill the remaining 17 inches. Since 1 inch is equivalent to 4 quarter-inch beads, we know that 17 inches corresponds to 17 inches / (1 inch / 4) = 68 quarter-inch beads.
