According to the first condition, 4 minutes ago, the small pool held X gallons and the big pool held 2X gallons.

Its current volume is X + 4 = 1/4 * Y => X = 1/4 * Y - 4.\nFrom the second condition, we know that the ratio of the volumes of the big and small pools is 4:1. Let's call the current volume of the big pool V. We know that 4V is the volume of the big pool now and X is the volume of the small pool now. So, 4V = (1/4)Y. Solving this equation for Y, we get Y = 16V. Substituting this into our expression for X, we find X = 1/4*(16V) - 4 = 4V - 4.

Let X be the volume of the small pool originally. At time t-4 minutes, the small pool had X and the big pool had 2X.
