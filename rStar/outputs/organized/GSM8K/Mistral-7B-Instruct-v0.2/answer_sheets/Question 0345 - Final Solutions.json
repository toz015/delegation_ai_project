The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs, so those tables have 40 x 4 = 160 legs. They also have 50 tables with 3 legs, so those tables have 50 x 3 = 150 legs. Together, the restaurants has 160 + 150 = 310 legs. Since there are 90 tables in total (40 + 50), we can find out how many legs one table with 4 legs has by dividing the total number of legs by the number of tables: 310 / 90. The answer is: 3.44.
