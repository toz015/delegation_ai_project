Since the initial total amount was 1200, the remaining amount after Dylan's investment was 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars. Frances put 720 * (2/3) = 480 dollars into the account as well. However, we already counted that 480 dollars when calculating Dylan's investment! This mistake leads to an incorrect calculation. To get Skyler's contribution, we need to find out how much the three investors put in together and subtract what we already know about Dylan and Frances. The total investment is 480 (Dylan) + 480 (Frances) = 960 dollars. Since the initial total was 1200, Skyler contributed 1200 - 960 = 240 dollars.
