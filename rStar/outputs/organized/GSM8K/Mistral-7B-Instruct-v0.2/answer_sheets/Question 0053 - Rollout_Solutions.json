To find out how long he watches and reads each day we first need to calculate how long he reads in a single session. Since he watches 2 hours, he will read for half that amount. So, he reads for 1 hour in each session. We can then calculate the time Jim spends on watching television and reading in one day. It takes him 2 hours to watch TV and 1 hour to read, which totals 2 + 1 = 3 hours in a day for these activities. Next, let's figure out how many days he performs these actions. As indicated by condition 2, he does this 3 times a week, which means he does this activity three days a week. Finally, since this pattern occurs weekly over 4 consecutive weeks (as stated in condition 3), we need to determine how many days he performed these activities in a month. Multiply the amount of days he performed the activities in a week by the number of weeks: 4 weeks * 3 days/week = 12 days.
