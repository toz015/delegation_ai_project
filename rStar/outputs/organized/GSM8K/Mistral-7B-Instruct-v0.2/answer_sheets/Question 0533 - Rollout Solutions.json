Since there are 2 monitors, and the total cost is $2,400, we can find their price by dividing the total cost by 3 because there are three items (computer, printer, and 2 monitors) and subtracting the price of the computer and printer. So 2,400 - 1,100 - 700 = 600 / 2 = 300. Therefore, each monitor costs 300.

Errol spent 2400 dollars on a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer. Let the cost of a monitor be M. Since there were 2 monitors, the cost of both monitors was 2M. The total cost of all items was 2400 = ComputerCost + 2M + PrinterCost. We know that the printer cost 400 less than the computer. So PrinterCost = ComputerCost - 400. Substituting this into our equation we get 2400 = ComputerCost + 2M + ComputerCost - 400 => 3ComputerCost + 2M = 2800 => M = (2800 - 3ComputerCost)/2.
