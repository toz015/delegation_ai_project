Each plant takes up its own space (12 inches) and the space for the next one (1.5 feet). We can convert these imperial measurements to decimal feet by dividing by 12: 12 inches -> 1 foot -> 1 foot / 12 inches -> 0.0833 feet; 1.5 feet -> 1.5 feet / 12 inches -> 0.125 feet. The total space required for one plant including itself and the next one is the sum of these two distances: 0.0833 ft + 0.125 ft = 0.2086 ft. Since Pat plans to fit 1 plant per this distance, 1 ft = 12 inches, the number of plants fitting within 111 ft is 111 ft / 0.2086 ft/plant = 531.7.
