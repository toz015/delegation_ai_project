The answer is 100%. However, since the increase in earnings is not proportional to the initial earnings, a more accurate answer would be to compare the ratio of new daily earnings to the old daily earnings: 1100 / 1000 = 1.1 or a 10% increase in earnings per tractor, but overall, a 100% increase in daily earnings when considering both products.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
