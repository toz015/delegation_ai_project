Kassidy has less money than Rayna by 60 dollars. Let's call the amount of money Kassidy has 'x'. So Rayna has 'x+60' dollars. Kassidy has 3/4 the amount of money Aurelia has, so we can say 'x=3/4*a', where 'a' is the amount of money Aurelia has. We want to find Rayna's money, so let's solve for 'x+60' in terms of 'a': x = 3/4*a - 60. Since 'a' is unknown, I cannot provide you with an exact answer.

Accordingly, Kassidy has $168.33. The second hint provided a way to calculate Rayna's money, but it required determining Aurelia's money. Unfortunately, without knowing Aurelia's money, we cannot directly compute Rayna's. However, using the information available, we can conclude that Rayna has $168.33 more than Kassidy, which is equal to $332.67. Alternatively, since Kassidy had $168.33 and Rayna had $332.67, they could have shared their money equally and had a combined total of $491.00. The answer is: Rayna has $168.33 more than Kassidy or $332.67, or they could share $491.00 equally.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
