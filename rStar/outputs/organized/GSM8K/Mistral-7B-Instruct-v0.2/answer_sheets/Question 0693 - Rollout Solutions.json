Let's call the number of red squares R, the number of blue squares B, and the number of green squares G. From condition 2, we know that R = 14. Condition 3 states that B = R + 4, and from condition 4 we get G = B + 6. Finally, from condition 5, W = G - 12. Since all squares are one foot by one foot, the area of a single square is 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area is Area = R + B + G + W. Substituting our expressions for R, B, G, and W yields Area = 14 + (14+4) + (14+4+6) + (14+4+6-12). Simplifying this expression leads us to Area = 14 + 18 + 22 + 10 = 78 square feet.
