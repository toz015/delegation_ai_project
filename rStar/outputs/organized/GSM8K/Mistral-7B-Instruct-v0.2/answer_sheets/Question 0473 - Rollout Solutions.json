What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "ost_step": {"1": "Convert the length of the remoras into one measurement. Since the length of the shark and the length of the remoras are given in different units, first convert the length of the remoras to feet. We know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, each remora is 6 inches long, making it 6 inches / 12 inches per foot = 0.5 feet long."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long. The combined length of the remoras would be 0.5 feet + 0.5 feet = 1 foot. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the combined length of the remoras in inches is 1 foot x 12 inches/foot = 12 inches. Now we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length the remoras take up. We divide the length of the remoras (12 inches) by the length of the shark (10 feet or 120 inches), then multiply by 100%: 12 inches / 120 inches x 100%. We simplify this fraction by canceling out inches (12 inches / 12 inches), which leaves us with 1/10 or 0.1. Finally, we multiply by 100% to get 10%.
