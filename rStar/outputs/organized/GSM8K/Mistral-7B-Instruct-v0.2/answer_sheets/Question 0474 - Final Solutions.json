We know that 20 students don't own a desktop computer, so the number of students who do have one is X - 20. Since 3/4 of the students have desktops, we have X = (NumberOfDesktopOwningStudents + 20) / 3/4. Solving for X, we get X = (3/4)^(-1) x (NumberOfDesktopOwningStudents + 20). Substituting this expression into the equation X - 20 = NumberOfDesktopOwningStudents, we have (3/4)^(-1) x (NumberOfDesktopOwningStudents + 20) - 20 = NumberOfDesktopOwningStudents.

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, so there are 3/4 * X students with desktops. We also know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer.

Substituting the value of Non-Desktop Students given, we get X = (3/4 * Desktop Students) + 20. Solving for Desktop Students, we get Desktop Students = (4/3)X - 20. Now let's find the number of students without a desktop computer. By definition, these students don't have a desktop, so their count is simply the total number of students minus those who do: Non-Desktop Students = X - Desktop Students.
