Thus the lowest level has an area of 128. \n\nNow, to get the total area of the top three levels, we sum their respective areas which are 16, 32, and 64: 16 + 32 + 64 = 112 square feet. The fourth level has an area of 128. Adding this to our running sum yields a grand total of 112 + 128 = 240 square feet. \n\nMean is defined as the total divided by the number of items in consideration, hence, 240 / 4 = 60.
