Question: How many more bags of flour than bottles of milk must Mark buy to make his quadruple batch of brownies?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many cups of flour are required for the quadruple batch of brownies?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Each batch of brownies calls for 3 cups of flour. So, a quadruple batch needs 3 cups/batch * 4 batches = 12 cups of flour. Since each bag contains 2 cups, the number of bags Mark needs can be calculated as 12 cups / 2 cups/bag = 6. The answer is: 6 bags or 12 cups.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Therefore, Mark needs 6 more bags of flour than bottles of milk since he requires 12 cups (or 6 bags) of flour for his quadruple batch and assumes each bottle holds 2 cups of milk.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
