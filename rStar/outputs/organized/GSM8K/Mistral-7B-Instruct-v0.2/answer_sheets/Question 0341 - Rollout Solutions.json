From the given information, we also know that the pink frog is 10 pounds lighter than the yellow snake (Z). This can be written as X = Z - 10. Also, the pink frog is 20 pounds heavier than the red bird (W). This can be written as X = W + 20.\n\nSince we already know X = 50, we can substitute this value into both equations and solve for the other unknowns:\n\n1. X = Z - 10 => 50 = Z - 10\nSolving for Z, we get Z = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.\n\n2. X = W + 20 => 50 = W + 20\nSolving for W, we get W = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.\n\nSo, we have determined that the blue beetle, green toad, and pink frog each weigh", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 18}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird.
