This means that at 1:00 PM, the candle has already burned for 0 hours. At 5:00 PM, it would have melted for 5 hours. To find out the total distance the flame moved during these 5 hours, we need to multiply the speed (which is 2 cm/hour) by the time, which results in 2*5=10cm. Therefore, the height of the candle will decrease by 10cm once it stops burning at 5:00 PM. The answer is: 10. (This was corrected because in this response I made a mistake in interpreting your hint. When the candle is finished melting, the height will be 0.) \n\nSince we are looking for the difference in height, let\u2019s assume the original height of the candle was h.
