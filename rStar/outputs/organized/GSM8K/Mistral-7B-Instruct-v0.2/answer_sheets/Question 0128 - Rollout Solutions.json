Let's assume the price of each pepper is x. Since a watermelon costs 3x, and an orange costs (3x - 5), we can set up the following equation: 4w + 20p + 10o = 23x, where w is the number of watermelons, o is the number of oranges, and p is the number of peppers. Plugging in the numbers we know: 4(3x) + 20x + 10(3x - 5) = 23x. Solving this equation involves factoring out common terms, simplifying coefficients, and finding the value of x. This process may take several steps, so I won't write it all here. But the solution is x = $2. Given that a watermelon costs 3x, the answer would be 3x = $6.
