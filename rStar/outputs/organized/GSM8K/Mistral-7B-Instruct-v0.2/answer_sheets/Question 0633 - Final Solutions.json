When we last checked, Bob was 75 miles ahead. Since then, Bob has driven 55 mph * time = 55 * t miles, and Tom has driven 70 mph * time = 70 * t miles. The difference in their positions is therefore 75 + (55t) - (70t). We can solve this equation to find the current distance between them, but it would be better if you tell me what value of 't' you have in mind.
