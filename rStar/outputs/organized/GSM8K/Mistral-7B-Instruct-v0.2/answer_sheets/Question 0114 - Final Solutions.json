Condition 1 states that 6 times more photographs can fit on Jamal's phone than Brittany's phone. Let's represent the number of photographs on Brittany's phone as 'x'. Thus, the number of photographs on Jamal's phone would be '6x'. Condition 3 states that the maximum capacity of Brittany's phone for photographs is 50 times greater than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. So, we know that 50 * Number of Ducks = x. From the given information, Jamal's phone holds 1800 photographs. Therefore, 6x = 1800. Solving this equation, x = 300. Now, using the second equation, 50 * Number of Ducks = 300, which results in Number of Ducks = 300 / 50 = 6.
