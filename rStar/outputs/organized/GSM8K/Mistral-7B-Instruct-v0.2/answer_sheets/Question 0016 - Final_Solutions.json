We need to calculate how much water we have in the remaining 24 liters after spilling 1 liter of orange drink. There are two parts to this problem: the orange drink and the pineapple drink.

That means 20/3 is the amount of water in the orange drink. Then we take into account that 1 liter was spilled. Spilled 1 liter is equal to (20-20*3)/3 = -10/3. Add this to 20/3 to get (20-10) / 3 = 10/3. Then we also have the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of the 15 liters of pineapple drink is 45/5 which equals 9 liters. Now let's add these together.

We already know that 6.67 liters of water was in the original orange drink. Next, let's consider the pineapple drink. It contains three fifths water, and its volume is 15 liters. To find out how much water there is, we need to calculate three fifths of 15 liters, which can be written as 15 * (3 / 5). This calculation simplifies to 45 / 5 or 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink. \n\nSince we've determined that 6.67 liters of water were in the orange drink initially, and 9 liters of water were in the pineapple drink, the total amount of water initially would be 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. When 1 liter of the orange drink spilled, the entire liter of water from the orange drink also got spilled. Thus, the amount of water remaining in the solution is 15.67 - 1 = 14.67.

That means the orange drink contains approximately 6.67 liters of water. Next, find out the amount of water in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink contains 3/5 water. 15 liters * 3/5 = 15 * (3/5) = (15*3)/5 = 45/5 = 9. Therefore, the pineapple drink contains 9 liters of water. As a result, the initial total amount of water is approximately 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters. Given that 1 liter was spilled, subtract the spilled liter from the initial amount of water.
