Each year he plants 10 new trees while cutting down 2 old trees. That means each year he gains 10 trees but loses 2 trees, so his tree count increases by 8 per year. After 10 years, his tree count is 50 + 10*8 = 100 trees. But then, 30% of those trees die, which means 100 * 0.3 = 30 trees die. So Tom has 100 - 30 = 70 trees remaining.

Tom starts with 50 trees, but loses 2 every year, so after 10 years he would have 50 - 10x2 = 20 trees. The remaining trees after 10 years die off and 30% of them are 20x0.3=6 trees. So Tom needs to plant enough new trees to have initially 50+6 = 56 trees. Since Tom plants 10 trees per year, it takes him 56/10 = 5.6 years to reach this number. Since we can't plant half a tree, it means Tom needs to plant 6 extra trees during this period to compensate for the lost trees and the dying ones. As such, Tom plants (10+6)/year = 16 trees every year.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many trees does Tom have left?", "subanswer": {"text": "Tom plants 16 trees every year, and chops down 2 trees every year.
