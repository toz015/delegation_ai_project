He started out with 2 cases of water which have 24 bottles each. He has 70 guests that will be arriving, and he wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. How many additional bottles of water will he need to buy?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's calculate this step by step: Bill currently has 2 cases of water which contain 24 bottles each, so he has 2 * 24 = 48 bottles already. Each of his 70 guests is going to require 2 bottles of water, meaning he'll need to provide 70 * 2 = 140 bottles in total. To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the amount of bottles he already has from the total amount of bottles required: 140 - 48 = 92. Therefore, the answer is: 92.", "value": 0.78125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
