The cost of one petunia is $3, so Katherine must pay 15 * $3 = $45 for petunias. Since she also needs to buy sweet potato vines, let's calculate the number of them next. In each basket, she puts 2 sweet potato vines, so for all 5 baskets she needs 2 sweet potato vines * 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines. The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50, so she must pay 10 * $2.5 = $25 for sweet potato vines. To find the total cost, we just need to sum up the costs for petunias and sweet potato vines: $45 (petunias) + $25 (sweet potato vines) = $70.
