One fourth of the total amount (which is 1000) is 250 pieces. That leaves us with 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.\n\nNext, we'll calculate what fraction of those remaining pieces Poppy's mom placed. It states that she placed a third of the remaining pieces. We know that a third can be expressed as 1/3. To multiply this by 750, we need a common denominator, which would be 3. \n\nNow that both numbers share the same denominator, we can proceed with multiplying them together! This becomes (1/3) \u00d7 750 = 250 pieces.\n\nLastly, all that remains is subtracting 250 from 750 to get our solution. 750 minus 250 equals... 500!\n\nThe answer is: 500.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 26}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.
