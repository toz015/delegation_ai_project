Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.\nHelene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.\nThe total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.\nWilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
