When doing this division, we get 29 / 2 = 14.5. Since we cannot divide a whole number by a fraction, we need to round up the result to the nearest integer, which means there should be 15 groups of 2 bottles, and 1 group of 1 bottle remaining.

Let me explain it step by step. First, let's figure out how many bottles the teacher gave to each student. The problem says the teacher gave \"each student 2 bottles\", but the actual number of students (29) doesn't evenly divide into 2 (because 29 / 2 = 14.5). That means some students must receive an extra bottle. In fact, 15 students will get 2 bottles, while the last student gets 1 bottle. Therefore, the teacher distributed 15 * 2 + 1 = 31 bottles. But the problem statement mentions that the teacher had 900 bottles initially, which is incorrect, as we calculated above. The correct initial amount would be 900 * 100 / 100 = 900 bottles.

With 9 coupons, the teacher can get 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles of apple juice for free.

Since the teacher starts with 9 coupons, she can get 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles. But she already gave away 58 bottles. So she retains 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 895 bottles. However, since the problem asks for the number of bottles the teacher retains for herself, not the number of bottles she still owns in total, we subtract the bottles she gave away (58) from the original number of bottles she owned (900), giving us 842 bottles. But this result does not fit with our initial calculation of 900 bottles. We made a mistake in the second calculation, so let's go back and correct it.

However, because the actual number of bottles exchanged from the coupons would be greater (due to some bottles being partial), it may not exactly match the expected number of bottles based on the coupon exchange rate. To account for this difference, you should add the difference between the actual and expected number of bottles to your final answer.
