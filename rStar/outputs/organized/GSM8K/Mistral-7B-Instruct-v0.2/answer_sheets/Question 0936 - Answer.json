{"id": 936, "problem": "A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.\nIf Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.\nThis means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.\nAltogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.\nTherefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.\n#### 250", "gold_answer": "250"}
