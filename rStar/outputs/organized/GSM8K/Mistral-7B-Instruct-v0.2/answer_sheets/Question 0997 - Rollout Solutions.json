Walter collected $500 from his neighbors, so the amount from the online fund is unknown. We know Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as Walter himself collected. Let x be the amount he collected from the neighbors and the online fund. From what we know, x = 500 (neighbors) + y (online fund). We also know Walter's lawyer donated $200 extra. Three times what Walter collected equals x + 200. Therefore, 3x = x + 200 => 2x = 200 => x = 100. So he collected 100 from the neighbors. That means he collected 100 + 500 = 600 from both sources.
