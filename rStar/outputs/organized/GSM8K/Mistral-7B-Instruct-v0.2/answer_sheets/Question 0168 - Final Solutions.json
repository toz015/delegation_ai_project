From condition 1, we know that Jimmy has $2 more than double what Ethel has. That means Jimmy has 2 * (amount of Ethel's money) + 2. And from condition 2, we know that Ethel has $8. We can set up this equation: Jimmy's Money = 2 * Ethel's Money + 2, Ethel's Money = 8. Let's solve for Ethel's Money: Subtracting 2 from both sides of Jimmy's Money equation, we get: Jimmy's Money - 2 = 2 * Ethel's Money. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: Jimmy's Money / 2 = Ethel's Money. Since Jimmy's Money is 2 * Ethel's Money + 2 according to the problem statement, it follows that Ethel's Money = (Jimmy's Money / 2) - 1. Plugging in Ethel's Money from this equation into our initial equation: 2 * (Jimmy's Money / 2", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The answer is: 11.\nExplanation:\nSubstituting Ethel's Money = (Jimmy's Money / 2) - 1 from the previous calculation into Jimmy's Money = 2 * Ethel's Money + 2, we get: Jimmy's Money = 2 * ((Jimmy's Money / 2) - 1) + 2. Solving for Jimmy's Money using algebra: 2 * ((Jimmy's Money / 2) - 1) + 2 = Jimmy's Money => (Jimmy's Money / 2) - 1 = (Jimmy's Money - 2) / 2 => Jimmy's Money - 2 = 2 * ((Jimmy's Money - 2) / 2) => Jimmy's Money - 2 = Jimmy's Money / 2 - 1 => Jimmy's Money = 3 * Jimmy's Money / 2 + 2 => 2 * Jimmy's Money = 6 => Jimmy's Money = 3.
