The second venue costs $25 per person for the venue and another $5 per person for food. The total cost at the second venue is 25 dollars per person for the venue and 5 dollars per person for the food. That makes it 25 + 5 = 30 dollars per person overall. To find when the total cost at the first and second venue is the same, we set the cost at the first venue equal to the cost at the second venue. 200 = 30x. Solving this equation x = 200/30 = 6.67. Since you can't have a fraction of a guest, we round up to the nearest whole number, and try 7. Let's check if 7 guests works. At the first venue, the cost is fixed at 200$, while at the second venue, the cost is 25$ per person + 5$ per person for food = 30$. With 7 guests the cost is 7 * 30 = 210$.
