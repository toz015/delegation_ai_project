Since there are 3 cleanings in a single lesson, and the entire process takes 2 minutes, we can calculate the time spent on each cleaning by multiplying the number of cleanings by the length of a single cleaning in minutes, and then dividing by the total number of minutes in an hour. Time spent on one cleaning = 3 * 2 / 60 = 1/10 hour or 6 minutes. So, a single lesson takes 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes. With this information, we can now calculate the number of minutes spent on cleanings in a day by multiplying the number of cleanings per day by the length of a single cleaning.
