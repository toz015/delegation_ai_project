Initially, there were piles of equal size. One pile had letters needing stamps (with 60 letters) and the other pile had already-stamped letters. We know there are currently 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. So at the beginning, there were also 60 - 30 = 30 letters in the pile of unstamped letters. When Jennie finished stamping, both piles had 60 letters. So one-third of those letters, or 60/3 = 20 letters, had received stamps during that time. Therefore, she stamped 60 - 20 = 40 letters in all. Since she worked through the entire pile once, she spent her entire time stamping just the letters that needed it. So she started with 60 letters that needed stamps, which became the pile of already-stamped letters, and she ended up having stamped exactly all of them. This means she must have spent all her working hours stamping these 60 letters. It follows that before she started, the pile of letters needing stamps (which eventually became the pile of already-", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
