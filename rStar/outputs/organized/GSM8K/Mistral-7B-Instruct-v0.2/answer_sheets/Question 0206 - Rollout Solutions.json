During the first phase (the original schedule), Michael rides 5 times a week and covers 25 km each time. So, the total distance he covers during this period is 5 rides/week * 4 weeks * 25 km/ride = 500 km.\n\nDuring the second phase, Michael rides only 2 times a week but covers 60 km each time. Therefore, the total distance he covers during this phase is 2 rides/week * 3 weeks * 60 km/ride = 120 km.\n\nSo, the total distance Michael covers throughout both schedules is 500 km (Phase 1) + 120 km (Phase 2) = 620 km.
