Since we don't have this information given in the problem statement, we cannot provide the exact answer. However, if you want an estimation, note that there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. That leaves us with 12 cars unaccounted for which could potentially be semi-automatic. To calculate the percentage, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100%. Without knowing the actual number of semi-automatic cars, we can only estimate that they make up around half (50%) of the remaining cars or about 6 cars. This would mean 16 out of 20 cars are accounted for, leaving 4 cars unaccounted for, assuming all 4 are semi-automatic. Therefore, our best guess is that approximately 20% of the cars are semi-automatic. However, please keep in mind this is an educated guess based on the provided information and the actual percentage may vary depending on the specific distribution of car types.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 6}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
