The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so it has 60 / 2 = 30 sheep. The zoo has twice as many sheep as the farm, so it has 30 * 2 = 60 sheep.\n\nAdding up the numbers of animals at both places, we get 30 cows (at the farm) + 60 cows (at the zoo) + 30 sheep (at the farm) + 60 sheep (at the zoo) = 120 animals. The answer is: 120.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
