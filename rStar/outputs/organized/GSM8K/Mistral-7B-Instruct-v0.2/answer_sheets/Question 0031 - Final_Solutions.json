However, the question asks about retaining lego sets, not money, and we don't get any information on what happens to the lego sets when John uses the money to buy video games. Given this problem, it seems like there's some missing context or assumption. But let's follow the instructions. Since the question asks for the number of lego sets retained, but we can't find out if John sold any of them using the provided data, our solution would be to assume he didn't sell any lego sets because the data doesn't support otherwise.

John starts out with 13 lego sets. Each lego set costs 15 dollars. So selling all of them nets 13 * 15 = 195 dollars.

Therefore, he actually retails 35 - 5 = 30 dollars. The question asks about lego sets and not video games or the cash. We see earlier that John sold the 13 sets for 195 dollars.

Condition 3 tells us that he spent 160 dollars buying 8 video games at 20 dollars each (because 8 x 20 = 160) and has 5 dollars leftover. So we need to find out what portion of the 195 dollars went into buying those 8 video games. Since all of it did except for the 5 dollars, and 8 video games cost 160, then the remaining 35 dollars went towards buying lego sets (which John already owned). To determine how many additional sets this would buy him, take the price per set ($15) and divide 35 by that value which equals approximately 2.3333, but because you can't buy half a set, the correct integer solution would be 0 additional sets or 13 - 0 = 13 total sets if using exact dollar amounts rather than the approximate decimal, since there was enough money earned to cover the 13 initial sets' full value. But we know 5 dollars remains so its clear he didn't spend any of the earnings on additional sets.
