Therefore, it takes her 15 minutes to read X number of pages. Thus, we can calculate X by setting up the equation: 15 minutes = X pages / 1 minute/page, which results in X = 15 * 60 / 1 = 900 pages. Since this is not the correct number of pages according to condition 2, we made an error in our assumption. In fact, it takes her 1.5 minutes to read 2 pages (Condition 3).
