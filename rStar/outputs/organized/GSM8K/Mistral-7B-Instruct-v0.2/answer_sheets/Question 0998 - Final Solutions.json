Since each person brought 15 cookies, we can find this by multiplying the number of guests (100) by the number of cookies each person brought (15): 1500 cookies.\n\nNext, we know that half of these cookies were donated to the church. To find out how many cookies were donated, we divide the total number of cookies by 2: 750 cookies.\n\nFinally, since each person at the church received 15 cookies, we can find out how many people received cookies by dividing the number of donated cookies (750) by the number of cookies each person at the church received (15): 50 people.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is 50.", "value": 0.96875}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
