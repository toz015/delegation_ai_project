The hospital sees 500 patients daily, each staying for 24 minutes or 0.4 hours.  The doctors get paid $150 per hour and the hospital charges $200 per hour.  First find the hours worked per day: 500 patients/day * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours/day.  Next compute the cost to the hospital: 200 hours/day * $150/hour = $30,000/day.  Finally compute the revenue: 200 hours/day * $200/hour = $40,000/day.  Profit equals revenue minus costs: $40,000/day - $30,000/day = $10,000/day.
