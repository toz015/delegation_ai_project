Since the cost for both roller coaster and luge rides is the same, we can focus on finding out how many tickets Pam and Fred used for the roller coaster rides only. We know that Pam used 12 tickets for her 2 roller coaster rides, and Fred used 24 tickets for his 4 roller coaster rides. Together, they used 12 (for Pam) + 24 (for Fred) = 36 tickets for the roller coaster rides. Since this is the total amount of tickets used for the roller coaster rides only, we don't need to account for the luge rides in our calculation.
