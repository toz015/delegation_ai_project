If we let 'x' be the factor that multiplies both parts of the ratio, then Darrell is represented as 7x and Allen is represented as 11x. So if we add them up, we get 7x + 11x. This equals 18x. The problem states this sum is equal to 162. So 18x = 162. To find 'x', divide both sides by 18: 18x / 18 = 162 / 18. x = 9. But the question doesn't ask us to find x; it asks us what Allen's age is ten years from now. His current age is 11x which we just found to be 99, so ten years later he'll be 99 + 10 = 109.

Then Allen's current age would be 11x because their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. Together, Darrell and Allen are 7x + 11x or 18x. Their total age is also 162. This means 18x = 162. We can solve this equation to find the value of x. Dividing both sides by 18, we get x = 162/18. Solving this gives us x = 9. Now we know that Allen's age is currently 11x, so we substitute x = 9 into 11x. This gives us Allen's current age as 11(9) = 99.
