They also paid an additional $2 off per $20 spent during this shopping trip, which amounts to $2 * (shopping amount during this trip / 20). First, we need to find out how much money the customer spent during this shopping trip, which can be calculated as the sum of their previous spending and the rewards earned, plus any extra discount. Let's denote the current spending as C. We have: $80 + $4 + $2 * (C / 20) = C. Solving for C, we get: C = $80 + $4 + $2 * (C / 20). Multiplying both sides by 20/2 to clear the fraction, we obtain 40C = $2040. Dividing both sides by 40, we find that C = $51.

First we need to know how much they spent in their last shopping trip without considering the rewards. From condition 1, it was $80.
