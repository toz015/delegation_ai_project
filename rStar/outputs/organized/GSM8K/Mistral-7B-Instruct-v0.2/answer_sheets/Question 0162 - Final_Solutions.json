Mike spends time writing letters to respond to those he receives. Each letter is 5 pages long, and Mike can write a full page in 6 minutes. Therefore, the amount of time it takes him to write one letter is 6 minutes for each page, or 6 minutes for the whole letter. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it would take half an hour, or 30 minutes, for him to write a single letter. Given that he writes back in the same length as the received letter, he would write 30 minutes worth of letters per week for each penpal, totaling 30 minutes/penpal/week. As there are 3 penpals, this amounts to 90 minutes/week spent writing letters for responses. Since an hour contains 60 minutes, this equates to 1.5 hours spent writing letters per week.
