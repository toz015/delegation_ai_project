Thomas ate 3 times as many, which is 3 x 2 = 6. John ate half as many as Thomas, so that is 6 / 2 = 3. Since Luke ate 2, we know that 6 is 3 times larger than 2. That means 1 (the size difference between Luke's portion and one third of Thomas' portion) is also the size difference between Luke's portion and John's portion.
