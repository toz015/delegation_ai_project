We don't know the price of the strawberry gum packs, but we know their cost is twice the cost of one pack of the other kind, which costs 2 dollars. Let's call the cost of a strawberry gum pack X. Then X = 2 \\* 2 = 4 dollars. With this information, we can figure out how many packs of strawberry gum she bought. Since 4 packs cost 4 \\* 2 = 8 dollars, then 2 packs of strawberry gum cost 2 \\* 4 = 8 dollars. Thus, she bought 8 dollars worth of strawberry gum divided by 4 dollars per pack = 2 packs.
