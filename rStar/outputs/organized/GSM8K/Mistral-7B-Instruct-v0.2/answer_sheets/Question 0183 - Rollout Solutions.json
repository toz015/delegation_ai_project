Let's denote the time it takes for the first runner (R1) to finish one lap as T. Since the second runner (R2) finishes 3 seconds faster, his time would be T - 3. Similarly, the third runner (R3) finishes 3 seconds faster than R2, so his time would be T - 6, and the fourth runner (R4) finishes 3 seconds faster than R3, meaning his time would be T - 9 seconds.\n\nWe know that each runner covers a distance of exactly 400 meters.
