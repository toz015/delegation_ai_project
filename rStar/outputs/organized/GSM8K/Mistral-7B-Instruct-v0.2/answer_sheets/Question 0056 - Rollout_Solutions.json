First let's calculate the number of weekdays and saturdays. A week has 7 days, and we know the number of classes per type (weekdays or saturday). So, 5 classes/day * 5 days/week = 25 classes. We also know there are 8 classes/saturday. Therefore, 8 classes/week. 25 + 8 is 33. This means Judy teaches 33 classes every week. Since every class has 15 students, and each student pays 15 dollars, the amount per class will be 15 * 15 = 225. Multiply this by 33 classes, which results in 33 * 225 = 7425.

Since she teaches 33 classes a week, she makes 225 * 33 dollars. 225 * 30 is 6750. 6750 + (225 * 3) is 6750 + 675 = 7425 dollars.

Each class generates 15 * 15 = 225 dollars. The total revenue is therefore 13 * 225 = 2925 dollars. However, considering all weekdays, it should be calculated based on condition 1 that states each weekday has 5 classes, not condition 3.

But also consider that condition 2 mentions an exception for Saturday, where there are more classes, making the actual statement about condition 3 partially incorrect. Therefore, revisiting the problem correctly: Each weekday has 5 classes, totaling 5 * 15 * 15 dollars = 1125 dollars per weekday. With 5 weekdays, that makes 5 * 1125 = 5625 dollars, plus the revenue from Saturday, which is 8 * 15 * 15 dollars = 1800 dollars. Adding those amounts together results in 5625 + 1800 = 7425 dollars.
