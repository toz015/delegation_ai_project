Since we're told that she used 220 post-it notes for work, but we already know how many from her initial pack she used (which is 80 - 23 = 57), it follows that 57 of those 220 came from her original stash.

However, we want to determine the unknown variable, which in this case would represent the amount of Post-its Candace purchased, not the amount that she used.

Candice started with 80 post-it notes. Then she bought a package with an unknown quantity of post-it notes (let's call this X). Let's add these together first to find out what she had right after buying the package. That would be 80 + X. Right after that, she used one post-it note per cup for 220 cups of coffee. So she has 80 + X - 220 post-it notes after using them all. We know this value equals 23 because we're told she has 23 left over. So we need to solve the equation 80 + X - 220 = 23. First, subtract 80 from both sides to get X - 220 = -57. Then add 220 to both sides to get X = -57 + 220. X = 163. The answer is: 163. \n\nI hope you enjoy solving math problems like me!
