Each restaurant gets 2 pounds. The total can be found by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount per restaurant: 40 x 2. The answer is: 80. However, it seems I made a mistake earlier: The actual answer should be 4.9 (or 5 if rounded up). Since we cannot divide exactly by 2 and distribute whole numbers, we will need to round up or down as necessary to make up the difference. In this case, since the difference is small compared to the total amount of carrots being distributed, we may opt to simply round up for all restaurants. Alternatively, we could distribute the extra 1 pound evenly across all restaurants, making each distribution 4.99 pounds instead. Either way works, but the first method is simpler.

So the difference, which will not be used, is 200 - 80 = 120. But this is incorrect. The actual difference would depend on whether we round up the amount of carrots given to each restaurant. If we round up for all restaurants, then each restaurant would get 4.9 or 5 pounds of carrots, and the total amount distributed would be 4.9 * 40 = 196 pounds. Subtracting this from the original 200 pounds leaves us with a difference of only 4 pounds, which is negligible compared to the total amount.
