We know that when the water is cold, Ray can swim a mile in 16 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water, we need to figure out the difference in time it takes him to swim a single mile. Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold and 34 minutes when the water is warm. The difference is 34 minutes - 16 minutes = 18 minutes.
