{"id": 751, "problem": "Gunther, the gorilla, had 48 bananas hidden under a fern branch.  When Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile.  The next day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile, but later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas.  On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas.  How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.\nArnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.\nStarting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.\nArnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.\nGunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.\n#### 43", "gold_answer": "43"}
