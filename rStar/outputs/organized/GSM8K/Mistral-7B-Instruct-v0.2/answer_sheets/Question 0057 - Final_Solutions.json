Since we cannot find the solution using the information you provided I would say there is no correct answer. However since I am forced to write something, here is my attempt to give a valid answer. Let's think step by step. We know there are 20 instructions in one recipe. A hint tells us there are 40 instructions in another recipe. Therefore we add these together: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions. The answer is: 60. \n\nHowever this solution assumes the two recipes are different as stated by the condition and also as stated by the hint, however the actual prompt states nothing about different recipes. And therefore the number of instructions could simply be 20 + 20 which equals 40 instructions. However the original prompt clearly states the two recipes being prepared by Kelian. It is possible Kelian has already read or prepared one of the recipes before, and therefore we assume that Kelian doesn't need to read the instructions again for the other recipe. Therefore the most accurate solution we can deduce based on the provided information (and additional context), is indeed that there are only 40 instructions because we don't actually know if the", "value": 0.90625}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
