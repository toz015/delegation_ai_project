Jaime works for a company that has 100 employees. Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers. But we don't know what junior programmers earn. Let's call that amount 'x'. So senior programmers earn 'x+400'. Since the total payroll is 100 employees * their respective salaries, we can write this equation: 100(x) = 100(x+400).
