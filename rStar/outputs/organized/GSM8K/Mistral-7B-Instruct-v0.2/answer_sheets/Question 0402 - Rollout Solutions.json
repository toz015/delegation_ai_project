To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we first calculate how many bags of flour he needs for his quadruple batch. 12 cups / 2 cups = 6 bags. We know nothing about how much milk is in each bottle, so we can't determine how many bottles he would need directly. Thus, we cannot compare the exact numbers of bags and bottles. However, since Mark knows that he needs more flour than milk, and that he uses a 3:1 ratio of flour to milk, this information alone may help him when buying the ingredients.
