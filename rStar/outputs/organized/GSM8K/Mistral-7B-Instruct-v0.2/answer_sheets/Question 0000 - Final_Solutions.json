However, we also notice that the problem asks us the total number of times the alarm rang throughout the day. From Condition 1, we know the alarm rings 3 times per day. The first time, it rang 4 times. Therefore, there were 4 * 3 = 12 alarms during the first ringing. The second ringing was 3 times as long as the first. Since the first ringing lasted for an unknown duration 'x', the second ringing lasted for 3x. This means it rang 3 times as often, which is 3 * 4 = 12 times. Lastly, the third ringing lasted for 1/2 of the second ringing, so it lasted for (1/2)(3x) or (3/2)x seconds. This would cause it to ring (3/2)*4 = 6 times.
