Mike wrote letters with 5 penpals. He stopped writing to 2 of them, so he writes to 3. Each letter is 5 pages long. Each page takes 6 minutes to write. Writing one page takes 6 minutes, so 5 pages take 5 x 6 = 30 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Mike can write 30 minutes worth of pages in half an hour. To find out how many pages he writes weekly per penpal, we divide the number of pages he writes in half an hour by the number of minutes in a week, then multiply by the number of penpals he still writes to. 30 minutes / (60 minutes/hour) hours/week * 3 penpals = 15 pages/penpal/week.

Each penpal sends 2 letters a week, so 2 x 5 pages long letters a week. That's 10 pages long letters a week from one person. Since it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, writing back will also take him 6 minutes per page. So, responding to one letter takes 6 minutes. It takes 6 minutes to respond for each of the 5 pages, so it takes 6 minutes/page * 5 pages = 30 minutes to respond to the whole letter. However, we are asked about the amount of letters received per week, not the time taken to respond. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day, so there are 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 minutes in a week. Since it takes 30 minutes to respond to one letter, it takes 30 minutes/letter to respond to all the pages in one letter.
