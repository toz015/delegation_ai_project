Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, so the cost was 20 x 20 = 400 dollars. She received a discount of 2 dollars, making the actual cost 400 - 2 = 398 dollars.\n\nAt the next day, Sheila bought 20 pomegranates again, but this time the price was $30 each, so the cost would be 20 x 30 = 600 dollars. With the 10% discount, however, she paid only 600 - (0.1 * 600) = 540 dollars.\n\nSo the difference in the final prices is 398 dollars (on Tuesday) and 540 dollars (on Wednesday), which equals 142 dollars.
