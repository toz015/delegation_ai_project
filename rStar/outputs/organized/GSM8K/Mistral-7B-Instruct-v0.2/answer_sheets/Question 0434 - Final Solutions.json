Let x be the number of bags of chips. Each chip costs 40 cents so x * 40 cents = the amount of money George spent on chips. We also know that x + (the amount of money George spent on candy) = 5 dollars. We don't know the amount of money George spent on candy but we know it makes up only 1% of his spending. So the amount of money George spent on chips is x * 40 cents and 99% of his spending was on chips and candy together, which means x * 40 cents + (the amount of money George spent on candy) = 5 dollars or x * 40 cents + the amount of money George spent on candy = 5 dollars. Since we don't know the exact value of the amount of money George spent on candy, we can't determine the exact number of bags of chips he bought. However, if we assume George bought only one candy bar, then the amount of money he spent on candy is 75 cents. Substituting this into our equation above, we get x * 40 cents + 75 cents =", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "x * 40 cents + 75 cents = 5 dollars\nMultiplying both sides by 1 cent to remove the cents, we get x * 40 + 75 = 500\nSubtracting 75 from both sides, we get x * 40 = 425\nDividing both sides by 40, we get x = 10.5\nSince it is impossible to buy half a bag of chips, our assumption about one candy bar being bought was wrong. Therefore, we cannot determine the number of bags of chips based on the information provided.\n\nTo find out how many candy bars George bought, we need to know the price of a single candy bar in dollars instead of cents.
