Since it's every weekday (Monday through Friday), that makes 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water.\nHowever, on weekends, he replaces 2 glasses of water with sodas. That means he drinks 4 - 2 = 2 glasses of water on each weekend day.\nSince there are 2 weekend days, that makes 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water.\nAdding both the water drunk on weekdays and weekends, we get 20 + 4 = 24 glasses of water. The answer is: 24.

To find the average amount of water John drinks on weekdays, let's take away one glass of water from the daily amount because he drinks soda on Saturday and Sunday.
