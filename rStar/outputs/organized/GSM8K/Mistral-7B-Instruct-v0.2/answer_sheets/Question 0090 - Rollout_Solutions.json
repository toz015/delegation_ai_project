Question: How many tickets were used by Pam and Fred during their carnival visit?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the number of tickets Pam used for roller coaster rides. She rode it twice so she used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Next, calculate the number of tickets Fred used for roller coaster rides. He rode it four times so he used 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.\n\nSince both Pam and Fred rode the luge twice, they used 2 * 6 = 12 tickets each for luges.\n\nFinally, add up the tickets used by both Pam and Fred. Pam used 12 for roller coaster rides and 12 for luges, which totals 24 tickets. Fred used 24 for roller coaster rides and 12 for luges, which also totals 24 tickets. Together they used 24 + 24 = 48 tickets.\n\nThe answer is: 48.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
