However, we can find out how many families are contacted in the first generation (directly contacted families) and the second generation (families contacted through the direct contacts), which would be 3 and 3*3=9 respectively.\n\nHowever, since the question asks \"In how many families does each contacted family call 3 new families?\" the problem seems to have a mistake, as the statement doesn't match the question.
