Then, her mother adds a third of those remaining pieces (750). Since 750 divided by 3 is 250, that means 250 new pieces are added by Poppy's mom. To get the final count of how many pieces are left to be placed, subtract the new pieces from the remaining pieces. 750 - 250 = 500. The answer is: 500.  Answer: There are 500 pieces left to be placed.", "value": 0.75}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
