But as hint suggests, since every player gets an extra point for having more than 20 points, we need to check who has over 20 points. Mike has 21 points, which is over 20. So he gets an extra point, making it 22 points. Jim also has 18, which is under 20, so he doesn't get any extra points. And Tony has 42 points, more than 20, so he gets another point, making it 43 points. So in fact, Mike has 22, Jim has 18, and Tony has 43 points after the extra points had been distributed.
