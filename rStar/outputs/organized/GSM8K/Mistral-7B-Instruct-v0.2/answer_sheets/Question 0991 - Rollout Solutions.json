How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The Comet orbits the Sun every 75 years. When Bill's father saw it, he was 30 years old. So the first time Bill saw it, he was older than his father by a factor of three, meaning Bill was 30 * 3 = 90 years old at that time. Since the Comet comes around every 75 years, this means the most recent passing of the Comet happened 90 - 75 = 15 years before Bill saw it. The answer is: 15 (years before Bill saw the Comet). We can't know exactly when Bill saw the Comet because we don't know when the last passage occurred relative to his birth, but we know the difference between his age at his most recent sighting and his father's age at his sighting.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 21}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

We know from condition 2 and 3 that when Bill's father saw the comet, he was 30, and the next time Bill saw it, he was three times his father's age then.

Since the interval between observations is 75 years plus 90 years, which equals to 165 years. And Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Therefore, the age of Bill during his first observation can be found by subtracting one orbit period from the sum of his age during the second observation and his father's age during the first observation. So, Bill was born 165 years ago minus one orbit period of Comet Halley. That makes him 165 - 75 = 90 years old at the first observation.
