Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points, so Yuri scored (1/2) * 68 + 10 = 54 + 10 = 64. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the known amounts from the total. 251 = 68 + 44 + 85 + Jojo. Solving for Jojo, we get 251 - 197 = Jojo. Subtracting 197 from 251, we find that Jojo scored 54 points. The answer is: 54.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
