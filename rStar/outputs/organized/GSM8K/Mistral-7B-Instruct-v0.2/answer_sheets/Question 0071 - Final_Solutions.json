Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 230 by 60, which equals 3.833333. However, since there are only two choices of length for each TV episode (hour or half an hour), this can't be the amount of TV shown on Wednesday. It seems like our assumption was wrong: it's not possible that Frankie spent exactly seven hours watching TV. Instead, let's try solving for the number of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.\n\nWe still have", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Frankie's total TV time is 7 hours or 420 minutes. This allows us to create an equation to solve for x: 420 = 120 + 90 + 120 + 30x, which simplifies to 420 = 330 + 30x. Subtracting 330 from both sides results in 90 = 30x. Dividing by 30, we find x = 3.
