Initially, some people got on. Then 5 more came in at the first stop, so there were initially some + 5. Then 7 went out and 8 came in at the second stop. So the number of passengers changed from (some + 5) to (some + 5 + 8 - 7). Solving this equation: some + 5 + 8 - 7 = some + 10. Rearranging terms: 10 = 3*some. Dividing both sides by 3: some = 3.33.
