We know that Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a 6x6 shelving system. First, let's determine how many books fill one row of the shelves. Each column in the shelving system represents a book, and there are 6 columns in each row, meaning that there are 6 books in one row. Since Wendy wants to fill her shelves to capacity, she'll need double the number of books in one row to fill two rows, which is 6 * 2 = 12 books.
