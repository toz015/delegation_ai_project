Stanley's comb was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet. It fell 4,000 feet. The elevation of Oliver is 3,000 feet. To get from Oliver's position to Stanley's comb, Oliver must climb a height equal to the difference between their initial elevations. So he climbs 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet. But we were told the answer is 3,000. This means the comb didn't fall vertically straight down; instead it landed closer to Oliver than Stanley's initial position. Without knowing the exact location of the comb, we cannot determine exactly how high Oliver needs to climb. However, we can say for sure that he doesn't need to climb all the way up to Stanley's original position (10,000 ft). Instead, he only needs to reach the ledge where the comb is located, which is at an elevation of 3,000 ft above his current position.
