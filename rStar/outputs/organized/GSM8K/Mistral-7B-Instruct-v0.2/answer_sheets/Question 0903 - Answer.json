{"id": 903, "problem": "Jo has been making face masks. She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material and 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. How much material would she need to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.\nIt takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.\nFor the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.\nFor the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.\nIn all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.\n#### 16", "gold_answer": "16"}
