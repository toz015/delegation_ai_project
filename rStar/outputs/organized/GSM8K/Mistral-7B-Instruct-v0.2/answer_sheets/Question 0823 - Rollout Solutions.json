In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Let P be the number of points Julie scored. Since Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in this game, she scored P = 14 - 4 = 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie. So she scored 10 - 6 = 4 points. Sasha's total score is 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.
