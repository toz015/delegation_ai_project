Roger normally pays 5 dollars for each pound of coffee. To find out how much he pays for a more expensive brand, we multiply the price of the normal brand by 1 + 0.2 (which is the price increase percentage). That's 5 * 1.2 = 6 dollars per pound. Since he uses one pound of coffee a day and wants enough for a week, he needs 7 pounds in total. The price of this amount is 6 dollars per pound times 7 pounds, which is 42 dollars. Subtracting what he paid for the coffee leaves 21 dollars. Since he spent that much on both the coffee and the donut, we divide it by 2 to get the cost of just the donut, which is 10.5 dollars or approximately 11 dollars because rounding isn't precise in this context.
