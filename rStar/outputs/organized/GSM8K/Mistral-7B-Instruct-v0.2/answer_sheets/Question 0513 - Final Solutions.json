However, you asked for the final answer directly and provided the hints, so I'll assume you meant that you wanted my answer to follow your hints exactly. Therefore, the answer is: 1000 (for clothes) and 1000 (for CDs). The real answer to your question, without using the hints, would be: Julie initially had 500 dollars. Spending 20% on clothes left her with 80% of her original money, or 4000 dollars. She then spent 25% of that amount on CDs, which was 1000 dollars.
