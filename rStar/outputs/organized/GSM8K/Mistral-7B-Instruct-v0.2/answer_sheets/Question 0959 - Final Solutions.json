According to condition 3, Jason carries twice as many balls as Jeffrey, who carries x balls. Therefore, Jason carries 2x balls. Condition 4 states that Jason picks up and carries 2 additional balls. Adding these together, we find that Jason carries (2x + 2) basketballs. According to condition 1, the coach brings all the basketballs used during practice. Since Jason carries this quantity, then the coach brought (2x + 2) basketballs to the practice session. The answer is: 2x+2.\n\nTo determine the exact number, we need to know how many basketballs Jeffrey carries. However, the information provided doesn't allow us to calculate the value of x.
