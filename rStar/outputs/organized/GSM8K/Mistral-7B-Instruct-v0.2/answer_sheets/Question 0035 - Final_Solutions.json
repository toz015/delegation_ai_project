Given that one serving of these chips has 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to see how many servings we can safely consume: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings. To convert servings back into grams, multiply 0.8 by the weight of one serving, 60 grams, to get the safe amount. So 0.8 * 60 is 48 grams.

To calculate this, first we know the weight of the entire package (300 grams), then we know there are 5 portions in this package, and we want to find out how much one portion weighs.

To find out how many grams we can consume to stay under our 2000 calorie limit, we need to know how many calories are in each gram of chips.

That comes down to 250 / 60 = 4.1667 calories per gram. Now that we have the calories per gram value, let's find out the remaining safe calorie allowance. Since we have already consumed 1800 calories, we subtract those from the target to see how much we have left: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Now we divide these remaining calories by the number of calories in each gram, which is 4.1667. 200 / 4.1667 = 48.
