Since he dropped 5 cookies, he ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation 2*x+15=110, and solve for x: x=50. So Henry baked 10 more cookies than he intended, not 15. Thus, Henry baked 5 additional batches compared to the previous year, with each batch containing 5 times the number of cookies from the previous year. As a result, he ended up making (5*5)*5=125 cookies in total. However, since he only mentions having 110 cookies, this seems inconsistent with the scenario presented.
