The problem states the window is 20 feet off the ground."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The beanstalk is initially 4 feet tall. To reach or exceed the height of Mark's window (which is 20 feet), the beanstalk must double its height several times. Since it doubles every day, we need to find how many days this takes. We can determine this by taking the log base 2 of the desired height (the height of the window) and subtracting the log base 2 of the initial height. Log base 2 of 20 is approximately 4.585. Subtracting the log base 2 of 4, which is 2, results in 2.585. Rounding up to the next whole number gives us the number of days needed: 5.\n\nTherefore, it will take the beanstalk 5 days to be taller than Mark's window.
