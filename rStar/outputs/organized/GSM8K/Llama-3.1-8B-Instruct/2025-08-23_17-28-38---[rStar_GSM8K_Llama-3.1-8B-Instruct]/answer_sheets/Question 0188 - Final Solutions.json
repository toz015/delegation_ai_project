The trader bought each bag for $20, but then also spent $2 transporting it, so the actual cost per bag is 20 + 2 = 22 dollars.

Let x represent how many bags they bought. Condition 2 tells us it costs $2 to move one bag. Therefore, buying x bags would cost 2x dollars to transport those bags. We don't need this right away.\n\nCondition 3 says they get a total profit of $400 when they sell them at $30 per bag. Let y represent the number of bags they could sell. Since they can only sell what they bought, y = x (in other words, y equals x). \n\nHowever, we're trying to figure out x. From condition 3, they make a total profit of $400, meaning their income, $30y, minus their costs, $20x (for purchasing) and $2x (for transporting), is equal to 400. So, $30y-$20x-$2x=400. We simplify this to: 30y-22x=400. Since y=x, we substitute in for y. So 30(x)-22(x)=400 which simplifies further down to 8x=400, or x=50.\n\nTherefore, the trader was able to sell fifty bags of wheat", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
