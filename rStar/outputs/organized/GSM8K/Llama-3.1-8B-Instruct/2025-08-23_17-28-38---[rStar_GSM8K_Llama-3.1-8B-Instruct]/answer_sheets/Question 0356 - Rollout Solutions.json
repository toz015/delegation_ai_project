At first, we don't know how much he spent yet, so let's focus on what it costs. It costs $2 per car and $1 per teddy bear. So for 6 cars, it would cost 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. For 5 teddy bears, it would cost 5 x 1 = 5 dollars. So together they would be 12 + 5 = 17 dollars. To find out how much Dean has left, we need to subtract the money that he spent (which is $17) from his original amount ($28). That would leave us with 28 - 17 = 11 dollars left.
