The value was not explicitly asked to be known. Instead of solving for the unknown variable, the correct approach should re-evaluate the statement \"During cooking and setting the table, Julia uses a total of 3 spoons.\" Julia starts with no spoons, which indicates that the 3 spoons must have come from the first or subsequent packages of spoons, since she didn't have them yet.
