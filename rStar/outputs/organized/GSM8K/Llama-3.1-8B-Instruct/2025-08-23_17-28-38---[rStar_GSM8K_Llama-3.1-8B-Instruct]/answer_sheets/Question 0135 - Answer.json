{"id": 135, "problem": "Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.  If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games\nBrian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45\nWe then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.\n#### 40", "gold_answer": "40"}
