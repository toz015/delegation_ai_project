This equals to 80- (32+24+16), because 2/5*80=32, 1/2*(80-32)=24, and 5/8*(80-32-24)=16. The result of this calculation is 80 \u2013 (32 + 24 + 16) = 8 cards that do not have the letters A, B, or C. To determine the portion of the total cards with the letter D, we need to take 100% \u2013 the sum of percentages for the letters A, B, and C, which is 100%-((40%)+50%+(62.5%)), as fractions can be converted back to percent form by dividing by one hundred.  The result is 100% \u2013 ((40%)+(50%)+(62.5%)) = 100%-152.5%, but since you can\u2019t have a negative percentage, you should assume it\u2019s an error in your previous calculations. Let\u2019s recheck our last step. In our previous step, 5/8*(80-32-24) = 16, which is correct.  Then the portion of the cards that do not have the letters A, B, and C would be 8, instead of 24. Thus, the final result will be 100%- ((40%)+(50%)+(62.5%)). Since 100% = 1 and you could divide every % by 100%, then 1-((0.4)+(0.5)+(0.625)) =1-1.525 = -0.525. Since the results of a subtraction between numbers are always real (positive, zero, or negative), the only explanation for this is the fact that there is no room for an extra 25%.
