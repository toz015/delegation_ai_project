To find the total, we should multiply the total number of dogs and cats by the sum of the number of dogs and cats to get rid of duplicates. The formula would look like: Total = 2 * (d + c). However, we don't know what value of either d or c is, so let's use what we do know instead. We know that d + c = 23. Multiplying both sides by 2 results in 2d + 2c = 46. Because there are also two cats per one dog, there are always two times as many cats as dogs, so we can write an equation 2d + 2c = 2(d+c), and we've found out earlier that d+c = 23. That makes sense because multiplying both sides of any equation by the same value is mathematically correct. Putting those values together allows us to get (2*d) + (2*c) = 2*(23), which then simplifies to 2d+2c = 2*23 = 46. From above, I mentioned 'let d be the number of dogs.' We know that d is 60 from the first part of the prompt, and since c=2d, it follows that c=2*60=120. But wait! You said c=d*2. And I'm saying c=2*d. Those aren't the same thing. They're actually different ways of writing the same equation c=2d, which is equivalent to d=c/2. Since you wrote it the other way around, then you got c=2*d. My bad! Since c=2*d we also now know that c=d*2, just written the opposite way. And we know that c is equal to 2*d. We also know that d=60, so let's substitute that into the equation c=2d. This leads us to find that c=(2)*60=120. So we've confirmed what we got above that c is indeed 120. Substituting this value back into our expression 2d + 2c we get 2(60)+2(120)=120+240=360.
