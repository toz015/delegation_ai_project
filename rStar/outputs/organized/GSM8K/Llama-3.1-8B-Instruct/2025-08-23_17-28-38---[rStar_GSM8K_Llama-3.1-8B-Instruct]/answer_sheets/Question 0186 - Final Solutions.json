Since each hamster received 5 pieces of straw, a total of 5 * 10 = 50 pieces were given out to them. And for the rabbits, since they received 20 pieces collectively, that information does not affect our computation about the number of rats, but we note this for future reference. Next, we calculate the number of pieces of straw received by the rats. This is simply the total number of pieces minus those given to the hamsters and rabbits. 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw for the rats. To find the number of rats, we take this total (which is 90) and divide by the number of straw each rat receives (which is 6). Thus we have 90 / 6 = 15 rats. To divide these into three groups with an equal number, we divide the number of rats (15) by the number of cages (3). The result of 15 / 3 = 5. Therefore there are 5 rats per cage.

The hint already told us how many pieces of straw the rats used: it was 90. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. We need to divide 90 by 6 to see how many rats there are.
