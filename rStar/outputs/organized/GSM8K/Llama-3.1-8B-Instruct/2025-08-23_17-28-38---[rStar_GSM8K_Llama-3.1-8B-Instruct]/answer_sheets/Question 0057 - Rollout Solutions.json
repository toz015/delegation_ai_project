First, we need to determine the maximum allowed weight of boxes the truck can carry. We know the bridge's capacity is 5000 pounds. However, since the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is already 3755 pounds, this limits the amount of cargo we can add. Therefore, the maximum weight of the boxes (including their own weight) cannot exceed 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we divide the remaining weight allowance (1245 pounds) by the weight per box (15 pounds). This results in 1245 \u00f7 15 = 83 boxes.
