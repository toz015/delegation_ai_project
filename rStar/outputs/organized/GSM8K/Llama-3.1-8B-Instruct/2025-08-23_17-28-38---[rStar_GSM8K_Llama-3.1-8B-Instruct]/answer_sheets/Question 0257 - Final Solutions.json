We already know it is 400 pounds per 10 feet. To get the weight of one foot of the tree, we divide 400 pounds / 10 = 40 pounds/foot. Since the tree is 200 feet tall, we can find its weight by multiplying the weight per foot times the number of feet. That would be 200 * 40 = 8000 pounds. The termites damaged 30% of this. To find out how much was damaged, we multiply 8000 pounds by 30%, or .3 * 8000 = 2400 pounds. Subtracting this amount leaves us with 8000 - 2400 = 5600 pounds.

First, we need to find out the weight of the whole tree. We can figure this out by using the given 10 foot section of tree as our unit. A 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds. The whole tree is 200 times longer than that. So the whole tree would weigh 400 pounds * 200. That comes out to be 80,000 pounds. The next step is to calculate how much of the tree was eaten by termites. Termites eat 30% of the tree. This means 30% of the 80,000 pound tree was eaten. We can express 30% as 30/100 or 0.3. To get 30% of 80,000, we multiply 0.3 * 80,000 = 24,000 pounds. Therefore, the amount of weight lost due to termite infestation is 24,000 pounds.
