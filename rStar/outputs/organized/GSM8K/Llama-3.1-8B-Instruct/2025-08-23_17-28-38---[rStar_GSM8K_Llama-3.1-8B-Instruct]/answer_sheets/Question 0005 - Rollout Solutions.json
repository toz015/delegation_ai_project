Half of 16 is 8, so there are 8 cheap glasses. Let's call the expensive glass 5 dollars. A regular glass would cost 100% of the original price (or 5). We're looking for the inexpensive glass which would cost 60%. First, we'll multiply the expensive glass by its cost per number (which was not specified) or simply use it as a ratio by dividing the amount of glasses of that type to the other. Since there are 8 of each type, we can simplify by dividing 1 of the inexpensive glasses by 8 and multiplying that result by 8 of the cheap glass to determine the cost of one inexpensive glass, using it instead of a ratio since that way the work stays simple for a large equation like this. Since one inexpensive glass is going to cost us .60 times the cost of a regular glass, that means the inexpensive glass will be 1(.60)=$0.60 times a regular glass which costs 5. Therefore, 0.60*5=3.00.
