We already know property tax was 6000 dollars. So his net income is $24000 - $2400 - $6000 which equals 15600 dollars. Lastly, we can calculate the difference in their values. $24000 - $15600 is equal to 8400.

In Job A, he earns $15 per hour for 2000 hours/year. His annual salary is therefore $15 * 2000 = $30,000."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First let's calculate Nick's annual salary in Job A before taxes. He earns $15/hour for 2000 hours/year. That means he gets paid $15 * 2000 = $30,000. However, he has a 20% state tax rate. To find 20% of 30000, multiply 30000 by .2. 30000 * .2 = 6000. So he pays $6000 in taxes. To get his take-home pay, subtract $6000 from $30000. $30000 - $6000 = $24000. Now let's look at Job B. He gets paid $42000 for the year, but has a 10% tax rate on all income over $6000. 10% of (42000-6000) = .1 * (42000-6000) = .1 * 36000 = 3600. Then we add back the $6000 because we already know he can't claim it as taxable income. So in total he has to pay $3600 in taxes. But we need to remember that he also pays $6000 in property taxes, so we can subtract both $3600 and", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
