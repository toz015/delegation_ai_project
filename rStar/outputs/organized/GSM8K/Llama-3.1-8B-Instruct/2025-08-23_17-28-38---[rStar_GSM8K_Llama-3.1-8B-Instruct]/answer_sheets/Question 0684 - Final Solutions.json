They will arrive before they run out of time because they only need 28 minutes. However, this contradicts our previous statement, therefore reevaluation needs to happen. If they go from point A to B to C, the return trip should be symmetric, and thus the correct answer should account for symmetry, but then why wouldn't it take the same amount of time going home. We should just calculate the return, considering the last segment from the school. This might make sense with our previous information about 6 minutes to get to the library. Considering these points, let's use 28 minutes for our calculations. We still do not know how much time we save due to symmetry unless the problem explicitly says the distances are the same; we still don't know whether the return from school is shorter because they've covered some ground during the way there. Based upon given data, the minimum return time, however, is indeed 19 minutes longer than the time between library and school, so let's set up the equation for the time spent getting back home. There are 2 unknowns - the initial segment from school to the library (which we could consider being part of the return) and the time between the library and the school. As stated earlier, it took 19 minutes after leaving the library and 6 minutes to reach the library. Therefore, our return times are 19 minutes for the second leg and x for the first leg. 19 + x must be less than 30 minutes because there's no mention of waiting around to help anyone else. To solve the above inequality, subtracting 19 from both sides results in x < 11. Then, there is the possibility that the return trip time equals 10 minutes, allowing them to leave the school within their allocated 30 minutes. However, we do not actually know the distance from school back to the library yet. Now assume we've traveled a certain distance from school to library before the 6 minutes to library, if the distances are the same for every leg then this distance would also be 10. If this were true, then the return trip (for each one-way leg) would indeed be symmetrical, meaning 10 minutes per leg for the return trip from school to library.
