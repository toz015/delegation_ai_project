Since the problem says we're considering the perspective of either train alone, let's think about what we know about the movement of one train. One train goes 80 miles to the west on the first day and 150 miles to the north on the second day. To figure out how far the train went on the first day, just look at the 80 miles given. That means each train traveled 80 miles on the first day because they moved in the same direction and at the same speed. On the second day, the information directly states that both trains moved 150 miles. Because both trains moved the same amount on the second day as well, the total distance of one train is 80 + 150 = 230. The other train also moves the exact same amounts every day and thus covers the same distance as the first train, so it is 230 miles per train.

One where the trains actually went westward for both days, or one where they had 55+75=130 miles added together for the last day's movement westward in addition to the initial 160 (total) of westward movement on the first day, resulting in the total being either 155 or 200 miles respectively.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "If instead, you use a different method that assumes each train continues with the opposite direction every day from the others, calculate the total distance for each train over two days?", "subanswer": {"text": "Train 1 goes 80 miles westward and then moves 150 miles northward. This totals 230 miles. The trains, however, moved 80 miles on both the first and second days and were each 150 miles apart on the second day after turning north; this results in 30 miles (half of the 60 miles that each train traveled east-west) + 75 (the missing westward distance needed to make up the last day's travel) + 80 (distance covered the first day westward) for each train.
