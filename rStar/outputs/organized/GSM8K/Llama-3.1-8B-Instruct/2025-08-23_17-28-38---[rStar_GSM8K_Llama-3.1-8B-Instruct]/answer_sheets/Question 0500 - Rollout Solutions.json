We start by defining our variables: L for Lily, D for David, and B for Bodhi. The first equation comes from the fact that together they found 43 insects: L + D + B = 43.

Substituting B = 2D into the first equation, we get L + D + 2D = 43 which simplifies to L + 3D = 43.\n\nNow, substituting the second piece of information (L = D + 7) into this simplified equation, we get (D + 7) + 3D = 43, or combining like terms, we have 4D + 7 = 43.
