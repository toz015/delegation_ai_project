There are also 3 people who refuse to wear masks. And there are 3S people who were kicked out for physical violence. The sum of these numbers should be equal to 50 (the total number of kicks-outs). That is, S + 3 + 3S = 50. This simplifies to 4S + 3 = 50. Subtracting 3 from both sides yields 4S = 47. Dividing both sides by 4 gives us S = 11.75. Since you can't kick someone out of the store for a fraction of a person, we round down to 11. But since we've already established that 4S - 5 = 7, S should be exactly 4. Thus, S = 4 and 3S = 12, making up 16 kicks-outs. Then 50 - 16 = 34 kicks-outs remain for not wearing masks.
