We know the lengths of one roll and one croissant, but not the baguette. First we need to find the combined length of all the rolls and croissants. There are 300 rolls (each 4 inches), and 120 croissants (each 6 inches). 300 * 4 = 1200. 120 * 6 = 720. 1200 + 720 = 1920. Next we need to convert 2 feet into inches since the question asks us to report our answer in inches. 1 foot equals 12 inches so 2 feet would equal 24 inches. Since we want to know about just the baguette, we can subtract the length of all the other baked goods from the combined total. This leaves us with 3000 - 1920 = 1080.
