To solve for $x, add $8 to both sides of the equation, getting $x = $83. This means that before spending the $8, he had a total of $83. After spending the $8, he had $83 - $8 = $75.

If he ends up with triple of ($x-$8), then this value equals $33+$y. In order for us to figure out what x is, we simply divide both sides by three and add eight to both sides. Thus we get: $x=$\\frac{33+y}{3}+8$. But look back and see we defined $y$ to be the extra cash acquired beyond $33 and its accompanying costs, and since we don't actually know y, we'd better define $y$ using an expression rather than an actual number. So instead of defining y as some unknown constant or value, we'll use an expression to represent it. After he saves $y$ dollars and adds it to his existing $33, he then proceeds to triple his overall total: $(33+y)*3$. This result is said to equal his final amount of money, $33+\\text{some }$other cash. From here, you might say $y$ is the difference between these two totals, although this may sound confusing. In reality, though, it seems like a more logical choice to make, so go ahead and do it anyway! In this scenario, if we subtract $33 from both sides, we'd be left with $(y)$=the remainder when dividing $33 by $3$, plus a little something extra, so we could write the equation $(y)=10+$extra stuff. This would make sense because if $33$ divided by $3$ is $11$, then $y$ is equal to the difference between $33$ and $11$ (or $22$), leaving $11$ as our $33/3$ term. And remember how I mentioned that the problem states that there is still more money? Well, the reason for this is that when you take that $11$ dollar amount and multiply it by $3$, you get $33$, and that makes perfect sense because that is exactly what we wanted in the first place, so this works perfectly fine as well. To continue solving for $y$, we just plug our previous values back into the $(y)=10+$something else equation, where something else is represented by a variable (let's call it $z$) to keep things simple. As a result, we get the equation $(y)=10+z$. Next, we want to determine what $z$ is.
