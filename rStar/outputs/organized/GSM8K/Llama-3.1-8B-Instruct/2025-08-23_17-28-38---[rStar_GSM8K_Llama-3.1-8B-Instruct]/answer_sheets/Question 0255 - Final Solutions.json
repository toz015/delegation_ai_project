There are now 240 cows. Ten stalls can now hold 240 cows. But we're told there will be 20 stalls eventually. That means the 10 original stalls need to be split into 10 separate stalls. We will have 10 stalls with 24 cows in each because 240/10 = 24. The problem asks us to find out how many cows are housed in each of the first eight stalls. Since the first ten stalls were split into 20, we would say the original first eight are now ten different stalls. The first ten would still be 24. We can also see that the last four stalls of those ten would hold their original amount of cows which was twenty. Therefore the first eight would have twenty one less cow than the rest. Twenty cows plus twenty one is 41. \n\nHowever as per the steps mentioned earlier we know that the original ten stalls had twenty cows each and we need to distribute 240/10 which is 24 cows, so we go with this number of cows per stall being twenty four. \n\nSo if 24 is the correct amount of cows per stall for", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
