To find out the number of worker bees, let's express the relation between worker bees and baby bees using condition 2. Since there are two types of bees other than the queen (the worker and baby), and the fact that the sum of all three should equal 700, we can create an equation: Worker bees + Baby bees + Queen bees = Total bees. By substituting the ratios, this becomes 2B + B + B/2 = 700. We simplify this to get 7B / 2 = 700. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 7B = 1400. Dividing both sides by 7, we get B = 200. This means that there are 200 baby bees. Using the second condition, the number of worker bees is 2B which equals 400. Therefore, there are 400 worker bees.

Condition 2 states that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, which means the baby bees make up half the population of worker bees. We already know that there are 700 worker bees. So if baby bees are half of that, then there are 350 baby bees. Condition 3 says that baby bees are twice as common as queens. That means there are only half as many queens as there are baby bees. Therefore, there are 350 / 2 = 175 queens. To find the total number of bees in the hive, we simply add these three numbers together: 700 + 350 + 175 = 1225 bees. But what we need is not the total but the number of worker bees. From the beginning of our thought process, we can see that the original statement said the number of worker bees equals two times the number of baby bees. Therefore, since we already found out that there are 350 baby bees, it makes sense that there are indeed 2 * 350 = 700 worker bees.

We know from condition 2 that the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees. And we know from condition 3 that the number of baby bees is twice the number of queen bees.

Since the ratio of worker bees to baby bees is two to one, that means if there are B baby bees, there are 2B worker bees.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 yields 3B = 1400. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3 yields B = 466.67, but because you can't have a fraction of a bee, it must mean that the number of baby bees rounded down is 466 since that makes sense.
