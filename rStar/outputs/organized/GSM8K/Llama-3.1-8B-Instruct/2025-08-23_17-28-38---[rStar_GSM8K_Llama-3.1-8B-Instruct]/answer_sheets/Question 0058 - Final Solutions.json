Adding back those extra fees, the total cost including all fees and tips will be 33 + 8.25 + 7 = 48.25 dollars. However, this isn't answering the question, instead we need to go back one step and correct the initial path. First, we know the total cost including all fees and tips is 40+3+4=47 dollars.

Solving for x, we find x = 47/1.25 = 37.6. However, since the grocery price must be an integer, let's try another approach. Instead of trying to solve for the grocery price directly, we can use the fact that 100% + 25% of the grocery price is 47 dollars. We'll express the grocery price as x. We can then write an equation like this: 1.25x = 47. But, if you simplify this equation, it still doesn't account for the integer result. To make it work, we need to rephrase our equation. The grocery price plus a 25% fee plus a delivery fee of 3 dollars plus a tip of 4 dollars equals 47 dollars. So, we could represent this mathematically as x + 0.25x + 3 + 4 = 47.

We should first calculate the total amount the extra charges are worth. We can do this using another variable. Call the extra charges X. We already know X equals 3+0.25*40+4, which we calculated earlier as equaling fifty seven. But since we also know this 57 extra charge, plus the original 40 equals 97.

To find out how much the extra costs added up to, subtracting the original charge from the final charge will give us: 57 - 40 = 17. Thus, the extra costs added 17 dollars to his original bill. However, the problem asks for the original price, not the total or net result, so the extra costs of 17 dollars do not apply here. We look back at condition 1 which states that the 'initial cost' is 40 dollars. Since 'initial' implies 'first', the term 'extra charges' could potentially mean anything other than the base cost. This makes sense only if the charge that was added (the delivery fees plus the tip) were actually meant to be considered under the category of 'extra'. By definition, one cannot call the original charge an 'extra'. Thus, considering extra charges would imply adding some kind of extra sum onto something else. In this case, the correct procedure should be simply looking at condition 1 without looking at any extra charges mentioned later because they're clearly outside the scope described.

Since the term 'extra charges' refers to any charges beyond the initial cost stated in the first condition, and those are clearly defined as the costs included in the later conditions such as delivery fees and the tip, we can consider the original price stated in the question as the actual value.
