{"id": 660, "problem": "Lee rears only sheep and geese on his farm.  If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, how many sheep live on Lee's farm?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.\nTherefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.\nThe animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.\nUsing the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.\n2g + 80 - 4g = 70.\n2g = 10.\nThere are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.\nThere are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.\n#### 15", "gold_answer": "15"}
