A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper. So a watermelon is 3 x 15 = 45 dollars. Next, we know that an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. That means an orange is 45 - 5 = 40 dollars. Now that we know all the prices, let's add up how much Dillon spent on watermelons. Each watermelon is 45 dollars, so four watermelons will cost 45 x 4 = 180 dollars. Dillon also spent 20 x 15 = 300 dollars on peppers. And he spent 10 x 40 = 400 dollars on oranges.
