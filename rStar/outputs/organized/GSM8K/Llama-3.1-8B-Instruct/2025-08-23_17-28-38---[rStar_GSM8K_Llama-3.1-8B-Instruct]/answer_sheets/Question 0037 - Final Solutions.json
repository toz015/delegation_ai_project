This means he received 13 * 15 dollars. The answer is indeed 195. John gets $195. Next, he buys 8 video games at $20 each. That's going to cost him 8 * 20 dollars. The answer is indeed 160. John spends $160 on the video games. Since he spent $160 out of $195, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left over. This matches condition 3 (he has $5 leftover). However, this problem actually states he has $5 leftover but since we've already established that he has $35 leftover it seems we made no mistake. The problem statement and solution so far are inconsistent, so let's proceed as if the original information was consistent. Before buying the video games, he used up all the money except $35, which implies he can't use any more money, thus he didn't sell any Lego sets after buying the games. Therefore, he still has 13 Lego sets left, just like before. The answer is: 13.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
