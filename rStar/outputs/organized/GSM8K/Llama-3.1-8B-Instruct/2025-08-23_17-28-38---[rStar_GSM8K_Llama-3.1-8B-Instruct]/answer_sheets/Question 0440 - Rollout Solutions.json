The formula for the area of a rectangle is length times width. We know the area (length times width) is 360. Let L represent the length and W the width. L * W = 360. Unfortunately we don't know either of those yet! But we can still work this out if we use another equation. Since we're looking for the width, let's express the length in terms of the width. From our first equation we get that length equals 360 divided by width, or L = 360/W. Now substitute the expression for length into our other equation. That gives us (360/W)*W = 360. Simplifying that gives 360 = 360. This looks hopeless, but remember: when you multiply a number by a fraction equal to 1, it doesn't change value. So let's simplify things by dividing both sides of the equation by 360. When you divide both sides of the equation by 360, you get W/W= 1.
