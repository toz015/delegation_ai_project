We know that Gerald was 2 seconds slower than Lee when both ran their personal best times before Gerald changed his diet. This means Gerald took 2 seconds longer than Lee so we can write this as: Gerald's time = Lee's time + 2 seconds. Since Gerald changed his diet and got 10% faster, we need to calculate 10 percent of his original time first, and then subtract this amount from his original time to find out what his new time will be. To calculate 10% of Gerald's original time, multiply 0.1 (which is 10%) and Gerald's time. Gerald's original time is equal to Lee's time + 2 seconds. So Gerald's time is 40 seconds (38 seconds + 2 seconds). 10 percent of Gerald's original time is 0.1 * 40 = 4 seconds.
