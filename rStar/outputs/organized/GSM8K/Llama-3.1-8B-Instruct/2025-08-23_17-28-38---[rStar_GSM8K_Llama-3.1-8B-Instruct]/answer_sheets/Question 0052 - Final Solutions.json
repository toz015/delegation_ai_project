If we multiply 1/2 by the number of toys (let's call that number \"y\") then we get the total weight. But we already know that removing 30 comic books weighed 15 pounds. We also know each comic book weighed 1/4 pound. In Question 5.1, we found out that removing all 30 comic books equal 15 pounds. Therefore 30 * (1/4) = 15 pounds. This means y * (1/2) should equal the difference between the weight removed and what he got from the comic books, which is 0 since taking all comic books makes him achieve the goal of 15 pounds off. However, since he actually removed 30 of them, not all, he still needs to get 15 pounds off by taking out toys only. Since the value in this equation equals zero, then no amount of toys multiplied by 1/2 (or any other constant) can equal 0. That implies that y should just be zero, but it cannot be, because that would make no sense when thinking about real life scenarios. This means we've reached an impasse. Revisit Question 5.1 for clues. Question 5.1 implies Uriah got rid of 15 pounds by taking out 30 comic books. These 30 comic books weigh a certain amount. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, therefore the 30 of them weigh 30 / 4 = 7.5 pounds. To reach 15 pounds, you can find out that the rest must be made up by a toy weighing 1/2 pound multiplied by some integer representing its count. Therefore, subtracting the comic book weight (7.5 pounds) from the 15 pounds leaves us with 15 - 7.5 = 7.5. Now, divide 7.5 by 0.5 (the weight of one toy), which gives you the number of toys needed to be removed: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.
