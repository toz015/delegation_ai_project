We know that we have 4 buses which can carry up to 240 people, 6 minibuses which can carry up to 180 people, and 10 minivans which can carry up to 150 people. To find the most efficient way to transport as many people as possible, let\u2019s see if adding all these vehicles can exceed the minimum number of needed vehicles to add the last passenger. If not, then it would seem reasonable to just take all the passengers from one type of vehicle (e.g., all buses). The hint suggests that taking all passengers from the largest vehicle (buses) yields 240, which seems like the best option since you don\u2019t want to leave any empty space in your buses when you could use them fully for 240 people. That leaves only the possibility of using either minibuses or minivans or both to bring in more people since taking all buses doesn\u2019t need more than 240.
