John drinks a glass of water before each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and one before bedtime (for a total of four glasses per day), 5 days a week. That's 4 * 5 = 20 glasses of water per week from meals and bedtime. Since he drinks no water at all at night on weekends but only on Monday through Friday, we don't need to add any additional water here because the other hint already accounts for it. We just consider Monday to Friday. This calculation gives us 20 glasses of water. No need to adjust this value as it matches the hints perfectly. So John drinks 20 glasses of water each week.
