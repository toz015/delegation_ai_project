Thus, we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Thursday in order to solve this question. To do so, let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Thursday as z. Thus, we can write that y+z = 0 (since he didn't watch 30-minute episodes on Wednesday). However, this contradicts the fact that Frankie watched both 1-hour and 30-minute episodes on Thursday, which makes our assumption incorrect. In reality, Frankie must have watched x 1-hour episodes on Thursday. We now need to use condition 6. The total minutes of TV watched is 7 hours. First, we subtract 1-hour episodes (excluding those he watched on Friday) to get the minutes spent watching the remaining 30-minute episodes: (24 + 0 + 0 + x + 12)/60 * 60 = (36+x).

Thus, the total TV time is 60y + 0 + 60x + 30z + 240 (from Friday). Frankie watched a total of 7 hours, or 420 minutes. Therefore, 60y + 60x + 30z + 240 = 420. Since Frankie only watched 30-minute episodes on Wednesday and Thursday, the equation simplifies to 60y + 60x + 30z + 240 = 420. Then 60y + 60x + 30z = 180. We already know that on the first two days Frankie watched a total of 24 hours worth of 1-hour episodes, so 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes, and Frankie also watched 1-hour episodes on Friday, totalling 15 hours worth of 1-hour episodes, so 15 * 60 = 900 minutes. Therefore, the total minutes spent watching 1-hour episodes on all three days, excluding Wednesday, is 1440 + 900 = 2340 minutes. The problem states that there are 1440 minutes of 1-hour episodes watched, and therefore 1440 minutes of 30-minute episodes must be subtracted. By solving 60y + 60x + 30z = 180 with the information we just obtained, we can determine the value of x and z and thereby calculate Frankie's viewing time on Wednesday. Solving 60y + 60x + 30z = 180 for y we get that y = 1 - 18x/20 - 3z/20. With x + z being an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive (since the total viewing time on these three days is 420), we see that if we set x=0 then the range of possible values for z will be 1 <= z <= 21 (for y >0).

Let y represent how many 30-minute episodes he watched. If we consider the other 3 days, he watched 1440 minutes of 1-hour episodes. We need to add these with the y * 30 minutes of 30-minute episodes. In total, this adds up to 1440 + 30y minutes. According to condition 6, the total is 7 * 60 minutes = 420 minutes. Setting these equal yields the equation 1440 + 30y = 420. Subtracting 1440 from both sides yields 30y = -1020. Dividing both sides by 30 results in y = -34. However, since negative number doesn't make sense here, let's go back to Question 5.2 to find the error. On Thursday, he watched both 1-hour and 30-minute episodes. Since he already watched 12 one hour episodes on Monday and Tuesday, and 12 more on Friday, he only needs to watch x-12 1-hour episodes on Thursday. So there are (x-12)*60 + 30*y minutes on Thursday. Substituting this into the equation 1440 + 30y + (x-12)*60 + 30y = 420 to find y yields 1440 + 60(x-12) + 60y = 420, then 60x - 720 + 60y = -1260, then 60x + 60y = -960, and finally dividing both sides by 60 results in x + y = -16. To check if this is correct, substitute y = -16-x back into the original problem. If x=-22,y=-6, and x=25, y=-31. These numbers don't work because they make no sense in real life or in this problem. Only when y = -6 - (-22) - 12 = -2 and x = 25 - (-6) = 31, does the equation hold true. So the original equation x+y=-16 should be rewritten as x+y=14. Then y = 14 - x. Plugging this back in the equation from Question 5.2, it becomes (x-12)60 + 30(14-x) = 30(14-y).
