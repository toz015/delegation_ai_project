{"id": 647, "problem": "Bill is trying to dig a well in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he has to dig through 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay, how long will it take him to dig the well?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour\nThen find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours\nThen find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours\nThen add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
