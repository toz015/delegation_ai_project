{"id": 507, "problem": "Janet takes two bus trips five days a week. If each bus trip costs her $2.20, how much would she save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week\nThen multiply this number by the cost per trip to find her current weekly spending: 10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $<<10*2.20=22>>22/week\nThen subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this number to find her savings: $22/week - $20/week = $<<22-20=2>>2\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
