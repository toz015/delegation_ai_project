George is getting two implants, so 2 * $2000 is 4000 dollars for just the implants. However, he also wants to add a crown to one implant, which costs 500 dollars. This is one crown, not both, since it is said \"for one of the implants\". George paid a 600 dollar deposit. So, for two implants (with one having a crown), the cost will be 4000 + 500 + (-600) = 3900 dollars. But what about the dentist fee? Unfortunately, there is no information about this so we cannot calculate this fee. We only know how much George works per hour so lets keep going with that. If he makes $15 per hour working at his job. Let us assume he needs to make up the remaining amount to afford the whole procedure. First, however, let us see if it is possible for him to earn the remaining amount. To do this, lets find out how much he needs to make: The remaining amount is the total cost minus the deposit plus any additional cost, which was found earlier. So this is 3900 - 600 = 3300, and adding the additional 500 for the crown results in 3800", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Since we assumed George needed to earn the difference, we now know that he must earn 3800 dollars to cover the rest of his expenses."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.

But George has already paid a 600 dollar deposit. This leaves him having to pay 4500 - 600 = 3900 dollars. This is also equal to 3800 + 100. We can assume this mistake was not intentional. Also, it is safe to say George earns 15 dollars an hour, so if he works 'x' amount of hours he would make 15x dollars. Therefore to make up for the remaining balance of 3900 dollars he would have to make at least 3900 dollars.
