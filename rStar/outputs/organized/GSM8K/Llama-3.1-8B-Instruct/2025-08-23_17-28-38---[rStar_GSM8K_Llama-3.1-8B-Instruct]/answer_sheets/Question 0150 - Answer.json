{"id": 150, "problem": "Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.\nIt will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.\nTim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.\nIt will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.\nSteve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.\n#### 4", "gold_answer": "4"}
