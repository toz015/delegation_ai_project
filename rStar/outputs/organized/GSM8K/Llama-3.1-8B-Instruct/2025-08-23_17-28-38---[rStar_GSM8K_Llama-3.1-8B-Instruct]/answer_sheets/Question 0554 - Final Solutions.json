Since we already determined it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water, let's recall it took him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water. Therefore, it is 34 - 16 = 18 minutes faster (or longer) to swim a mile in warm water compared to cold water. However, this prompt asks for a comparison of times over 3 miles. Let's assume he swims 3 miles in cold water and warm water. To find out how long it takes Ray to swim three miles on a cold day, multiply 3 by the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. That is 3 * 16 = 48. And to find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles on a warm day, multiply 3 by the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water. That is 3 * 34 = 102.
