The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice as many, so it is 54 x 2 = 108 lines. Only a third of these are Sean's, which would be 108 / 3 = 36 lines. The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these are Sean's, which would be (4/5) * 60 = 48 lines. To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we add up all of his lines: 36 + 48 + 54. This equals 138. The answer is 138. However, upon reviewing my work, I realize that I used some extra information from other parts of the problem, when the question asked us to focus solely on what it says. Since that was wrong, let me revise the steps. The solo song has 54 lines. That's the only bit of information we have about the song. So, Sean has to memorize 54 lines from the solo song. The answer is 54. However, the real issue here is that the question asks us to do something different. In fact, if you compare it to the prompt, you'll notice that they say \"his solo song has 54 lines\", not \"Sean's solo song has 54 lines\". That means we don't know whether those lines belong to Sean or not. The correct interpretation should be that the question tells us the total number of lines in the solo song, not how many lines Sean has to memorize from it. We cannot determine the answer using only the given information. Let me revise the whole thing again, then. The solo song has 54 lines. That's the only bit of information we have about the song. We also have that Sean will recite a part of the first scene, a part of the second scene, and the entire solo.
