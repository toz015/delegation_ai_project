Condition 1 tells us we have two options: $5000 worth of jewelry or $8000 worth of gadgets. Condition 2 gives us the growth rates. Jewelry grows by 2.5% and gadgets grow by 1.2%. So let's first calculate the profit for both options, assuming no profit was made initially (we're just looking at potential profit). Profit for $5000 jewelry would be 5000 x .025 = $125. Profit for $8000 electronics would be 8000 x .012 = $96. The difference in profit is $125 - $96 = $29.
