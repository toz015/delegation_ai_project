To calculate the amount she'll pay if she pays 50% more than the minimum, we need to find out how much extra money she'd pay. 50 percent of $1000 is $1000 / 2 = $500. This means she would add $500 to the original $1000. The new total would be $1000 + $500 = $1500. Since this is a monthly amount, we can multiply it by 12 (months) to get the yearly total: $1500 * 12 = $18,000.
