Since only the female members agreed to perform (Condition 2), this leaves us with 26 females performing. But half of these women couldn't make it because their bus broke down (Condition 3). That means we need to divide the number of female performers in half. 26 / 2 = 13. This means only 13 out of the original 26 female performers could make it. We also need to consider the fact that three choir teachers chose to act as substitutes to fill the vacant spots (Condition 4).
