Option B is cheaper because it costs $9 compared to $15 for option A. Thus, by buying 18 flowers at the lower cost, Vincent saves $15 - $9 = $6. The answer is: $6.  But this was wrong. Vincent pays $9 not $15 when he purchases 18 flowers at the lower cost. Therefore he pays $15 - $9 = $6 less when buying the cheaper option but that isn't correct since the cheaper option is $9 not $", "value": 0.71875}}}, "rollout_id": 28}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
