According to condition 1, 2 vaccines will cost $40 (which was already answered). The question states that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. This implies that the heartworm check is not known yet. To find out how much John needs to pay, we first add the vaccine price and the heartworm check cost. But since we don't know what the heartworm check costs, let's call it X. So far John pays $40 for vaccines and X for heartworm check. Let's continue. We know that X makes up 60% of the entire charge. Therefore the heartworm check costs 0.6x. According to condition 3, John has $125 initially. So after paying $40 for the vaccines, and X for the heartworm check, he still has money. Now we can write this as follows: 100-0.6(x) = 125 - 40. Since we are solving this equation for x, we rearrange this to get 0.4(x) = 85. Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get x = 212.50. So X = $212.50.
