There are a total of 240 + 80 = 320 people who are either Japanese or Asian. Since there are people other than those categories too, we subtract this total from all the people (assuming it is 100% if no other category is specified). 100 - 32 = 68 (rounding to a whole percentage) or 100% - 99.75%. It's easier to do the math using percentages. We know 25% are Japanese, and 30% are Asian. We can express these numbers as decimals instead and add them together (0.25 + 0.30 = .55) which equals approximately 55% of the group. This means about 45% aren't Japanese or Asian. With 100%, this would equal 0.45 * 100 = 45. To find out the actual amount of non-Japanese/Asians, multiply this number by 500 (100% in decimal form): 45 * 500 = 22500.

Since there are 240 Asians and 80 Japanese, we know they both are part of the larger Asian group. But we also need to take into consideration that 80 Japanese are part of the 240 Asians. The correct total is then 240 + 80 = 320. However since we're trying to get the total amount of Chinese people, let's go back to the beginning and rephrase our question. \"How many Chinese people are there?\" Well, we know that out of 100%, 30% are Asian. We also know that the total amount of people is 320. Since 30% represent all the Asian people, you would divide 320 by .30. 320 \u00f7 .30 = 1066.67. You must remember however, that you cannot have .66 of a person. Therefore, the best way to approach this question is by first determining how many people are not Asian/Japanese. Then, find out the total Chinese population. Here's how it goes... In a previous question, Question 5.1, I showed how to figure out the answer to this part: 100% - 55% = 45% or 0.45 * 100 = 45. Multiply this number by 500, which represents the total population: 45 * 500 = 22,500. This may look like an answer but wait, what? Did the creator make a mistake when making the problem? No. It is a test to see how well you handle problems! Remember the trick from earlier, let's say there are 500 people. In the beginning, it says there are 240 Asians. We will use this information along with the fact that there are 320 people total to come up with a solution. Here is the solution: Determine the percentage of the group that isn't Japanese/Asian and we've already done that in Question 5.1. So, let's try something different this time: Assume the total amount of people is 500 and there are 240 Asians. The remaining people will be in the other group, therefore 500 - 240 = 260 non-Asians. We now know that 26% are Japanese and 30% are Asian. Adding the two percentages together we get 56. Since the other 44% weren't represented, you just plug in the values into an equation.
