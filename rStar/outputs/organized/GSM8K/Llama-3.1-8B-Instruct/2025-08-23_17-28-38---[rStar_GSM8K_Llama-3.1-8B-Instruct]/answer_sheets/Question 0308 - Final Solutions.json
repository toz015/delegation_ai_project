First, find out how much is saved from one tub of ice cream. That is $13 - $11 = $2 per tub of ice cream. If you buy two tubs, that means you'll save 2 x $2 = $4 from the ice cream. Next, consider the milk. We don't actually need the milk's original price because the problem doesn't say the milk is on sale like the ice cream. Therefore, the milk will just have one $0.5 discount from its listed price, which we don't know either, or presumably, the regular price. To simplify, we can call the unknown original price 'x'. We already know the milk costs 'x' - 0.5. But again, the price of the milk isn't relevant to our calculation because the problem states there's only a single $0.5 discount, presumably taken once when it was first mentioned. Thus, all four packs of milk also get a single $0.5 discount each. Four times $0.5 is $2. Combine the $4 from the ice cream with the $2 from the milk. 4 + 2 = 6.
