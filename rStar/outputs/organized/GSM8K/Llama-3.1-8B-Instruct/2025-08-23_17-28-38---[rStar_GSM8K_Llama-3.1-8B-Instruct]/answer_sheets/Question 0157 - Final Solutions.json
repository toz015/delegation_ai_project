Since the length of the field is 100 yards, running back and forth across the field 15 times is equivalent to running 30 times the length of the field (since going back counts as an extra 'run'). Therefore, Blake ran 100 yards x 30 runs = 3000 yards.\nNext, we calculate how far Kelly ran during the first leg of her route. During the second leg of her route, we can ignore the fact that she only went halfway down the field and focus solely on the fact that she completed 34 full-length trips down the field. This means she ran 100 yards x 34 = 3400 yards.\nNow, let's add up the distances for both Kelly and Blake.

This sums up to 3600 yards for Kelly.\nSince we're interested in determining who ran farther, we need to find the difference between these two values. 3600 (Kelly's total) - 3000 (Blake's total) = 600.
