That could represent any multiple of twelve items, so that our twenty dozen items would really be 'some unknown multiple of twelve cups', because when you say some 'X dozen' number of cups, it's always understood to mean X times TWELVE cups (i.e., twenty dozen would be twenty-twelves), which makes the original statement make no sense mathematically without knowing some real number other than dozen.
