This price increases by 20% every two months. To find the price after 36 months, let's work out the effect of these increases over time. The first increase doubles the price ($40), then that doubled amount gets increased by 20%, which is $8 ($48 total), then another 20% increase makes it $57.60. But we can use a shortcut formula since it's a repeating process. After n intervals, the final price P can be found using P = 20(1 + 0.20)^n. Since there are 18 intervals of 2 months in our case, the final price would be 20(1 + 0.20)^18. Using calculator or computation tool, the result comes out to approximately $77.84.
