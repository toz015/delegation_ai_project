To find out how many hours Mike spends writing each week, we need to know how long it takes him to write all those letters. Since Mike receives 6 letters and each letter has 5 pages, we can calculate how many pages he needs to read and write in total. This equals 6 letters * 5 pages = 30 pages. Since it takes him 6 minutes to write one page, this means he spends 6 * 30 = 180 minutes writing. To convert this into hours, we divide 180 minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in one hour). Therefore, the time spent writing in hours is 180 / 60 = 3. The answer is: 3.", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
