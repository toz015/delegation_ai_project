Let's denote 'a' as the age of Darrell and 'b' as the age of Allen. We know a + b = 162. Using the hint 2, we know that b is 77, but since we want to find Allen's age in ten years, we first need to determine the value of 'b'. However, we actually know 'b' from the second hint. We were told that 'Allen is currently 77.' The question asks us to find out Allen's age 10 years from now, not right now. If you take Allen's current age and add 10 years, you get Allen's age 10 years from now. Allen's current age is 77. Adding 10 to his current age results in 77 + 10 = 87.
