First we need to calculate the percentage of the watermelons that were ready when Ashlyn arrived. To find 30%, multiply 120 by 0.3 (since 30% = 30 / 100 = 0.3). That is 36. 36 watermelons were ready, leaving 120 - 36 = 84. 84 watermelons remained. We can express this as a fraction 84 / 120 or simplify it further. Now, let's go through the second part of our problem. Of these, 3/4 were ready to be picked. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 100 makes this fraction easier to understand, since 3/4 = 75/100, or 75%. So, multiplying 84 by 0.75 yields 63.
