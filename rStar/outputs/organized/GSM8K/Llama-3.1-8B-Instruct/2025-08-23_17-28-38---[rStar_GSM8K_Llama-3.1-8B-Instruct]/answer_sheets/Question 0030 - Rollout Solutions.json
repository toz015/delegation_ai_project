But we need a specific value for their combined age. Let's use our knowledge about the problem given. We can assume the lowest common multiple of 7 and 11 (which is 77) as their ages because this way both 7x and 11x will turn into whole numbers and they add up perfectly well when their values are multiplied out. So Darrell would be 7x or 7 * 11 = 77, while Allen is 11x or 11 * 7 = 77. Therefore Darrell's age would be 77 and Allen's would also be 77. Their combined age is 77 + 77 which equals 154.

Let's denote 'a' as the age of Darrell and 'b' as the age of Allen. We know a + b = 162. Using the hint 2, we know that b is 77, but since we want to find Allen's age in ten years, we first need to determine the value of 'b'. However, we actually know 'b' from the second hint. We were told that 'Allen is currently 77.' The question asks us to find out Allen's age 10 years from now, not right now. If you take Allen's current age and add 10 years, you get Allen's age 10 years from now. Allen's current age is 77. Adding 10 to his current age results in 77 + 10 = 87.
