But since 5 cars left early, only those cars that arrived in the first 15 minutes would still be stuck. That includes 30 cars that started earlier and 20 cars that arrived later. This results in a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cars passing through the jam. However, since some of these might have arrived before 15 minutes had passed but actually drove out after, they shouldn't count towards those who 'passed through' within the first 15 minutes. To clarify this, let's remove the extra detail about their actual timing and just focus on their arrival order, which isn't relevant to answering our final question. The confusion arises from misinterpreting the task, focusing instead on how many entered the area during the first 15 minutes and not accounting for early departures. Actually, all cars starting from the beginning will eventually go through; however, if they leave early, they don\u2019t get counted among those that went through the jam when others did. In short, for simplicity, all cars that started before or during the first 15 minutes but left after that won't be considered as having gone through the jam, even though technically they could've done so had they stayed. Since 5 cars left early, subtracting these doesn't directly account for our final result, but it highlights an issue with overcounting due to their presence. Instead, note that you should consider only those who didn't leave early as being representative of those going through the jam. Thus, you need to find the total number of cars going through minus those leaving early. Simplifying further: to determine the correct number of vehicles that went through the traffic jam in its first 15 minutes, simply look at the initial total of cars plus any others arriving within the timeframe \u2013 then remove those who departed prematurely. We know 30 cars were already present initially. Then 20 more arrived within the specified time frame. But before counting, remove 5 who left early because they didn't experience the full duration of the jam like everyone else did; this reduces our base number of cars actually experiencing it fully within said timeframe down slightly below our combined total. Since they're excluded from entering that group due to leaving early, they wouldn't be included when considering what occurred only during those initial minutes anyway; thus, they simply don\u2019t belong here.
