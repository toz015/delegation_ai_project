Ali has 22 medals (Condition 1). Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali (Condition 2), so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals. When Ali and Izzy combined, we get 22 + 17 = 39. They have 10 times fewer medals than have been awarded, which means we need to find out what number times 10 equals 39. To find this number, divide 39 by 10 and you'll get 3.87.

This number represents only one tenth of all medals ever awarded. So the number of all the medals ever given is 39 x 10 = 390 medals. The answer is 390. However, the above process contained an error since a non-whole number appeared during a mathematical operation related to the task at hand. The provided solution doesn't consider the fact that medals should be whole numbers because they cannot be split. You could solve this problem considering Ali has 22 medals, then Izzy would have 17 (as previously solved) which results in 39 medals combined. You could divide this by ten since this is how many times fewer medals they have compared to medals being awarded and find the real value of medals ever given out. In reality, when you do 39 divided by ten, you will get 3.9. Considering that a medal is indivisible, this creates an issue since .9 of a medal is not logical in this context. To deal with this problem, I will provide another possible way to look at it. If you assume there's some sort of minimum number of medals that could have been awarded - e.g. 40. Then the solution becomes much clearer. The correct answer involves a guess of the minimum number of medals that could have been awarded, which then gets multiplied by ten. This results in 400.
