We want to know how long it'll take for the phone to go from 60% to 100%. That means we need to figure out how long it'll take to charge 40% of the battery. Since 1% charges in 3 minutes, then 40% will take 40 x 3 minutes. 40 x 3 is 120. It will take 120 minutes.

Condition 1 says it charges at a rate of 1/3 percentage points per minute. Condition 2 says it already has 60% charged. So, it needs 100 - 60 = 40%. Now we need to divide the time it takes to fill its battery completely by the rate at which it charges. This can be expressed as 40 / (1/3). We can simplify this expression using division of fractions rule as follows: 40 / (1/3) = 40 * 3 = 120 minutes. To convert this into hours, divide 120 minutes by 60. 120 / 60 = 2 hours.
