We don't know exactly how many friends either girl had. However, we can find out how many friends Amy made if we knew Lily's original number of friends. The problem isn't enough information to solve this question, but let me try to guess what might be going on here... Let's say Lily had 10 friends, which is just a guess. Then Amy had 30. But without knowing Lily's amount of friends, we cannot tell you exactly how many friends Amy has. Sorry! I'll provide an alternative answer since this one doesn't actually fit your required answer format (a simple number). This is not a suitable solution as it deviates from the instruction. A possible rewording could be:\n\nAmy has 2 more friends than Lily. If Lily has 5 friends, then Amy has 7. If Lily has 9 friends, then Amy has 11. Thus, we still can't determine how many friends Amy has because we need to know how many Lily has. We could write a function or equation to represent this relationship, like A = L + 2. Where A is the number of friends Amy has and L is the number of friends Lily has. If Lily has 20, then Amy has", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
