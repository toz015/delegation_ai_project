However, based on what is provided, we can use the difference to help us solve this problem because if we add up the number of wolves and cougars killed yesterday, and add up the number of wolves and cougars killed today, we get the same number since the difference is just a combination of the difference in wolf and cougar kills.

As for today, Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars. But we don't know how many wolves he killed yet, but we do know that he killed 12 cougars today (from the hint). Since Rick killed 3 times as many wolves as cougars, this means he killed 12 x 3 = 36 wolves. Therefore, Rick killed 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals today.
