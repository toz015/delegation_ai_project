We find this out by subtracting 40 hours from 45 hours, which is 45 - 40 = 5 overtime hours.\nStep 3: Calculate the overtime earnings\nFor every hour she works overtime (beyond the initial 40), she gets paid 1.2 times her regular hourly wage. Since Eliza makes $10/hour normally, she makes 10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour during overtime. To get the total overtime amount, multiply the number of overtime hours by the overtime rate: 12 * 5 = 60 dollars.\nStep 4: Sum up all earnings\nAdd together Eliza's regular earnings ($400) and her overtime earnings ($60).
