We know from question 5.1 that if the farm has F cows then the zoo has 2F cows. But what value of F will make sense?  In order to figure this out we need to use the fact that the zoo has 20 sheep which is equal to half the number of sheep the farm has. Let's represent the number of sheep the farm has with S. Then 1/2 S= 20 or S= 40. That is equivalent to saying that the farm has 40 sheep. To determine the value of F, note that when S=40, then the farm has 30 cows. Thus if the farm had F cows then the zoo would have 2F cows. Using the same logic as before, the farm has F cows which is equal to 30 and the zoo must have 2*30=60 cows. The problem states that the farm has 40 sheep which is half of the number of sheep that the zoo has. Using the same logic again, the zoo must have 2*40=80 sheep.
