From condition 2 we know each class has 15 students and from condition 3 we know each class costs 15 dollars to attend. So one class earns 15 * 15 dollars = 225 dollars. \nNow let's calculate the weekly earnings by adding up the income from each day of the week. The week consists of five weekdays (Monday through Friday) with 5 classes each and one saturday with 8 classes.\nSo the amount of money made during the weekdays is 5 * 5 classes * 225 dollars per class = 5625 dollars. During Saturdays it would be 8 classes * 225 dollars per class = 1800 dollars.\nFinally, the total weekly income can be calculated as follows: The weekday income plus the weekend income equals 5625 dollars + 1800 dollars. Therefore, 5625 + 1800 equals 7425 dollars. The answer is: 7425.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 21}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
