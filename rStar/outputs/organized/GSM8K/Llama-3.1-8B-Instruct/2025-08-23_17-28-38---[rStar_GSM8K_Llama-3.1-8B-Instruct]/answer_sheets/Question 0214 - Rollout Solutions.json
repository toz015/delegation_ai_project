Let's call the size of the smaller pool 'x'. 4 minutes ago the bigger pool had 2x. But right now (since 4 minutes passed), the smaller one would be 3 times emptier so its value would be 0.75x. And since it emptied 4 min ago and we're asking about now, its new size is going to be less than the original 4min-ago value. The same goes for the bigger pool, whose 4min-ago size was 2x, but now its size would be 4times of .75x which equals 3x. To make these equations equal to each other: \n(2x) / ((4-4)/60) = (3x) / ((3/4)*60). Because all three variables (time, length, & poolsize) depend on each other here (if time is greater, pool size increases inversely).\nThis can also be solved using algebra; however, it was decided not to use algebra because that is what you get when the question gets too hard.\nSimplifying this equation, the (4-4", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much water does the small pool have now?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since 4 minutes passed, the pools lost some water due to their leak. Given the previous information, we know that the big pool initially contained twice as much water as the small pool. That means if the big pool contains 3x water now, then the initial water level was 2x for the small pool. Since they leaked for the same amount of time, the water loss for each pool would be the same. However, since the big pool already started with twice as much water as the small pool, it still has twice as much water as the small pool, even though they've been leaking for the same amount of time. Therefore, if the small pool contains x units of water, the big pool will contain 2x units of water. We already calculated in Question 5.1 that the small pool contains 0.75x units of water, so the big pool must contain 2 * 0.75x = 1.5x units of water. The big pool has 1.5x units of water and the small pool has 0.75x units of water, so the difference between the two quantities is 1.5x - 0.75x = 0.75x units of water. Since 0.25x units of water have been leaking from each pool over the last 4 minutes, this means that the small pool must have contained 1 unit of water when the big pool contained 2 units. Since the small pool has leaked 0.25 units of water during those four minutes, it currently contains 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 units of water. The final result for x is not requested, just the answer to the number of gallons in the small pool. So let us multiply 0.75 by the initial total gallons for the pool. The original pool size was expressed as 'x' and 'y', but what we need to find is the amount of time it took to fill the larger pool.", "value": 0.125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
