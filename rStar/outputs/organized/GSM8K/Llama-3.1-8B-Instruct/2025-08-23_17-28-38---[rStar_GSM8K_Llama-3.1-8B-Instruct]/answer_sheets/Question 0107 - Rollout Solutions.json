Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. First let's figure out how many hours he watched on Monday and Tuesday. 2 nights times 1 hour per night is 2 hours. Then on Friday, he watched 2 hours. That means he watched 2 + 2 = 4 hours during those nights. That leaves 7 - 4 = 3 hours of TV time remaining. To find the total amount of minutes, we need to multiply by 60 (since 1 hour equals 60 minutes). This gives us 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. Frankie watched 30 minute shows one day and 1 hour long shows another. Since he watched 7 hours or 420 minutes in total, that means on Wednesday, he watched 180 - 120 (or 2 hours) = 60 minutes of TV. 60 / 30 = 2. Therefore, he watched 2 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday. The answer is: 2.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night.
