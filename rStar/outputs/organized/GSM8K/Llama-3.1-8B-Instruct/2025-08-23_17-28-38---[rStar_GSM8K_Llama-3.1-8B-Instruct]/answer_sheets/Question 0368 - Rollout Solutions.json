But this problem can actually be solved using basic subtraction and multiplication instead.\n\nErin has three times as many points as Sara. That means if Sara has x points, then Erin has 3x points. Since Erin scored 14 points in addition to what Sara already has, we could say Erin now has x + 14 points. Therefore, we know that x + 14 = 3x.

We know that Erin has 3 times as many points as Sara, so we can write an equation: Erin's points = 3(Sara's points). Erin currently has 14 points. So 14 = 3(Sara's points). To find Sara's points, we divide both sides by 3: Sara's points = 14 / 3 = 4.6667. But this isn't correct since Sara can only have whole points. Since Erin has 14 points and she has three times more points than Sara, we can say that Sara has 1/3 * 14 points. 1/3 * 14 = 4.6667. This is also not a whole number. Let's reevaluate our work. Erin has three times more points than Sara. So if Sara had X points, then Erin would have 3X points. However, we are told that Erin has 14 points and that Erin has three times more points than Sara, but that cannot be true. Let us rephrase our problem. If Erin has 14 points and that is three times as much as Sara, then let x represent Sara's score. So 14 = 3x. Divide both sides by", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Divide both sides by 3. You get 14 / 3 = x. It looks like we still don't have a solution because 14 divided by 3 doesn't equal a whole number. Therefore, there must be some other variable we need to use. Look at the first line again. There is no need for any additional variables. What does it mean when it says \"three times more\" points? It means that if Sara got 10 points then Erin got 30. But what if Sara got less than 10 points? Then Erin could get less than 30. In fact if Sara gets 0 points, then Erin gets 0 points and that is three times more! Aha! That is the catch. The word \"more\" is key! Since 14 is three times 4 point six seven, you know the answer now. When Erin got 14 points, that was three times four point six seven points more than Sarah. Which is the same thing as saying that when Erin got fourteen points, that was one more time that Sara got 4.6667 point seven points than when Erin got fourteen. Which is obviously true. So we finally understand. Erin got 14 points. And that was three times more points than Sara"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We already figured this out. Since we know that if Sara scores 0 points then Erin scores 0 points as well (because 3 x 0 = 0), we can say that if Sara scores x points then Erin scores 3x points. They also said that Erin has 14 points right now. So we need to find out how many points Sara has so that Erin would have 14 points. This means that 3x must equal 14. To solve this equation, we divide both sides by 3. 3x/3 = 14/3. x = 14/3. We have our value for x. Now that we have x, we can plug it into the original statement to see what happens. Erin has 3x points, which is equal to 3(14/3). Since division and multiplication cancel each other out, we get 14. The problem states that Erin now has 14 points. Erin has always had 14 points.
