Let's start with the pigeons. They ate 9 fries. Next, we need to find out how many fries were left after the pigeons ate their share. The original amount of fries was x. Before the pigeons came along, the raccoon had eaten 2/3 of the fries that were left after the seagull. This would be 2/3(x - 14 - 9). Simplifying this, we get 2/3(x - 23). After the raccoon finished its meal, there were x - 14 - 9 - 2/3(x - 23) fries left. But before that happened, ants had taken one more away. Therefore, we are looking for a value of x such that x - 14 - 9 - 2/3(x - 23) -1 = 5. Solving this equation, we can isolate x. Start by combining like terms:  x - 14 - 9 - 2/3(x - 23) -1 = 5. This becomes: x - 24 - 2/3(x - 23) = 10.

Let's try this backward: We know there was 1 left at the end. Before that, 2/3 of the remaining fries were eaten by the raccoon. This means the other 1/3 were left. That's 1 out of 3 times what's left equals 1 (the last french fry). So the whole thing would be 3. Before that, 3 x 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons. That means we have to add those back into the mix so that when the seagull eats half of what Dave ate, the equation still works. Before the pigeons eat any, there are 3 x 1 + 9 = 12 fries. But we need to add back all the ones the raccoon didn't eat. The raccoon ate 2/3 of what was left over after the seagull had eaten half of what Dave had. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 7. 13 fries were left after the seagull had eaten its portion. Two-thirds of these 13 fries were eaten by the raccoon, meaning 1/3 were left, which are also", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
