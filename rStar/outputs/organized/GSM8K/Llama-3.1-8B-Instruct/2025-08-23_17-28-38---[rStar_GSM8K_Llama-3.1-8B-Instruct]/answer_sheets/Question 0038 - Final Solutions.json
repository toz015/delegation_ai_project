The answer is 30.  I found the following solution for Question 5:  In 24 hours, you drive 60 * 24 / 168 = 7.1428571.  Multiply the result by the fraction of the day spent driving each day.  In a 24-hour day, the fraction of time spent driving each day is 3/7.  So in a 24-day week, that is 72 hours, multiply 7.1428571 * 3/7 = 3 hours/day * 24 days.  I get 36. This is wrong. I now understand why we got different results. Our problem states John runs 60 miles per week and 3 hours per week. Therefore, 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour on monday.  The problem also says he runs 3/2 hours (or 90 minutes) every day from tuesday to thursday, inclusive. So 3 hours on mondays + 1.5 hours on tuesdays + 1.5 hours on wednesdays = 6 hours total. 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.  To check my work, i have converted the answers from question 5.3 into fractions.   On monday, John runs for 3 hours at 20 miles per hour, so he covers 60 miles.  In terms of a fraction, 20 * 3/1 = 60. On tuesday and wednesday, he runs for 3/2 hours each day at 10 miles per hour, so he covers 15 miles each day.  This makes a total of 15 + 15 + 60 = 90 miles.  This matches the total miles run per week stated in the problem. Therefore, I am correct. This completes the proof.
