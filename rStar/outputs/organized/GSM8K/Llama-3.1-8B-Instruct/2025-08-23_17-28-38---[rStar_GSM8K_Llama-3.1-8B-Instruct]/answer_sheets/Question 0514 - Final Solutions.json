When he got home he realized he spent $0.50 more than what he paid at the checkout counter. How much money did Tom pay? Let's think step by step. Step 1: The problem states that when Tom got home, he realized he spent $0.50 more than what he paid at the checkout counter. This means if he paid $x at the counter, he actually spent x + $0.50 at home. Step 2: Since he spent $9 in total, including the additional $0.50, this means the amount he paid at the checkout counter plus the $0.50 must equal $9. Step 3: Set up the equation for the situation: x + $0.50 = $9, where x is the amount he originally paid at the checkout counter. Step 4: Solve for x by subtracting $0.50 from both sides of the equation: x = $9 - $0.50. Step 5: Perform subtraction to find the value of x. Step 6: Therefore, x = $8.50.
