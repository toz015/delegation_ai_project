Therefore, let us use it. Since 252 eggs are sold daily, we can find out how many dozens of eggs are sold daily because 1 dozen is equal to 12 eggs. 252 \u00f7 12 = 21 dozen eggs per day. We already found the price per dozen egg: $2. To find the amount earned per day multiply the amount of dozens of eggs sold by the price per dozen: $2 * 21.
