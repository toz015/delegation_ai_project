", "ost_step": {"1": "Let B represent the number of blue jelly beans. From condition 3, we know that the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans or 0.99B."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's assume the number of blue jelly beans is B. According to condition 3, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B. This means (1 - 0.01)B blue jelly beans and (1 + 0.01)B green jelly beans. Total jelly beans is 4500, so 0.99B + (1 + 0.01)B + B = 4500. Simplifying this equation results in 2.99B = 4500. Solving for B, B = 4500 / 2.99 = 1500. Since B represents the number of blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01(1500) = 1515. The number of red jelly beans is 0.99(1500) = 1485. The difference in the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30. The answer is: 30.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
