Can you tell me the value of X? However, looking at other problems, sometimes there might be assumed values, let's assume there are 17 students in his class. Let's continue under this assumption, because this isn't explicitly stated within your question.

However, we can solve this problem algebraically using our equation 3(2 + X). We already know that X equals 26 because the question says there are 25 classmates, but one additional person is included which is the teacher (which was not initially stated, but we see that 25 + 1 is indeed 26, including both the student count and the teacher mentioned later in this sentence) .
