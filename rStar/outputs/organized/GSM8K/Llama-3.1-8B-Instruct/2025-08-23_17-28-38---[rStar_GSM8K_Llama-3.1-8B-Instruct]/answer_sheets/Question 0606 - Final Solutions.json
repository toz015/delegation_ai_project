Based on the first condition, we know that for every 2 miles driven, the car's tires rotate 725 times. So for every 1 mile driven, the tires rotate 725/2 = 362.5 times. Since Jeremy drives his car 400 miles each month, the total number of rotations is 400 * 362.5 = 145,000 rotations. According to the third condition, each tire can handle up to 10,440,000 revolutions before needing replacement.

Question: For how many years will Jeremy's tires last before needing replacement?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we need to figure out how often the tires need to be replaced. Condition 2 says that Jeremy drives 400 miles per month. We don't know how long this corresponds to in terms of number of tire rotations because we don't know how many rotations occur per mile. Condition 1 tells us that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven. This means the tires rotate 362.5 times per mile (725 / 2). So if Jeremy drives 400 miles, the tires will rotate approximately 145000 times. Since the tires can only handle 10440000 rotations, they can be used 72000 times before needing to be replaced. Since the car rotates its tires 362.5 times per mile, and it takes 10440000 / 362.5 = 28760 miles to use up one set of tires, this means the tires will last 28760/400 = 72 months.
