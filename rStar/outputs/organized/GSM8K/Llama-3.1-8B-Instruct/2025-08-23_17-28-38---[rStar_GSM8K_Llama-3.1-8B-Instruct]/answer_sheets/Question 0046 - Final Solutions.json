Notice that x cancels out when you solve for the equation. Therefore, it is now 300-80= 220 = 23 (this is incorrect because we're trying to find the value of x). The correct way to do it is: She starts with 80, adds 'x', and ends up with 23. This means that the amount she buys minus the ones she used equals 23. She used 220, and that is simply her total. Therefore, we need to add the amount she had at the beginning, which is 80.

Our real goal here is to understand the meaning of 'total used,' which means 80+x+220. We've been told that this equals 300, and x represents the number of stickies she bought. This isn't true either. However, we are looking for the value of x, the number of stickies she bought. Therefore, if we represent 'total used' as 300+x, we should realize that 'total used' is actually 300+x, or rather 80+x+220, where 'total used' is the combination of stickers she bought ('x') plus the stickes she originally had ('80'). However, to determine the value of 'x', we must realize that Candice originally had 80 and bought some more. When she bought those stickys, the number she bought must equal the difference between what she had at the end and what she had at the begining and the ones she used for 220 cups. This makes sense because she has 23 sticky's left over. But to make an expression we can evaluate, let's consider the expression 80+x+220. We've established that 'total used' = 80+x+220. We've previously shown that this equals 300+x. However, since we know that 'total used'=300+x, we now have one equation with two variables: x and y.

However, at the end of it all, she ended up with only 23 post-it notes remaining. To put this into an equation, we get the following: 80 (original) + x (bought) - 23 (remaining) = 220 (used). Let's rearrange and solve this equation. We get: 80 + x - 23 = 220. Simplify this to: 57 + x = 220. Solving for x, we subtract 57 from both sides: 0 + x = 163. x = 163.

First let's figure out how many post-it notes Candice must have had initially before buying any additional ones. Let's call this unknown variable x. From condition 3, we can determine that the initial amount of post-it notes, plus the package Candice bought, minus the total number used should equal to the ending amount.
