To continue correctly, first, Zaid has $6000 as income. In step 1 of expenses, he pays $1500 in rent. In step 2 of expenses, he spends 1/3 of $6000 or $2000 on car fuel. This totals $3500 in expenses so far, leaving him with $6000 - $3500 = $2500. However, in the correction above, this remaining sum is incorrectly allocated to other steps without considering its actual remaining amount after donation. Correcting this now, Zaid has $6000 - $1500 in rent = $4500 left after step 2. After step 3, he spends another $2000 on car fuel. Subtracting this leaves him with $4500 - $2000 = $2500. In step 4, he donates half of the remaining $2500 to charity. Half of $2500 is $1250. So after donation, Zaid has $2500 - $1250 = $1250. Before any other expenses in step 5, he already had $2500. Considering his actual situation now in step 5, he hands over $200 and $700 to his family members. Thus, in step 5, he gives out $900 in total from the previously calculated $1250 available for distribution after the donation. His new balance becomes $1250 - $900 = $350.
