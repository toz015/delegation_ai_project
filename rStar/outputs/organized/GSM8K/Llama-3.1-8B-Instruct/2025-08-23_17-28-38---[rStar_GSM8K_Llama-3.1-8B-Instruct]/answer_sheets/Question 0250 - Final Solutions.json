To find out how many girls there are in total, add the number of girls from the two known classes (Condition 4 & 5). That is 15 + 12 = 27. But remember, schoolwide it's 50% girls, so this means 50% of the kids are girls. Since there are 3 classes, total number of students is 3*20 = 60. This means half of these are girls. So total number of girls is 60/2 = 30. We've already counted 27 of them, which leaves us with 30 - 27 = 3 girls not yet accounted for. This means the remaining girls are in Class 3.
