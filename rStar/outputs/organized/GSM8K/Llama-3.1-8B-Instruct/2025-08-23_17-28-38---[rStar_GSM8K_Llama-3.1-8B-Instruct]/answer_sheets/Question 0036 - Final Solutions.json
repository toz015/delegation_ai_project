Instead of saying \"$25000\" let's write it like this: twenty-five thousand dollars. It looks better that way. Now, the problem asks which of these two prices that Karen can afford to buy. That means we need to subtract twenty-five thousand from fifty thousand. Or we can simply say that twenty-five thousand is half of fifty thousand. Fifty thousand minus twenty-five thousand is thirty thousand. However, that doesn't tell us anything new. Let me simplify it again by thinking of it this way: Is twenty-five thousand dollars greater than or equal to forty-five thousand dollars? Of course not. Karen has only $5000. That's less than $25,000. A $35000 car is obviously too expensive for Karen. Therefore, she can only afford to buy a car that costs twenty-five thousand dollars.
