The speed required to cover the remaining distance of 6 miles in 1.5 hours is 6 / 1.5 = 4 miles per hour. However, since we know she averages 4 miles per hour overall but actually needs to get through the last 6 miles in just 1.5 hours (not 3), we calculate this separately because the question asks about the speed needed for those 6 miles. This situation is where we realize that our calculation might be flawed, the correct approach should involve dividing the specific length (6 miles) by the desired completion time (1.5 hours). Hence, the speed needed to walk the last 6 miles in 1.5 hours is 6 / 1.5 = 4 miles per hour. But wait, let's verify this isn't actually what's being asked here, or else I'm just answering the prior result; no, the real request is to verify this number: Given my own answer is incorrect (for the reasons stated above), we can try again using other logic paths: Let M equal the number of miles from point B to the end of the trail. At an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 10 miles, one would expect to spend M / 4 hours to finish the course. Since the actual time spent walking these miles must be greater than 1.5 hours due to increased difficulty, one could say it should take more time to finish the course, so M / 4 > 1.5. However, to solve for M specifically using different logic, look at your earlier answers for better results (see below): Question 5.1 tells us it would indeed take 3.5 hours. And we're looking at 4 miles/hour. You want me to redo 5.1 properly now, don't you? Fine. Given an average speed of 4mph, it would take 3.5 hours to complete the trail entirely. Given 4 mph for all trails, the equation for total distance covered is: Time = Distance / Speed, total = 24 / (Time = 36 = 2/3 * 36 = 24); this is wrong... Time = Distance / Rate.
