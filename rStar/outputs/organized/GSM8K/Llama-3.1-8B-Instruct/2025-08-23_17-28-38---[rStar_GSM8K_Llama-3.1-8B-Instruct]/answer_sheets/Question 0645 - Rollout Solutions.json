However, since the instructions were to follow a very specific format but the problem's setup may lead to confusion without clear steps of solution involving sums or operations on weights beyond recognizing the weight per portion, let's clarify the thought process might involve understanding portions but doesn't necessarily apply here due to misinterpretation or lack of detailed steps leading to the final weight calculation for three bags based on the original data.
