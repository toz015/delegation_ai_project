Let's consider condition 2 which seems most relevant here. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much money as Brad. Let's call Brad's amount 'x', meaning Jeff gets 4x. Since together they get all the 100 dollars, we can write the equation: x + 4x = 100. Combining like terms gives us 5x = 100. Solving for x means dividing both sides of the equation by 5 (because when you multiply something by 5, the only way to undo this is to divide by 5), which gives us x = 20. This tells us that Brad gets 20 dollars. Because Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets, we have 4 x 20 = 80 dollars. Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. This way, both Jeff and Brad will each receive 40 dollars, so the final answer would be: no, I am not supposed to say that. The answer is: 20. Brad.
