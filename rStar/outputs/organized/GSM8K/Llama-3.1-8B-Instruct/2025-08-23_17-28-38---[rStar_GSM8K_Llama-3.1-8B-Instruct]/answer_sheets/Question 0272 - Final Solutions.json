Let's first add the cost of all three items together. The cost of the cocoa was $4.20. The cost of laundry was $9.45. And the cost of pasta was $1.35. Adding those amounts together, we get: $4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65, then adding $1.35 we get $14.99 + $0.01 = $15.00. We can see that this calculation seems wrong as it appears that we made an error. However, let us continue and verify this amount using condition 2. According to condition 2, the total price for all the items adds up to $20. It actually looks like we just verified that our previous sum was incorrect because if you add $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35, you actually get $14.99 not $15. But what this means is, we're short about $5! Therefore, the correct sum is $14.99. When the mother pays with a $20 bill, the cashier will give back $5. The answer is: 5.
