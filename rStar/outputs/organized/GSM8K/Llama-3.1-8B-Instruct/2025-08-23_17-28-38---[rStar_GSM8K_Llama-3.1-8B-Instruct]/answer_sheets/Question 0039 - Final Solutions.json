Then r=4w and s=(1/2)r or s=r/2. We found out that walking speed should be determined differently. However, let us try to figure out the walking speed and check whether it works correctly with our current understanding. From question 5.1, we understand that r = 6 mph. We found out that r = 4w, therefore we get 6 = 4w. Solving the equation 6 = 4w, we obtain that w = 6/4 = 3/2 = 1.5 mph. Since we understood that s = r/2, then s = 6/(2) = 3. Now that we have established that r=6mph, w = 1.5 mph, and s = 3mph, we want to calculate the distance. Six hours contain one-third of running and two-thirds of walking. Therefore, we first calculate the distance for these activities separately. First, let\u2019s talk about running. She runs at 6 mph. As she runs for 2 hours, we multiply her speed and time of activity. Distance = Speed x Time. In this case, distance = 6*2 = 12. Next, let\u2019s calculate the distance she walked in 4 hours. Distance = Speed = 10 * 20 = (1/2) * 60 * 4 = (Speed) * (Time). In this case, distance = 1.5 * 4 = 6. Finally, we combine the distances traveled by Dana during her walking and running activities.
