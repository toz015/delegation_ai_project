Gene starts vacationing when he's 23. Since then, he stops vacationing when he is 34. That means we need to figure out how many years (or how many vacation blocks) have passed until he stopped vacationing at age 34. To find this, subtract his starting age (23) from his ending age (34). 34 - 23 = 11. This means he went on vacation 11 times or had 11 vacation blocks. But he only gets 4 vacation blocks per year, so we can divide the number of vacation blocks by the number of blocks per year. So 11 / 4 = 2 remainder 3. He could not make 3/4 of a block, but he could go on three full vacations and still use up two blocks in the last year before he stops going on vacation.

That means he has been vacationing for 11 years because he was 23 when he started. He goes on four vacations per year so he has done 4 x 11 = 44 vacations. However, this doesn't tell us what the problem wants. We only care about how many blocks he can make, which is equal to how many times he has gone on vacation. This is already 44. The answer is: 44. \n\nPlease note: Gene can actually never have used up every block. But Gene has enough vacation blocks to cover 7 years (4 per year). So we calculate that if you start at age 23 and stop at age 30, you get 7 * 4 = 28 blocks. Then you just need 8 blocks for age 31 and 32. This makes it a good idea to check that indeed 28 + 8 equals 36, as stated above. Therefore the total is 36.
