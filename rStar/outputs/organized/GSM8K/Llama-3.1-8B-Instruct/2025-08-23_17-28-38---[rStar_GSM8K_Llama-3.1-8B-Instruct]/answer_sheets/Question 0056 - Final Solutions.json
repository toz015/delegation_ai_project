It's 7 for the ticket and 7 for the popcorn, so it's 7 + 7 = 14 dollars per trip.\nNow that we know the cost of one trip to the movie, let's calculate how many trips he can afford with the money he has. To do that, we'll divide the total amount of money he has (42) by the cost per trip (14).\nSince we're dealing with a division, we can also solve this problem by asking ourselves how many groups of 14 fit into 42. We can rephrase this as a multiplication question: what number multiplied by 14 equals 42?\n42 divided by 14 is the same as finding what number multiplied by 14 equals 42. \nWhen we multiply 14 by 3, we get 42.
