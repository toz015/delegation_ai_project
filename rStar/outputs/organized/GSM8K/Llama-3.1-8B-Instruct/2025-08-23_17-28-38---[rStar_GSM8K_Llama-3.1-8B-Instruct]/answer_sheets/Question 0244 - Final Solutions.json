Griffin had 19 fries at this point. Before this we said Billy took 4 fries. We can add those 4 fries to Griffin's total of 19 fries and also add the number of fries that ginger gave him to see what his starting total was. When we add those two to 19, we get 23.  But since we're trying to solve for how many fries griffin got from ginger, we'll start over from the top and try to work backwards again. This time though, let's say that f is the unknown number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. f + 24 -5 - 4 - 2 = 13.  Then, the statement says that Griffin ended up with 27 fries. We can write another equation based on that information. f + 24 -5 - 4 - 2 = 27. However, our equation above was wrong, so instead we could use a simpler way. To make things easier, we know f + (24-5-4-2) ="}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's simplify the hint problem first. f + 13 = 27, because the total before adding fries from ginger would be 24 - 5 - 4 - 2 = 13. So if we add f + 13 to 27, then we'd have f + 13 + 14 = 41. If we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation, then we'd have f = 28. But that means ginger gave Griffin 28. I made a mistake earlier. Let me rework it. Let g be the number of french fries ginger gave Griffin. And since billy ate four french fries, and kyle ate five french fries, then c = k - 3, or c = 2. Then we know that g + (24 - 5 - 4 - 2) = 27. We know that 24 - 5 - 4 - 2 = 13. Therefore, the statement simplifies to g + 13 = 27. Then, we simply get g = 14.
