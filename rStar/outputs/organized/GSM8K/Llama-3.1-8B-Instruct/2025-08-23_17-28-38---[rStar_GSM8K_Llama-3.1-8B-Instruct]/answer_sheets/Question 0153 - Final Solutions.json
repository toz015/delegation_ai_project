Before any creature ate or took the pack, there were 5 fries left. Considering that the raccoon took two thirds of the previous amount of fries and ants carried off one, then two thirds of three, and finally the last one, that will be equal to five minus one, minus two thirds of two minus one, which would be two plus one third, but if we reverse the process and go back to the beginning to avoid confusion, and instead consider how many fries are left before each event happens starting backwards, we know that there were 5 fries left at some point, a raccoon ate two thirds, which we'll call r for now, an ant ate one, and another ant ate two thirds of two. We know that after these two ants finished, there were two fries left because there's no way two thirds of two plus two could be more than five. This also matches that the anteater ate two thirds of two (or one and a fraction), since 2 + (2*(2)/3) > 5, so 2 + 4/3 is actually more than 5 and should not be added, and since there are 2 left over, we're good to continue. There were two fries left before the raccoon ate, so the raccoon had eaten r. Since there were five fries before this event, and we subtracted 5 minus r equals 2. Solving for r, r is equal to three, however, we also must account for the fact that ants ate two thirds of two. In order to find r we add two to what's left over after raccoon eats 2/3 (since the number of fries is being reduced by the raccoon eating 2/3). But since this results in more than 5 again, we must reconsider our steps and approach this problem logically again.

A seagull ate half as much as Dave. Since Dave ate 14, the seagull ate half of that, which is (1/2) * 14 = 7. Therefore, 14 + 7 = 21 fries were eaten by humans and seagulls. Three pigeons ate 3 fries apiece. Since there were three pigeons, this means that 3 x 3 = 9 more fries were eaten. By the time the raccoon comes along, there are 21 + 9 = 30 fries left. The raccoon eats 2/3 of these, which is (2/3) * 30 = 20. But we need to find out how many were eaten by all animals prior to the raccoon.

Before the pigeons finished eating, there must have been 18 * (3 / 2), which simplifies to 27. These fries resulted from the actions of the seagull that took half the amount Dave had eaten.

This means that if the raccoon ate 2/3, the other 1/3 was left which equals 6. To find out how many there were before 3 pigeons ate, note that 6 is 1/3 of whatever was before them. Thus 6*(3)=18 fries were there before the pigeons. Before the pigeon, however, a seagull ate half of what Dave had eaten. That means that (18)*2=36 fries were present right before the pigeon, since 36 divided by 2 = 18. However, before the seagull ate half, Dave himself ate 14 fries.
