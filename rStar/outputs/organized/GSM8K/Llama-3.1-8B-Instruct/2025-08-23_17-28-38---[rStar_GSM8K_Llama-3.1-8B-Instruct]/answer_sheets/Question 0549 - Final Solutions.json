I am confused by this prompt because it appears we're discussing someone named James and the standard play set instead of Jonathan. To find out how many toys Jonathan has right now, we do know he wants 2 more toys than he currently has. So he currently has Y toys. He wants Y+2. But we also know something else, that James's standard play set has 400 toys (a fact we never use because it doesn't relate to anything). Since we can't directly find out how many toys Jonathan has, let's look closer at the hints given. One hint mentioned a formula for finding out how many toys are in James's standard play set using the other hint. That part seems irrelevant to us and Jonathan.
