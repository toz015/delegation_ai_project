First we need to find out how heavy Alex is. We know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, Alex weighs 4 * 125 - 2. This equals 500 - 2 = 498. So Alex weighs 498 pounds. To find the combined weight, you add their weights together: 125 + 498. That's 623. The answer is: 623.", "value": 1.0}}}, "rollout_id": 30}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.
