We know Lee runs 2 seconds less than Gerald, but we don't know their time. Let's call Gerald's original time G. Lee's time is G - 2. Because Gerald is 10% faster now, his new time is 0.9G. Since this is still faster than Lee, it means his original time was actually (G - 2) seconds slower.  So 0.9G > G-2. We need to find G. Multiply both sides by 100 to make things easier: 90G > 100G -200. Move all terms with G to one side, and constants to another: 90G - 100G > -200. This simplifies to -10G > -200. Divide both sides by -10: 1G < 20. Since we know that there will always be positive time, take just the positive part: G is less than 20. However, the problem asks us what is the original time of Gerald, so we cannot say it is less than 20; instead we should find out that if Gerald\u2019s new time is 10% faster than his old time, then let X represent Gerald\u2019s new time.
