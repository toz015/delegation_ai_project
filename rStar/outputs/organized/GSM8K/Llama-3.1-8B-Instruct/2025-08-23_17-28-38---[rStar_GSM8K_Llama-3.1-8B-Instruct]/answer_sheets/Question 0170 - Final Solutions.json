Next, let's add up all the individual prices of the uniform: the cost of the hat is $25, the cost of the jacket is $75, and the cost of the pants is $50. So the total cost is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

According to the problem statement, the hat costs $25. Condition 2 states that the jacket is exactly 3 times as expensive as the hat. This means the jacket costs 3 x 25 = 75. According to condition 3, the pants are the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average of two numbers can be found by adding them together and then dividing by 2. So we first add the hat cost ($25) and the jacket cost ($75), which equals $100. We divide this sum by 2 to find the cost of the pants. $100 / 2 = $50. To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants. So we add $25 (hat cost) and $75 (jacket cost) and $50 (pants cost). That makes $150.
