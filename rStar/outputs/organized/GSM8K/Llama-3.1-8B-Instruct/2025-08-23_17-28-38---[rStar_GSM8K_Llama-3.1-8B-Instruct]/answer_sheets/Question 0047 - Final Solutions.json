Each blue tie cost $40, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties. According to condition 2, he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, which means he bought 5*2 = 10 red ties. Condition 3 states that red ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties. This means the price of a red tie is 1.5 times the price of a blue tie, or $60 per red tie. Therefore, 10 red ties cost 60 * 10 = 600 dollars. To find the total amount John spent, we need to add the cost of the blue ties (200) and the cost of the red ties (600). Total spent = 200 + 600 = 800. The answer is: 800.", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
