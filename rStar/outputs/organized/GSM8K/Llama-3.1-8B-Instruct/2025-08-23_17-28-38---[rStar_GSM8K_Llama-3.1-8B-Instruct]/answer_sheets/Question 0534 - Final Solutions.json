So the girls brought 4 times 600 which equals 2400. Then, the girls also brought the same number of seashells that the boys brought which is 600. In total, the girls brought 2400 + 600 = 3000. Since there are 10 girls and the total number of shells they brought is 3000, each girl must have brought 3000 / 10 = 300.
