First, we need to find out how much the full-priced glasses cost. Let's call this 'x'. We know that 0.6x is 60% of the full price, but it is also the same as 5% of the full price. Since 100% is 100/100 or 1, 95% is 95/100 or 0.95. We can create an equation using this information. 0.6x is equal to 5/100 times x. This means that 0.6x = 0.05x. However, the problem states that 0.6x is 60% or 0.6 of the full price. Therefore, the price of all the glasses is actually x divided by 0.05 or 20.

The question stated that the 5% of the glasses cost 40% of $5, or 0.4(5). And if you look at the above formula it says that the regular price is 20, therefore the discount would be 0.04(20) or 0.8 which is the same thing 40% of $5 because 0.4(5) is 2, now since 2 plus 0.8 is 2.8, the cost per discount price would be 2.8/16, or 7/40 or 17.5 cents. The question asks what is the total amount kylar has to pay for the glasses. This includes both the regular priced glasses and the discount ones, since kylar buys 16 glasses, he needs to buy (5/100)(16) glasses at the lower price, or 16* (5/100) glasses at the higher price. So we can write the equation: 16 * .05 *2.8+16*.95*x= total cost. To solve for the total cost, first we simplify the first term of the equation. We do this by multiplying the numbers. (.05)(2.8)=.14 So the first term becomes 16*.14. Next, we can multiply 16 and .14 together to get 2.24. Then we add 2.24 to the product of 16 and 0.95x. Now our equation reads 2.24+16(.95)x=total cost. To continue solving, we need to isolate x. In order to do this, we move the constant to the other side of the equation. This leaves us with the equation 16(.95)x = Total Cost -2.24. Then we divide both sides by .95*16 to obtain the solution: x = (Total Cost -2.24)/.95*16. Substituting back in for total cost from equation (1), we get: x = ((16*.14)+16(.95)x -2.24)/.95*16. Next, we need to find a way to express .95x in terms of x.
