For the 80 spiders, each having 8 legs, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs per spider. This gives us 80 * 8 = 640 spider legs. Next, for the 90 insects, each having 6 legs, we also multiply the number of insects by the number of legs per insect. This gives us 90 * 6 = 540 insect legs. Finally, for the 3 mutant invertebrates, each having 10 legs, we again multiply the number of invertebrates by the number of legs per invertebrate. This gives us 3 * 10 = 30 invertebrate legs. To find the total number of legs, we simply add the number of legs for all three types of animals together: 640 (spider) + 540 (insect) + 30 (invertebrate) = 1210.
