There are 2 conditions related to collecting milk. We need to use condition 2 which states she collects 1kg of milk per day from half of the sheep. Half of 30 is 15. She collects 1kg of milk per day from this half. The answer is: 1.0. \n\nNote: This is a non-standard problem format where you're not following instructions and the math does not add up correctly. It seems like it's asking for volume of milk collected over time (per day). The question itself could benefit from additional clarification or context. However, based on what we can infer from the prompt, I provided the solution as instructed. Normally, a correct interpretation would depend on understanding how long we're considering Mary's daily collection of milk, since her collection appears to be ongoing. But without that information, we'll assume a one-day perspective here.  I followed your original request strictly but also included this note. Please ask me if you'd like further clarification.

Half of Mary's sheep produce 1 kg of milk per day, while the other half produce 2 kg of milk per day.

Therefore we can just calculate 1/2 of the amount of milk produced by the first half of the sheep and double it (since the second half produces twice as much). First we find out 1/2 of Mary's sheep. This is 30 / 2 = 15. We know that 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, so this means 15 kg of milk are produced by these sheep. The other half of the sheep produce twice as much milk.
