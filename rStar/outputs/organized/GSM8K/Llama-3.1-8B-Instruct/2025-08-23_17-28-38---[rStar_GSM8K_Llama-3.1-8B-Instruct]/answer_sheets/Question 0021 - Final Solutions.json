Let's reframe the condition. We already know that Samantha is now 31, and Raymond was 21 when she was 15. But when Raymond was 23, Samantha was actually younger. Therefore, we have Samantha being 17 when Raymond's child was born. The age difference between Samantha's current age and her birth year of Raymond's child will be calculated next.
