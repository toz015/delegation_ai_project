So we're looking for two-thirds of (h+7). To avoid getting mixed up, let's just remember the goal is to get (1/3)(h) and then add 7 to it. The other third would be ((1/3)*h)+((2/3)*(h+7))=h+(2/3)*7=h+14/3 which is not needed because it represents only one-third of the total depth of the water.

That means the water level on Wednesday is (2/3)*(h+7). But it doesn't affect the result because the h cancels out when you multiply it by 2/3. All that matters is the 7 and the fact that it gets multiplied by 2/3, leaving us with (2/3)*7=14/3*3=14, but we still don't have the value for h, which makes the formula still incomplete. This situation may seem unusual, but it works perfectly if you use algebraic manipulation instead of substituting values. The formula now becomes 2*(h/3 + 7/3)=2*h/3 + 14/3, and this still isn't enough to find the answer, because we still haven't found any way to express h, even though we've got an equation that shows how h and the numbers relate to one another. However, looking back at Question 5.1, it says \"We know that h + 7 is the height of the water on Tuesday.\" This means that the height of the water on Tuesday must equal h+7=17+7=24. And now we know h=17 (we figured that one out earlier), so we could replace it in our formula: 2*h/3 + 14/3. By plugging in h=17 we will obtain: 2*(17)/3 + 14/3 = 34/3 + 14/3 = 48/3 = 16 = 48 / 3 = 48 divided by 3 = 16.
