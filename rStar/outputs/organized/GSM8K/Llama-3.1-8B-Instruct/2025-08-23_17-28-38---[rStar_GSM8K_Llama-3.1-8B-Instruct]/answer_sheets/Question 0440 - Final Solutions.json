Since one side is given in yards, we need to convert it first. One side is 3 yards which is 3 * 3 = 9 feet. Hint given the length of one side, we can find other sides using area formula (area = length * width). Given that area is 360 sq ft and one side is 9 ft, another side must be 360 / 9 = 40. With both sides known (9ft and 40ft), we can find the perimeter which is 9 + 40 + 9 + 40 = 98ft. The answer is: 98.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
