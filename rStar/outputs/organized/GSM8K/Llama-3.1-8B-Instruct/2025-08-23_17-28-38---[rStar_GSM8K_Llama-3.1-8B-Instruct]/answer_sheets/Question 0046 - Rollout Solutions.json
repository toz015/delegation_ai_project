Candice originally had 80 Post-it notes. Then she bought another package, so we don't know how many she bought yet. Let's call it 'x'. We can add 80 and x together to find the total she has after buying the new pack of Post-its. Then she used 220 for the cups of coffee.  So all together, she used 80 + x + 220.

This question however, asks us only how many she used in total, not how many she had after buying a new pack, so let's first find how many she had after buying a new pack, then subtract the number of notes she originally had, and finally add the number of cups she wrote on. The problem statement does indeed say  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. But we still want to express it as an equation.

We know that 80 + x is equal to the amount of Post-it notes Candice has after purchasing the new package. When she gets home, she will have 80 + x - 220 + 23 left. Now our job is to isolate the variable x.  In other words, we must get x alone on one side of the equation. So what we will do is move every number except for x to the other side of the equation and solve the equation, or rather, cancel them out by adding the same values to both sides.  Let's start off by combining 80 and 23: (80 + 23) + x - 220 = 103 + x - 220. Next we'll combine 103 and -220: 103 + x - 220 = 103 - 220 + x, and 103 - 220 is equal to -117.  Therefore, our equation now looks like (-117) + x = (-117) + x. Since (-117) + x equals (-117) + x, we may remove (-117) from both sides of the equation without changing its value.
