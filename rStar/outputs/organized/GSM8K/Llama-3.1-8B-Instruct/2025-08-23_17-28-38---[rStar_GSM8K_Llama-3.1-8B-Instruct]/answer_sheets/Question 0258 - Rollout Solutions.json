First we need to find out the total amount Nancy owes. The fine for 8 books is .50 x 8 = 4 dollars. Adding the flat fee makes it 4 + 2 = 6 dollars. But we want the cost per book. Since there are 8 books, we divide 6 dollars by 8 books. This is 6 / 8. Dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (which is 2) gives us 3/4 dollars per book. However, since this isn't in the correct format, we can multiply the fraction by 100 to convert it into dollars and cents, and get 75/100 or 0.75 which we can simplify further and still keep the format.

Then we need to add the 2 dollar fee, so 4 + 2 = 6 dollars. But wait! It says the answer is 0.75. Since .75 is less than 1, it must be only the 50-cent charge. This means there were no overdue books, because if you have even just one overdue book, there would be a 2-dollar charge. But there are still 2 dollars from somewhere else in the question. Maybe the 0.75 comes from only the 50 cent per book fine? If that's the case, then we must have 0.75 / .5 = 1.5 books late. Since you can't return a fraction of a book, this must not be correct. Let's try again. There might be only one overdue book, which would be a 50-cent fine. So let's say one book is late. That would leave 7 books on time, so we don't have to count those.
