That means their profit of $25 came from selling each gallon for $10. Since they spent $5 making each gallon, they can calculate how much they made on each gallon by subtracting their cost from the price: $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon. This is consistent with the previous result since we also calculated their profit per gallon was $5. To find out how much they spent on lemons for all gallons, we divide their total profit ($25) by how much they made per gallon ($5). Therefore, we have: 25 / 5 = 5. \n\nTo answer which portion of the problem this is solving, this is solving how much money did they spend on lemons.
