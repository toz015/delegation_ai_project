Since downloads increased by 100%, then decreasing by 30% means we need to decrease by 70%. 180 / 10 (since 10/7 is 1.43) = 16.28 is not what we want. To decrease by 30%, we simply multiply 180 downloads by .7. .7(180)=126 downloads. Now let's add all the downloads together. We started with 60 downloads, then we multiplied it by 3 getting 180, then we multiplied 180 by .7 to get 126 downloads in the third month. 60+180+126=366 downloads.
