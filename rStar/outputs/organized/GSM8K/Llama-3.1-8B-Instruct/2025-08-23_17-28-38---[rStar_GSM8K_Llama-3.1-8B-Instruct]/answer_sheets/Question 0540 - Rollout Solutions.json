The eldest boy shares $18 with 2 other brothers, but this part does not affect him since he gets the entire initial $18. His initial amount was what we're trying to find out. Let's call it X. After getting $18 and adding $5 the next day, then adding $10 the day after, he would have $18 + $5 + $10 = $33. However, we're also told he saved up enough money to triple his remaining funds after taking $8 away, which means that if he starts with X and takes away $8, then triples that, he ends up with 3($X-$8). Since we know he ends up with $33 + whatever savings amount, let's write down what we already know about his money: $33 (from the first two days) + $y (whatever additional amount) = $33 + $y. We can say that $33 + $y represents the sum of any and all money he acquires beyond the first two days. He has $33 after the first two days, but before any additional savings (or whatever happens to occur), he would end up with $33 + $y.

But we know that when he took away $8 from his current total of $33, he ended up tripling what remained. So to calculate his original total ($x), let's set up an equation. First, subtracting $8 from $33 leaves $25. Since he tripled what was remaining, we multiply $25 by 3 to get $75. The equation looks like this: $x - $8 = $75. To solve for $x, add $8 to both sides of the equation, getting $x = $83. This means that before spending the $8, he had a total of $83. After spending the $8, he had $83 - $8 = $75.
