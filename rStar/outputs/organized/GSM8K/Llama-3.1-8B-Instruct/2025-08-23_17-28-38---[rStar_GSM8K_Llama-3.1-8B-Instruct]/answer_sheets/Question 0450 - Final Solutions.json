If Jason saves $2 by buying the super ticket (instead of regular) then that means that the amount he paid more for the super ticket ($8) minus the amount he saved ($2) is the price of the free popcorn.

As we've determined the value of the super ticket to be at least 16 dollars by subtracting its cost from the other option's known cost, meaning your normal ticket cost would be $22. You would still be missing 4 dollars to match the total savings provided by the super ticket. Thus, you need to calculate how much that 4 dollars is made up of. The 4 dollars is comprised of one serving of popcorn (which we're looking for) and a bottle of soda (costing $3). The equation to figure out the cost of popcorn is $4 - Soda Price = Popcorn Price, where we've learned the soda price is 3 dollars.
