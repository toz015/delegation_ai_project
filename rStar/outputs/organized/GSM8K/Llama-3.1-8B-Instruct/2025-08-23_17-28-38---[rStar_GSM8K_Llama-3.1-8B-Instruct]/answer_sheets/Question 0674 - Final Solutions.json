First we need to calculate how long it took for the bamboo to get to 500 inches because it is easier to calculate. The bamboo starts at 240 inches. To go up to 500 inches, it needs to gain 260 inches. Since it grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, this would take 260 / 30 = 26/3 days or approximately 8.67 days to get to 500 inches. Next, we need to calculate how long it takes to go the remaining 100 inches. Using the same logic as before, since 100 inches is gained at 30 inches/day, it will take 100 / 30 = 10/3 days or approximately 3.33 days to reach 600 inches. Adding the time it takes to get to 500 inches (8.67) and the additional time it takes to get to 600 inches (3.33), we get 8.67 + 3.33 = 12 days.
