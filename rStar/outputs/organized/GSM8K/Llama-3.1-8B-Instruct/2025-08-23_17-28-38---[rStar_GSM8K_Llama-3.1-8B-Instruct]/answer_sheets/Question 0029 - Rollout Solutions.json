We are asked to find the value of h. To do so, rearrange the equation to isolate h. This would give us h = b + 5. But we know nothing about the price of the boots. Luckily, we know that Gloria will buy one of them. That means that the price of the heels (h) plus five dollars equals the price of the boots. If h + 5 = b, then the opposite also holds true. It doesn't matter if you add 5 to h and call it b or subtract 5 from b and call it h. They are equal. Therefore, we can say that the price of the heels, h, minus 5 equals the price of the boots minus 5.
