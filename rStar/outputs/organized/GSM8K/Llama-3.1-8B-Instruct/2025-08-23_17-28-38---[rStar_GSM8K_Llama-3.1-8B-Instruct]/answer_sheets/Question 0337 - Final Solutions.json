However, according to this solution, the total distance should be 23=5+8+x, x being the distance traveled after the third turn. That means, according to this problem, the distance traveled after the third turn should be 23-13=10 meters.  Question 4 should have a different answer. The correct answer is not 10 but rather 3 meters. Question 5 doesn't follow the required format. Question 7 was missing. I will review other questions following the same format.  Question 6 is also missing. Here is question 6 and its answers. Question 6: There are five boxes, one containing apples, one bananas, one grapes, one oranges, and one pears. Each box contains exactly 10 items. One day, the contents of two boxes were switched. Which boxes could have been switched? Question 6.1: How many fruits are in each box if all boxes contain exactly ten fruits? Answer 6.1: Since there are five types of fruits (apples, bananas, grapes, oranges, pears), each box must contain exactly ten fruits. Thus, the answer is no additional information about how many fruits are contained in each box can be determined from this question. However, we know that the five boxes are labeled differently. The answer is unknown. Question 6.2: Now we can answer the question: Which boxes could have been switched? Answer 6.2: We cannot determine which specific two boxes were switched based on the available information. Therefore, any combination of two different boxes could have been switched. Some possible combinations include switching the apple and banana boxes, or the grape and orange boxes, etc. The answer is unknown. Question 7: A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They make a profit of $0.25 per loaf. If they work 365 days per year, what is their yearly profit? Question 7.1: How many loaves of bread do they sell in a year? Answer 7.1: They sell 250 loaves of bread per day. Over the course of 365 days, they would sell 250 * 365 = 91250 loaves of bread.
