We don't know the initial height of the water, but we can calculate its depth based on the problem statement. Let's call the initial height of the water h. We know that h + 7 is the height of the water on Tuesday. However, this part of the question doesn't make sense as the height can't depend on another variable (like the initial height), so let's ignore it and move to Wednesday. The water level on Wednesday is two-thirds of the water level on Tuesday, which is 7 feet more than Monday. We don't need to find the initial height because it doesn't matter for our final answer, since we already have the information needed to solve for the water level on Wednesday. So we're looking for two-thirds of (h+7). To avoid getting mixed up, let's just remember the goal is to get (1/3)(h) and then add 7 to it. The other third would be ((1/3)*h)+((2/3)*(h+7))=h+(2/3)*7=h+14/3 which is not needed because it represents only one-third of the total depth of the water.
