{"id": 452, "problem": "A car is on a road trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.\nThe car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.\nIt drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.\nLet S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.\nThen we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
