This increased the value of his house by $40,000. Thus, the new total value of his house is $80,000 (initial) + $40,000 (increase) = $120,000. Since he spent $50,000 on repairs, he effectively paid $80,000 ($120,000 - $50,000) for the original house. Then he sold it for $120,000. The final sale price exceeds the initial cost for Josh by $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000. The answer is 40000.", "value": 0.53125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
