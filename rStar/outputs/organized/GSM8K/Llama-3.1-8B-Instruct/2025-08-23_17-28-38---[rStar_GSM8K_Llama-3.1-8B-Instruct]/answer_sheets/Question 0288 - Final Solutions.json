Since you can't split a truck load into fractions, that means that every truck can only take 26 flagstones. However, we need to move 80 flagstones. 80 / 26 is 3 with remainder 4. Since every truck takes 26, we'll have to make 3 trips. So the answer is 3.

This results in 3000 / 2000 = 3 trips. However, the question asks about a single trip, not multiple trips. The wording may suggest multiple trips but since it says \"single trip\", it implies the question actually wants to know if a single trip is sufficient or if a second trip is also necessary due to capacity constraints. In either case, the calculation still applies. Since you cannot break down a single trip further into fractional parts or take multiple vehicles that exceed capacity on a single run, we interpret the question to mean simply if any flagstones would remain. If 80 stones, then 3000 pounds, and we can only fit 2000 pounds in a truck, then yes, some stones would need an additional run.
