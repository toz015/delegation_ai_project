How much money does he have left? Question 6.1: How much money does Tom spend to give back to his community? Answer 6.1: 1/6 of $200 is equal to 200 * (1/6) = 33.333. However, you cannot pay with 1/3 dollar or other fractional dollars in real life. So let us treat this number as 33.33. The answer is 33.33. Question 6.2: Now we can answer the question: How much money does he have left? Answer 6.2: First, we calculate how much money Tom spent to give back to his community, which is $33.33. Next, we take the difference between the original cost ($200) and what he gave back ($33.33), which is 200 - 33.33 = 166.67. Tom just spent 40 dollars on the shirt. Subtracting that from the result, 166.67 - 40 = 126.67. The answer is 126.67. Question 7: There is a 45-degree angle in a triangle, and one side length is 16 units long. Find the area of the triangle. Question 7.1: What kind of triangle has a 45-degree angle? Answer 7.1: It's a right triangle with a 45-45-90 configuration because one of its angles is 45 degrees. In such triangles, the two legs are always equal and the hypotenuse is 1 unit larger than either leg. The answer is a right triangle. Question 7.2: Now we can answer the question: What is the length of the second leg of the triangle? Answer 7.2: Given the information above about a 45-45-90 triangle, we know the two legs are equal.
