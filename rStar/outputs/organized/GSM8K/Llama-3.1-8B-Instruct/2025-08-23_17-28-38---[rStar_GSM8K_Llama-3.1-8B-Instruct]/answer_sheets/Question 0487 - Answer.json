{"id": 487, "problem": "Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse can consume five pounds of oats per meal. He feeds his horses twice a day. If one bag contains 50-pounds of oats,  how many bags of oats does he need to fed his horses for five days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.\nThus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.\nSo, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.\nTherefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.\n#### 4", "gold_answer": "4"}
