We don't know how many trees Harry or Ferdinand have yet, but we can figure it out. We know that Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Let F equal the number of trees Ferdinand has. This means H=2F+5. Since we also know that H+C=11, we can plug H into this equation to get 2F+5+6=F. Solving for F gives us 17/3=F*3/3, so F=17/3, but since you requested a number and not a fraction, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 3. Multiplying both sides by three yields F=51/9. The question states you want the number of trees, and not the numerator. Therefore, if we divide 51 by 9, we obtain our solution as follows: F=51/9 = 5.6667, which was rounded to four decimal places.
