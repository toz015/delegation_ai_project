Condition 1 tells us that 1 child ticket costs $10, and 1 adult ticket costs $12. We know that together they cost $22. Condition 2 says Brittany's mom paid for them, so we don't need to find out who paid for which ticket. Condition 3 says that Brittany's mom received $8 back as change. This means she gave the cashier 8 more than what it cost, or 22 + 8 = 30. The answer is: 30.
