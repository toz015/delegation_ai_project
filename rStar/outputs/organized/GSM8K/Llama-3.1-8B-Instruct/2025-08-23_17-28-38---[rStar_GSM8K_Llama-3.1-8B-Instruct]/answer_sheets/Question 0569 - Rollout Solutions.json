First, we need to calculate how much money Mitchell made, which is not what the question asks but it is necessary information. Mitchell made 21 dollars from selling lemonades. But since we know he made this amount from selling 21 lemons at 4 dollars each, we can find out how much more he made compared to Liam by finding the difference in their earnings. 21 * 4 = 84 (Mitchell's earnings). 63 (Liam's earnings) - 84 (Mitchell's earnings) = -21, so Mitchell made less than Liam but 21 was incorrect because I did not read the prompt correctly. So let me re read it again. The correct answer is 21 dollars per lemonade x 21 lemons, which equals 441. This means mitchell earned $441. To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made than Liam, we simply subtract the amount liam made from the amount Mitchell made: 441 - 63 = 378.
