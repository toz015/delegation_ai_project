To make one dozen croissants, you need 1/4 lb of butter. One dozen equals 12. So you need (1/4) / 12 pounds of butter per croissant. First, we'll simplify 1/4 divided by 12.

This means Juan makes 12 croissants every time he uses 1/4 lb of butter. Since he starts off wanting to make 4 dozen (12 * 4 = 48) croissants per day, we simply divide this amount by 12 croissants made per 1/4 lb of butter. 48 divided by 12 equals 4.
