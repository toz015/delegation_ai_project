", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, calculate the original costs. There are 2 types of boards. The first one costs $10 per board but it increases by 50%. To find the new price, we need to add half of the old price. Half of 10 is 5 so the new price is 10 + 5 = 15. The second type of board costs $16 per board and also increases by 50%. Half of 16 is 8 so the new price is 16 + 8 = 24. Then, let's multiply the quantities of these types of boards together with the price they were sold at: (10 x 15) + (5 x 24). Multiplying them gives us (150) + (120). Adding this gives 270. The answer is: 270. \nWe must note that this is not the question being asked, as it asks about profit, not revenue.
