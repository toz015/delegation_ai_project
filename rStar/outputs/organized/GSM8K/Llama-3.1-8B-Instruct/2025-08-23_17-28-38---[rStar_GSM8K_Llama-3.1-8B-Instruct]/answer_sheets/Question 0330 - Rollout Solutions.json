First we need to calculate the rewards they earned. Since they earned a dollar off for every twenty spent, and they previously spent eighty dollars, we can divide 80 by 20 to get 4. But since you earn a dollar off for every twenty, not every twenty is worth one dollar off, but rather every twenty is worth one dollar off, so it is correct. Next, we need to multiply this by one dollar because that is how much they earn per twenty. One dollar times four is four. However, we know that rewards are equal to one half of twenty times four. That makes one half of eighty, which is forty. We know that they also earned a coupon, and coupons reduce the price by twice as much as the rewards. We know that the rewards were forty, so if you double forty, you get eighty, which is two times forty. Rewards and coupons together resulted in 40 + 80 = 120 dollars in savings.
