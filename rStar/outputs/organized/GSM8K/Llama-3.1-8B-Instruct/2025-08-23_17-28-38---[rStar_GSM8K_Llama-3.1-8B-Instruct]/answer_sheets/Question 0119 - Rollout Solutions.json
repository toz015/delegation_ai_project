This makes sense because if Adrien's salary is 130% of Lylah's, Adrien's salary will always be greater than Lylah's. \nSo, Adrien's initial salary in percentage terms of Lylah's is 130%, i.e., 1.3 times Lylah's.\nNow, we find out their salaries after 4 years. Adrien's salary increases by 40%. This means he gets paid 140% of the amount he used to get paid before. Since he used to get paid 130% of Lylah's, this is equivalent to getting paid 1.4 * 1.3 = 1.82 times Lylah's salary four years prior. \nWe know the current salary of Adrien, which is $40000 * 1.4 = 56000.

This was also 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time. To find out Lylah's original salary (let it be represented as 'L' ), we use the equation: 1.3L = 40000. Then solve for 'L': L = 40000 / 1.3 = 30769. After that, calculate their salaries after 4 years using the information provided. For Adrien: His past salary is $40000 and there was an increase of 40%. So his current salary is $40000 * 1.4 = $56000. For Lylah, if we let her original salary be L, then her current salary would be 1.3 * L = 1.3 * 30769 = 39962.

Four years ago, Adrien made 40,000 dollars. Since his salary increased 40%, then it increased by 0.4 times 40,000 which is 16,000 dollars. This means four years ago Adrien's salary was 40,000 plus 16,000. That equals 56,000. Since Adrien made 56,000 dollars four years ago, this also represents 140% of what Lylah made four years ago. To find out how much Lylah made 4 years ago we can first divide 56,000 by 1.4, or .14. This results in Lylah making 40,000 dollars four years ago. However, since both of their salaries increased by 40%, Lylah would make 40,000 * 1.4, or 56,000 four years later. And Adrien would be making 56,000 + (56,000 * 0.4) which is equal to 56,000 + 22,400. Therefore Adrien would be making 78,400. 56,000 + 78,400 equals 134,400.
