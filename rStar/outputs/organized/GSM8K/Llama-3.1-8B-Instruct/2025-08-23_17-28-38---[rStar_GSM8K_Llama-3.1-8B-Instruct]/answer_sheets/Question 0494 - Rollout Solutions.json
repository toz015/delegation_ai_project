Each of those 4 girls are standing on the shoulders of the one below them, so they must be taller than just adding 64 inches by 4. Let's calculate how much all 9 cheerleaders add up to first. They are 64 inches tall but only represent 90% of the group. That means 64 x .9 = 57.6. So all 9 of them together add up to 9 x 57.6 = 518.4 inches. Next, if you were to put them in order from shortest to tallest (with the 10th person being 60) and you stacked them like this: (shortest+second-shortest), second-tallest-third-tallest, then fourth-tallest-fifth-tallest, and lastly sixth- seventh-tallest-eighth-tallest-ninth-tallest-and-the-tallest-on-top, then you would see the following stack: 60(0.6), 57.6(0.576), 57.6(0.576), 60+57.6=117.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64\" tall.

From condition 1 we know 9 out of the 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall. From condition 2, we know the remaining cheerleader is 60 inches tall. We need to find the height of the tallest cheerleader. Let's call her height h. Given 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we calculate the collective height as 9h + 60. To get the average height, divide this collective height by 10: (9h + 60) / 10. For this to equal 64 (the known average), solve for h. (9h + 60) / 10 = 64. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate division: 9h + 60 = 640. Subtract 60 from both sides to isolate terms containing h: 9h = 580. Divide both sides by 9 to isolate h: h = 64.52.
