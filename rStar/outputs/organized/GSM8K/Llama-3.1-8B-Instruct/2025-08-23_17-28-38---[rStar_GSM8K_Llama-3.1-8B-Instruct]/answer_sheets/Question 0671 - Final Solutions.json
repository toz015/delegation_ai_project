The question was asking what amount of money Adam received as change, which is not directly calculated because we need to know how much change he received when buying the candies to calculate it. However, considering that the original problem statement says he paid $11 and the problem asks how much money did Adam receive as change when he paid $15, the change he would get back is simply $15 - $11 = $4. But since the hint states we should find the amount he received as change, and you mentioned it as \"$11\", I assume the actual question might have been asked differently or there might have been a misunderstanding. In any case, if we're following the original instruction to provide a final numeric answer in the specific requested format, according to your calculation, it seems there was confusion about what was being asked. Given your calculation of the cost, if we understand the task correctly now, it means the total spent was $11, but the prompt actually seems to ask us to calculate the change from paying $15 after clarifying the context.
