Let's break this down into steps: \n- First, we need to calculate the price after a 50% increase from its original price of $8.

We take our current price of $12 and multiply by .75 (representing a 100% base minus a 25% decrease). This gives us 12 x .75 = 9.\nSo the stock price went from $8 to $12 during the first year, and from $12 to $9 during the second year. Thus, after one full year of ownership, the value of the shares would be 9 dollars per share.

First, we need to calculate the value after the 50% increase during the first year. A 50% increase means the new price is 100% (the original price) plus 50%, or 150% of the original. Thus, 150% of 8 dollars is 1.5 times 8 dollars, or 12 dollars. Since Maria owns 8 shares, the increased price will apply to all of them. Therefore, the total value of the shares will be 8 shares multiplied by 12 dollars per share, which is 96 dollars. Next, we consider the drop in the second year. This time, the price will decrease by 25%, meaning it will be 75% of the previous price.
