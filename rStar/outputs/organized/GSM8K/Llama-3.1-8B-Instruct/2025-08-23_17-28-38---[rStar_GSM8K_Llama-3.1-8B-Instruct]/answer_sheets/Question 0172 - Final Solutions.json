So Granny Red is 16 years old. Condition 3 says that Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red. 16 + 3 is 19. So Sally Two is 19 years old. We don't need to know Sally Thirty-two's age since we already know everyone else's ages. The total age would be Sally Two plus Sally Four plus Granny Red which equals 19 + 8 + 16 = 43.

We already know Sally Four is 8. And since Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, then Granny Red is 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Now we don't know how old Sally Two or Sally Thirty-two are yet. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red. So Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19. We still can't find Sally Thirty-two's age without knowing one more piece of information. But actually, Sally Thirty-two is not mentioned. It seems like it was supposed to be Sally Three. Sally Three is 3 years older than Sally Two, so Sally Three is 19 + 3 = 22.
