There were 11 tadpoles originally. 7 of them showed up because they went under the rock. But we want to find out which ones came out from under the lily pad. We don't know about the original number of tadpoles under the lily pad. Let's call it x. Since 7 came out from under the rock and 11 was the original, there were x+7=11 tadpoles before 6 came out from under the lily pad. To find out how many tadpoles were originally under the lily pad, solve the equation x+7=11 for x: x=11-7=x=4. Because there were 4 tadpoles under the lily pad originally, that means there were 4 + 6 = 10 tadpoles that came out from under the lily pad.

However, we don't want just the ones not hiding under the rock, but also those newly showing up from the other hiding spot. Let's use variables to figure out how many tadpoles were under the lily pad to start. We can say x is the number of tadpoles already under the lily pad. 7 tadpoles came out from the one under the rock (not relevant here), but since there were only 11 in the first place, then there must have been 4 under the lily pad (the difference).
