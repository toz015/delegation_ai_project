Since the trip is 60 miles long, we can find out how far it is from the start to the end by subtracting the remaining 15 miles from the length of the trip. So the distance traveled so far is 60 - 15 = 45 miles. Next, we can subtract this 20 miles from 45. This means that there were 25 miles traveled after stopping and before stopping again, which also means that these 20 miles were traveled before stopping. To answer the problem, we simply need to figure out what distance separates Henry's first stop from his second stop. Given that Henry cycled 20 miles to get to his first stop, he still needed to cycle another 25 miles (60 - 35) to reach his destination. Because there are no other stops besides these two, this 25 mile stretch can't contain any other stops, meaning that it was cycled solely between the first and second stops.
