We know that Tom sailed for 3 hours at 10 mph. That distance can be found using the formula d = rt (distance equals rate times time). Plugging in r = 10 and t = 3, we get d = 10*3=30. Since the speed going back is 6, and the distance remains the same, we can use the formula t=d/r to find the time taken to go back. We plug in d = 30 and r = 6 into this formula, and we get t=30/6=5.
