To calculate the amount of stuffing for a collie bed, we find the average of the amount of stuffing required for a rottweiler bed (8 lbs) and a chihuahua bed (2 lbs). This is found by adding these amounts and dividing by 2. (8 + 2)/2 = 10/2 = 5 lbs per bed. We multiply this by 3 because there are three collie beds: 3 * 5 = 15. Adding the pounds needed for the four chihuahua beds (4 * 2 = 8) and the three collie beds (3 * 5 = 15), we get a total of 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.
