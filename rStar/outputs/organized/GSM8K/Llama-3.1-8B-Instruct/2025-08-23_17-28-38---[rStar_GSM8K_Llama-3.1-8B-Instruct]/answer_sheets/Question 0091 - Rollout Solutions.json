Because it says that they all have the same amount of pets, then it could equal c + (c + 2) + 3(c+2). This simplifies to 7c + 8. Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get 4c + 8 = 7c + 8.

We first solved for Marcia's pets, then for Jan's pets, and finally added all their pets together to get the total.
