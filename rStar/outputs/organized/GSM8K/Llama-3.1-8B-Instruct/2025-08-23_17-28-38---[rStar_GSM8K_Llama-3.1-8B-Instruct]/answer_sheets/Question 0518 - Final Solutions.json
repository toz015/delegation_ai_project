Ali saved 4 * 10 = 40 dollars from ten dollar bills and 6 * 20 = 120 dollars from twenty dollar bills. So in total he saved 160 dollars. He shared half of it with his sister. Half of 160 is 80. So now Ali has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. He spent 3/5 of this on dinner. To find out how much he spent, we need to calculate 3/5 of 80 which is (3 * 80) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48. Now we know he spent 48 dollars on dinner, so he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.

According to Condition 1, Ali saved 4 * 10 + 6 * 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 dollars. According to Condition 2, Ali gave 1/2 of it to his sister so he had 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. According to Condition 3, he spent 3/5 of this remaining sum. That would be (3/5) * 80 dollars. To calculate this product we multiply 80 by 3 and divide by 5 which is equal to (80*3)/5 = 240/5 = 48 dollars. We subtract 48 dollars from the remaining sum of 80 dollars.
