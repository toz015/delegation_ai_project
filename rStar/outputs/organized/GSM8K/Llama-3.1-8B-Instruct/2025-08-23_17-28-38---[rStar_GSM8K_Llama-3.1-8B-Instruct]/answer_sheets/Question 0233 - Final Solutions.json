Condition 1: 36 penguins start sunbathing on the snow. Condition 2: One-third of the penguins decide to jump into the ocean. Condition 3: Another one-third head into the cave to eat their dinner. Question: How many penguins continue sunbathing on the snow?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine how many penguins decided to jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the penguins jumped in, we need to divide 36 (total penguins) by 3 to get the result."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. There were 36 penguins initially. One-third decided to jump into the ocean, so we divide 36 by 3 to find out how many did that. 36 / 3 is 12. Another third went to the cave, which also equals 12 penguins. So, those two groups together equal 12 + 12 = 24. That means 36 - 24 = 12 penguins continued sunbathing on the snow. The answer is: 12.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Initially, there were 36 penguins. 1/3 of them decided to leave so that is (1/3) * 36 = 12 penguins. The remaining penguins who didn't leave are 36 - 12 = 24. But we also know another 1/3 headed into the cave. This means only half of the original number stayed behind, so it doesn't matter if 1/3 or 2/3 went to the cave - they both add up to a total of 12 leaving penguins, which we already calculated as 12.
