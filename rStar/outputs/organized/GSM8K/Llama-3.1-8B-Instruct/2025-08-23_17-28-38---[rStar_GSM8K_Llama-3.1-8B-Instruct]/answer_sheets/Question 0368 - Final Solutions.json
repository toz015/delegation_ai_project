Sara scores 8. We know that Erin has three times as many points as Sara. That means, 3(Sara's points) = 14 points. Since Sara scores 8, 3(8) = 24. This means that Erin has 24 points before she scored the last 14 points. The answer is 24 - 14 = 10. The answer is 10. Question 5.1 is actually irrelevant to solving the question. The relevant information is Erin has three times as many points as Sara and Erin has 14 points currently. So let's recalculate Sara's points from the original statement. Given Erin's current points, 3*Sara's points=Erin's current points, 3*Sara's points=14, Sara's points = 14/3. Since Sara can't have fractional points, this approach leads to incorrect solution. Instead, let's first determine Sara's points. Since Erin has three times as many points as Sara, let's denote Sara's points as S. Then 3S = 14. So S = 14/3 which is incorrect because Sara must have a whole number of points.  The actual process: 3 * (Sara's points)=14, where 3 times as much as Sara 3 points=4.66666 is not a whole number. So Sara's points is not possible 14 = 3x. To solve for x, divide both sides of this equation by 3, so x=14/3, which is not a whole number. Thus Sara could not have scored 8. There may be something wrong with these questions or the answers I am providing are wrong. Let me analyze again. Erin has 14 points. 3 times as many as Sara. To calculate Sara's points we use this formula 3*Sara's points = 14. The final answer should be a whole number, but what I have obtained so far 14/3 = 4.6666... is not a whole number. So Sara can not have 8 points. In other words, I need to recheck my assumption: Erin has three times more points than Sara. This assumption might not hold. Maybe I should rethink this problem and see why this formula doesn't hold. In the meantime, let's rephrase the problem in simpler terms: Erin has three times as many points as Sara, meaning Sara has one third of Erin's points.

This suggests that something about this problem is wrong. Since we can't solve it any other way, let's look at what it says. It doesn't say that the 3 times more comes after. Maybe it means that the 3 times more is just true without time involved. That makes sense because otherwise we'd get a very different answer. So X / 3 = 8. Therefore, X = 8 * 3 = 24.

But since Sara's score must be a whole number (you can't have half a point), we should check the problem again. Maybe Sara's score isn't supposed to be divided. Condition 2 actually means Erin's score is 3 times Sara's score plus Sara's score (or simply 4 times Sara's score). In other words, 4*S = 14. This means S = 14/4 or S = 7/2 or S = 3.5.
