We use the hint given by you which says \"According to the problem, Kylie collected twice as many shells on Tuesday as she did on Monday.\" to solve this problem. Let us assume that Kylie collected 'x' shells on Monday. It is also stated that Kylie collected 2 times as many shells on Tuesday than what she collected on Monday. Hence, on Tuesday, she collected '2x' shells. We are told that on Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Since it was mentioned that Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, we can write an equation to find out 'x'. The equation would be x = 20 + 5 (As Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert). Solving this equation, we get x = 25. This means that Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday. Now, since Kylie collected 2 times as many shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday, we can say that Kylie collected 2*25 = 50 shells on Tuesday. The answer is indeed 50.
