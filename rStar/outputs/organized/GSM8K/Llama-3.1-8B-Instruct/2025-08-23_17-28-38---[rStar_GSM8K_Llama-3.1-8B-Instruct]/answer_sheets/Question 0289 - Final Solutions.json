First, we know the car in the fast lane took 8 hours to get to 480 miles because 480 / 60 = 8. Next, since the slow lane car traveled at half the speed of the fast-lane car, its speed was 60 / 2 = 30. Finally, if the fast-lane car took 8 hours, then the slow-lane car would take twice that time because it is moving half as fast, making it 8 * 2 = 16 hours.
