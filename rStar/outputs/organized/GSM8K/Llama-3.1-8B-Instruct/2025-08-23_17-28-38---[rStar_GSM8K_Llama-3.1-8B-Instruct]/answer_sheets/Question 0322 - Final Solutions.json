This pencil belongs to Jam, so we do not count it in our boxes. The answer is 3. Note: the previous answer contained an error regarding the calculation for Jam's total pencils. The correct calculation yields that Jam indeed has 25 pencils. In fact, the correct calculation is that Jam has 3 boxes with some unknown quantity of pencils inside the boxes, plus 2 loose pencils. We know that these three boxes contain 24 pencils total. Thus the other statement made in Q5.1 about adding the 2 loose pencils to get 26 total pencils is incorrect. Instead, what we really know is that the value in the boxes is 24, and then add 2. Since Jam has three boxes, let us just assume the quantity of pencils in the boxes is x. Then, x+2=24+2=26. So, to find out how many pencils each box can hold, divide both sides of the equation x+2=24+2 by 3 (since she has 3 boxes), giving you x/3 + 2/3 = 26/3.

To get the number of boxes needed for both Jam and Meg together, add up the total number of pencils they own, which is 26 + 46 = 72. The pencils fit into boxes of 8, so divide 72 by 8. 72 / 8 is 9. The answer is: 9.  They will need 9 boxes.  I used division to find this answer. 9 boxes will hold 72 pencils because 9 x 8 is 72. Therefore, this answer makes sense in context.  There isn't another possible answer here. 9 is correct.

In order to find out how many boxes she and Meg will need together, first calculate how many boxes they would need if each of Meg's pencils were boxed separately. To do that, divide the total number of Meg's pencils (which is 46) by the number of pencils per box (which is 8). The result is 46/8 = 5.75. Because you cannot put only part of a pencil into a box, we round up this value to ensure we don't fall short.
