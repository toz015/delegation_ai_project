The hotel stay costs normally 1500 dollars per day. They stayed for 3 days. So the normal cost would be 1500 * 3 = 4500. But it was 20% more expensive so we need to add 20% of 4500 to get the actual cost. To calculate 20%, multiply 4500 by .2 which equals 900. Add this 900 to the original price of 4500 to get the final cost of 5400. Plane tickets cost 5000 dollars each and Tom bought 2, so the tickets alone cost him 5000 * 2 = 10000 dollars. The entire trip cost him 5400 + 10000 dollars.
