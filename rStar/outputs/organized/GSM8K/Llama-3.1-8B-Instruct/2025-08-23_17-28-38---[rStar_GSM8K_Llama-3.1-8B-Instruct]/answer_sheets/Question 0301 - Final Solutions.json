However, since we can't cut the original sheet into more than two until after the first fold, and considering that our end result only needs to be able to be manipulated into 16 individual pages, let's take a different approach. According to the hint, it requires three sheets to create a 16-page sheet (a 16-page sheet is essentially made up of two cover pages and 14 inner pages arranged as 4 two-pagers). It doesn\u2019t matter what size the initial sheet was because no matter how large or small it is, it always results in the same thing \u2013 16 unique pieces of paper per every initial sheet used when making a standard 16-page newspaper.
