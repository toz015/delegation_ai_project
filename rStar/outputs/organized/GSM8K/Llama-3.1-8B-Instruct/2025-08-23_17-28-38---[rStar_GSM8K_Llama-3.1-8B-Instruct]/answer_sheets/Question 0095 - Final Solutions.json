Finally, find the number of girls who are in the Girl Scout by finding 2/3 of the number of girls. We can find this by multiplying 2/3 and 120. Multiplying a fraction by a whole number is like solving 2x120/3. First, multiply 2 and 120 together which equals 240. Then divide 240 by 3 which equals 80. Therefore, 2/3 of the girls are 80 girls. These are the girls in the Girl Scout. To find out how many girls are NOT in the Girl Scout, we need to subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the number of girls.
