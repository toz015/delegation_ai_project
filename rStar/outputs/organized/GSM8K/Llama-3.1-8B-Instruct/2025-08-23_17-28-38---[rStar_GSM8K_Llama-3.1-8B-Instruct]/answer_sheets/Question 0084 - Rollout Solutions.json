Also, from condition 2, we know that W = L + 8. We can substitute this second equation into the first one: (L+8) + L = 22. This simplifies to 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8, we get 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that L = 7. Substituting this value back in, we see that W = 7 + 8 = 15. Therefore, the team won 15 games.

Since the football team played 22 games, they lost x games and won (x+8) games. We also know that we can add the number of games they won and lost to get 22. This means x + (x+8) = 22. To solve this equation, first combine like terms. x + x is 2x, so we have 2x + 8 = 22. To isolate x, subtract 8 from both sides. That leaves us with 2x = 14.
