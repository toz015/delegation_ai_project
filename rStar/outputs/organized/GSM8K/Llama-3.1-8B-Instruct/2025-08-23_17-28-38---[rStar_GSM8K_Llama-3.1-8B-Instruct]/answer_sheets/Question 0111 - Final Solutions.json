To find out how much water it takes on per second, we multiply the water it takes on per foot by its speed in feet per second. 0.2 * 1.25 = 0.25 liters per second. The total distance to the shore is not important here because the question asks how much water the boat took on while going towards the shore. The distance isn't needed when calculating time since we already found out how fast it takes on water per second.

First, let's figure out how far the boat can travel in 64 seconds. Condition 2 states it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 10 feet and get 20 feet closer to shore. This means that in one second, Julia can travel 10/16 feet or 0.625 feet (since 10 / 16 = .625). In 64 seconds, Julia would have traveled 64 x .625 = 40 feet. Thus, according to condition 2, the boat is 40 x 20 = 800 feet closer to shore. Therefore, the boat was initially 800 feet away from the shore before starting this journey. According to condition 1, for every 10 feet Julia rows, she takes on 2 liters of water. Therefore, in 40 feet, Julia accumulates 8 liters of water (40 / 10 = 4, and 4 x 2 = 8).
