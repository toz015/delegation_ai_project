Since this isn't the case here, and we're looking for an exact value, we'll use 33.333 as our approximate value for x. To find the actual original value, however, we would need more information about the problem. We should check whether or not the problem allows for a solution that results in an integer. If the final length of the dress is 140cm and 20cm is added at the end, then 120cm must equal the first addition (50%). Thus, the only possible value of the variable is 80cm.

According to condition 1, after extending the length by 50%, its new length will be x + (50/100)*x = x + 0.5x = 1.5x cm. Then, according to condition 2, she adds 20cm to the extended length, making the final length 1.5x + 20 = 140cm. We can now solve for x to find out what the original length was. So, we rearrange 1.5x + 20 = 140cm to get 1.5x = 120cm, and then divide both sides by 1.5 to isolate x, resulting in x = 80cm. Thus, the original length of the dress is 80cm.
