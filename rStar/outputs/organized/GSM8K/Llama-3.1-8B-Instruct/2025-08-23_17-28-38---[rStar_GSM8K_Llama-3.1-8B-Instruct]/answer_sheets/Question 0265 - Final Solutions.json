First we need to find out the total cost of the house. The selling price of the house is $350 000. Then we need to pay 5% brokerage fee, which is $350 000 x (5/100) = $17 500. We also need to pay 12% transfer fee, which is $350 000 x (12/100) = $42 000. Now let's add up the costs. $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $409 500. This is greater than Mrs. Cruz's budget by $409 500 - $400 000 = $9500.
