First, let's calculate the total cost of non-food items. We have already calculated this as 22 dollars in hint 2. Since it's a non-food item, a 10% tax needs to be applied. So, the tax will be 0.1 times 22 which equals 2.20. Adding tax makes the total value of non-food items 22 + 2.20 = 24.20. Next, we need to add this to the cost of food items, which was 40 according to Hint 1. Therefore, the total cost of all the items purchased is 40 + 24.20. This comes out to be 64.20.
