We know that 20 dozens of cups cost less than 6 plates. Let's say the price per cup is P. Since 20 dozens of cups cost less than the price of half a dozen (6) plates, we can set up the following inequality: 20*12*P < 6*6000. This simplifies to 240*P < 36000. Dividing both sides by 240, we get P < 150. \n\nHowever, this problem also tells us that the difference in costs between the two items is $1200.
