The problem states Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Since Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, we divide 400 by 4 to find out how much laundry David does. 400 / 4 = 100. Then since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we need to multiply the amount of laundry Sarah does by .5 (which can also be written as 1/2). Half of 400 is 200. To find the difference between Raymond's amount of laundry and David's, subtract David's amount of laundry from Raymond's. That would be 200 - 100 = 100. The answer is: 100. \n\nThis chat log only includes the problems we solved and the final answers to those problems. We hope this helps you understand the process better!
