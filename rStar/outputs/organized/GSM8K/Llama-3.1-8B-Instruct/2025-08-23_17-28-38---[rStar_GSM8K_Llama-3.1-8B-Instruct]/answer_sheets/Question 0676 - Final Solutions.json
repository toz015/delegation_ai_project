Dylan invests 2/5 of 1200 which is 2/5 * 1200 = 480 dollars. So we need to find out how much Frances and Skyler invest combined, then subtract Dylan's. First let's calculate how much Frances invests. We know 720 is what's left after Dylan's investment. Since Frances invests 2/3 of 720, we multiply 720 by 2/3 which equals 480 dollars. This means that Skyler and Frances together invested 480 + 720 = 1200 dollars. However, since Frances also invested 480 dollars, then Skyler's share is the difference of the collective amount invested by both him and Frances minus the total amount invested by Frances. But since we already know that the amount invested by Dylan plus Frances equals the initial investment, then all that is left for Skyler is the original amount minus the sum of Dylan's and Frances'.
