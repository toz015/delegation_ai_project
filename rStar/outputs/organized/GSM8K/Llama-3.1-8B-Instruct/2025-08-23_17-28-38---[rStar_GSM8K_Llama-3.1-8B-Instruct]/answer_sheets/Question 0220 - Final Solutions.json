We know it takes Carmen 10 minutes to solve a crossword puzzle (Condition 1) and 5 minutes to solve a sudoku puzzle (Condition 2). Hint says we need to find out how long it takes for her to solve both types of puzzles. We can add their times together. 10 + 5 = 15 minutes. (That is what the hint said too.) This is how long it takes her to solve both types. Since she solved 3 crosswords and 8 sudokus over the weekend, we multiply 15 minutes by the number of puzzles she did. Crosswords: 3 * 15 minutes = 45 minutes. Sudokus: 8 * 15 minutes = 120 minutes. All told, she spent 45 + 120 = 165 minutes doing puzzles.
