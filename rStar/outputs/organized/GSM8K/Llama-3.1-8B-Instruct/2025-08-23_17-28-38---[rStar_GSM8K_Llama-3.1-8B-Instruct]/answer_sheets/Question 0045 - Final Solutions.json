We know Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means we need to multiply the number of articles she wrote on Monday (which was 5) by 7/5 to get the number of articles written on Tuesday.

To find out how long it took Meredith to write all these articles, we first need to know how many hours it took to write one article.

That means she wrote 5 + 5 * 2/5 = 7 articles. We can also use hint 1 to get this result.\nAccording to condition 4 and hint 2, Meredith wrote 2 times the number of articles on Wednesday compared to Tuesday. That means she wrote 7 * 2 = 14 articles. We can also use hint 3 to get this result.\nNow we need to calculate the total time spent writing all the articles. From hint 3, we know she wrote 26 articles in 3 days. And it takes 4 hours to write one article. So it took her 26 * 4 = 104 hours to write all those articles.
