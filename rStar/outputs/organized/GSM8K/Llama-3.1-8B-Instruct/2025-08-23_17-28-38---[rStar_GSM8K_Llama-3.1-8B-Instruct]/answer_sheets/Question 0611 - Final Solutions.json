The next thing we need to find is the amount of money spent each subsequent month. Since this is increasing by 50%, we could make a list.

First, let's figure out the budget increase each month after the initial five months. The first month after the initial period costs $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000. This represents an increase of $50,000 ($150,000 - $100,000) from the last month of the initial period. We will use this difference to calculate the cost of each subsequent month. We know that the initial period had five months, and the extended period has forty-five months (50 months - 5 months). Let's calculate the total budget required for these forty-five months, including the increase each month. Month one of the extension is $150,000, and then each subsequent month increases by $50,000 over the prior month. This makes the second month $200,000, the third month $250,000, and so forth until the final month of the extended period. To simplify our calculations, we notice that this sequence forms an arithmetic series. In such a series, where the common difference between consecutive terms is constant, the sum of n terms can be calculated using the formula S = [n * (a * d * n)] . However, we cannot apply this formula directly here because we do not only have the first term but also the last term and the common difference. Instead, we can use another approach to find the total cost of the forty-five months by breaking down the problem. Since the extended period consists of forty-five months, we already know the total number of months. Next, we determine the monthly increment needed to go from the last month of the initial period to the final month of the extended period. If we add the differences together, we get 45 increments of $50,000. Multiplying this by the monthly increment gives us a total of 45 * $50,000 = $2,250,000. We now add this to the last month of the initial period's cost to find the cost of the final month. $150,000 (the last month of the initial period) plus $2,250,000 equals $2,400,000. Now, we simply add up all forty-six monthly budgets: $100,000 for the first five months, plus forty-five months of increased funding, which we found to be $2,400,000.
