If it currently holds 24 books and 19 books are added, how many books can still fit on the shelf? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine how many books the bookshelf can hold. It can hold 45 books. Step 2: Determine how many books are currently on the shelf. There are 24 books on the shelf. Step 3: Determine how many new books are being added. 19 books are being added to the shelf. Step 4: Calculate the current total number of books on the shelf. 24 (initial number of books) + 19 (new books) = 43 books. Step 5: Calculate how many more books can fit on the shelf. Since the bookshelf can hold 45 books and there are 43 books currently, the remaining space is 45 - 43 = 2 books. Step 6: The answer is 2. ### Instruction: Maria bought 120 crayons at school.
