Question: What is the difference in the number of trees in Harry's yard compared to Ferdinand's yard? ", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine the number of trees Ferdinand has based on condition 2, since we know Chris has 6 trees. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees as Chris, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that Chris has 6 trees. According to the second condition, Ferdinand has half of what Chris has which is 6 / 2 = 3. According to the third condition, Harry has 5 more than double (not twice) the number of trees Ferdinand has. Double the number of trees Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6. Adding 5 more makes 6 + 5 = 11. So Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3. To find out the difference, subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has which is 11 - 3 = 8. The answer is: 8. \n\nNote: The question actually asks about the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard compared to Ferdinand's yard, not the difference between Ferdinand's and Chris'. Based on this, the solution is correct as it calculates the difference between Harry's and Ferdinand's trees.

Therefore, we can find out how many trees Ferdinand has by dividing Chris' amount of trees by 2. Chris has 6 trees, so Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3.

Ferdinand has 3 trees, so (3 x 2) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11. Finally, if Harry has 11 trees and Ferdinand has 3, then the difference is 11 - 3 = 8.
