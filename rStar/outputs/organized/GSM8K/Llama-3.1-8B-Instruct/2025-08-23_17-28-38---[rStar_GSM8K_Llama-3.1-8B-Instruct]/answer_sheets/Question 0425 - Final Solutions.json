Next, let's count how many homemade and store-bought bird feeders there are in total. There are 3 homemade ones and 3 store-bought ones, for a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders. 3 homemade ones would attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds, while 3 store-bought ones would attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.

First we need to know how many birds are attracted by homemade feeders, which attracts 30 birds per feeder.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and they attract 20 birds each, the total number of birds they attract is 3 * 20 = 60.
