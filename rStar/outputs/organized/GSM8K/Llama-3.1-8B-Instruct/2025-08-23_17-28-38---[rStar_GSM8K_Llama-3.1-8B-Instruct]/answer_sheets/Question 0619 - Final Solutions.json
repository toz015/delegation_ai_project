First we need to know the total number of poles. Each intersection pole can support 4 street lights. There are 4 intersections. So there are 4 x 6 = 24 poles needed in total. Since each pole can support 4 light bulbs, the total number of lightbulbs supported is 24 poles * 4 lightbulbs/pole = 96 lightbulbs. 20 of these are not functional, which means 96 - 20 = 76 of them are.
