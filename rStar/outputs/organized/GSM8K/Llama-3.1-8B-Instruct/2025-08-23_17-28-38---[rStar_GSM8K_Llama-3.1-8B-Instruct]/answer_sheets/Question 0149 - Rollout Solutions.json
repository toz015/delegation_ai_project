Let us call the number of friends Dorothy has 'D'. Charlie has three times this amount so he has 3D. James has 4 times the number of friends Dorothy has so he has 4D. We know their combined friend count is 3D + 4D + D. This can be simplified to 8D. Since we also know that this equals 27 (from adding the individual amounts), we have 8D = 27. Dividing both sides by 8 means D = 27/8. However, since friendships cannot be fractions, Dorothy has 0 friends. But if we assume it can be divided into whole numbers which may not always be possible, we will consider other possibilities. A simple case could be D=3 which results in 9+12+3=24. Another could be D=1 resulting in 3+4+1=8. Given these examples, the best solution would depend on further context or clarification about Dorothy's actual number of friends.
