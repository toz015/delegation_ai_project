Then, according to the information provided, Ruby's current age can be represented as 6x because she is six times older than Sam."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's break this down into steps using algebra. We know currently, Ruby\u2019s age (which we\u2019ll call R) equals 6 times Sam's age (let us say S). This leads to our first equation: R=6*S.\nIn future when both their ages add up to plus 9(years), it's stated that Ruby would become thrice as old as Sam i.e.,  3*(Sam+9)= Rubies Age+9 . Substituting 'six times Sam' which was expressed earlier ,our second formula becomes :   3*(S+9) = 6*S + 9; solving further gets us to third equation:    3S+27 = 6S+9 or     27-9 = 6S-3S =>         18 = 3S=>         S = 18/3 =>            S = 6. Hence, based on these calculations, Sam is presently aged 6.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
