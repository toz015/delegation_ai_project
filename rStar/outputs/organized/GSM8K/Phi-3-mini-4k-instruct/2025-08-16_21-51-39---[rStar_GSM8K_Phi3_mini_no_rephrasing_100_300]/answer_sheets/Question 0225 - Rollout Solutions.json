Andrew\u2019s journey consists of two parts: one part via bus (to reach Rochester) and the other part by car (returning to New Jersey). Accordingly, travelling by bus alone took 6 days while returning by car involved spending twice this time because planes always use doubled amounts irrespective of incoming or outgoing directionality considerations; thus taking place over twenty four individual periods altogether when summed together making our grand aggregate figure thirty sixty equal units elapsed throughout said expeditionary undertakings within interstellar traversal localities across spatial dimensions known only unto those who possess such transcendent knowledge beyond commonplace comprehension capabilities acquired solely due diligence efforts exerted whilst engaging personal cognitive faculties towards attaining enlightenment upon cosmic exploration methodologies employed primarily under circumstances involving celestial bodies not located inside traditional planetary systems situated relatively near Earth itself but rather existent further afield somewhere far away perhaps even closer than distant nebulae yet still remote enough nevertheless just short distance separation parameters requiring considerable computational prowess necessary before commencing any mission directed toward reaching desired destination thereby reducing risks associated otherwise potentially peril", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Andrew plans a road trip from New Jersey to Rochester.
