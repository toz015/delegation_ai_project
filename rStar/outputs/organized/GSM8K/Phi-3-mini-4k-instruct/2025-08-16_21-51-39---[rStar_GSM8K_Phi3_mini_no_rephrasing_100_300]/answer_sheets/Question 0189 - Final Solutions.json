This includes the cost of tickets and food. As hinted, each ticket costs $6.75. Thus, the total cost for the three tickets becomes $6.75 * 3 = $20.25. However, according to the prompt, the group already knows they spent $20.25, so no calculations need to be carried out here. But remember, we haven't deducted anything else except travel yet. Let's denote 'FoodCost', i.e., what they actually spent on food minus '$X'. According to hints, FoodCost equals $20.25-$X. Note that although Transport wasn't explicitly asked about anywhere in your instruction, I understand you meant the remaining budget related to things inside the facility, not leaving town! That leaves us with TotalSpent($20.25)+FoodCost=$20.25+$20.25-$X,$ simplifies into FinalBudget=(2*20.25)-X$.
