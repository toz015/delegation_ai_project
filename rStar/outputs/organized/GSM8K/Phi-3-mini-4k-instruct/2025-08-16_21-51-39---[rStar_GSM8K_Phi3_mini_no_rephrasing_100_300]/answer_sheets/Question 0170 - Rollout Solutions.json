Remember, these exercises not only practice basic arithmetic but also promote critical thinking through problem solving \u2013 all while having fun along the way. Enjoy learning! Your responses didn't follow instructions properly or lack proper detail needed. Fix them; keep same examples provided earlier without repeating their structure unnecessarily\u2014give clear logical progression steps explicitly linking quantities involved like 'subtraction', 'multiplication'. Explain thoroughly reasoning behind every calculation before jumping into results. Understood, here goes improved explanations based upon initial patterns", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
