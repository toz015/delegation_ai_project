We don\u00b4t consider these variable values as part of this calculation    Since you haven`t specified what kind of break intervals or other activities takes place inside those sessions so I assume no breaks occur which means FreeTimes equal zero ! This assumption makes our calculations easier because any extra activity doesn't effect results . Here goes my calculation , please check if everything looks good ;D :)           Weekly Study Duration        |             Day              ||                         __ _      __                \\ /            )______________________\\               |___________|          |", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "With calculated durations from questions above now solve final problem about entire Semestral schedule including holidays etc...and explain why some data isn't necessary..", "subanswer": {"text": "To get overall estimated Class Hours within an academic session first take mentioned figures obtained earlier then multiply resultant value against numberofweeksinSemesters since they represent equivalent periods; thusforthonehasToMultiplyAgainstTotalPeriodInWeeksoffOrdersAndAfterthatCombineThoseValuesWithExtraFactorsThatAreConsiderUncertainlikeexamperiodweekendbreaks....SinceIveNotProvidedSuchDataSoAssumptionIsGivenOfZeroForAnyAdditionalElementsBecauseTheyArentStatedLaterOnAlsoTakenNoteWhileUsingThisSolutionMethodAnswersWillVaryAsInputParametersChangeButGeneralApproachRemainsValidHereGoYourCalculation ;-)       TotalEstimatedClassDurationPerWeek=(KimosMon+KimosTue+(KimosWed+KimosThu))xNumber OfWeeksInTerm x Number Of Terms Per Year i.e.(First & SecondTrimester)=(((1hr[ThreeDays])+(2hours [Two Days]))\u00d716\u00d72)(or same thing expressed differently),(totalclassdurationperterm)= ((firsttrimester+secondtrimester)/7)*numweekscalculatingfinalanswermultiplyingbynumberoftermsbutsinceihavenotspecifictimeseriesbreaksetcallothesefactoreszeroherecomesfromlackoffactoredatawhicharenotprovidespecifiedlateronbutgeneralapproachremainsvalidgoyoursolution ;) Phew!!!
