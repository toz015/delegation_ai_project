Since the problem states that there is a flat interest rate of 2% per month instead of being calculated as an annual percentage, we can apply straightforward multiplication.\n\nHere's the breakdown: Each month, the debt grows by 2%, which means multiplying the remaining balance by 1.02 (since 1 corresponds to the original value, while 0.02 accounts for the 2%). As this happens once per month, our expression needs to repeat this operation thrice for those three months before subtracting any repayment made by Mandy.
