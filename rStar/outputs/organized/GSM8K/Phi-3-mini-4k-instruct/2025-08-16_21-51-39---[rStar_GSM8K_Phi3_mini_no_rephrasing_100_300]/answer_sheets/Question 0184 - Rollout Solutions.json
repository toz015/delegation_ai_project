To simplify understanding let us consider example , if you want to select items from set [a,b,c], like choosing b&c together would mean selecting r=2 elements out of available N=3 so permutation P(N,R)= N!/(N-R)!=(3!) / (1!=1). This can further simplified into simpler form combining both numerator & denominator values -> [(3\u00d72\u00d71)/[1]=6].

Similarly since dice cubes occur equaly every time you can say their probabilities also happen same way when rolled thus considering just evens no matter what order they come out means counting only those events twice but nevertheless this scenario actually doesn\u2019t apply here because \u2018two consecutive throws\u2019 aren\u2019t really happening together instead being considered separately meaning if your first event was throwing an even number followed immediately by another even number its not different from having thrown once both these ones consecutively due them still occurring independently without alteration based upon previous results.
