Initially, James has 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water type cards totalling up to 90 cards overall (Fire_cards + Grass_cards + Water_cards = 90 cards). When calculating probability as percentages, remember every item counts towards the whole set because it could possibly pick itself during random selection regardless its category i.e., Fire, Grass, or Water.
