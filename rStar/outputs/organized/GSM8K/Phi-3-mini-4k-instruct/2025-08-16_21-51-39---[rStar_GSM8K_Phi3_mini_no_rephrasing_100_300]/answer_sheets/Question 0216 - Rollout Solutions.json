That would be 2000 + (2000*10/100) which equals to 2000+200=$2200. Next we need to figure out what portion gets paid off if you multiply $165 times 12 months, which comes up as $1980. Lastly subtract this value ($1980) from the initial debt($2200). This leaves us with $220-$1980= $220. Thus, Janeth still needs to repay another $220 when all installments are finished.
