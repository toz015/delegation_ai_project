Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Find out how many flamingos the neighbors removed from Sue\u2019s house on Saturday (which turned white).", "subanswer": {"text": "First we find how many flamingos the neighbors initially moved on Saturday which was one third of all original ones so it would equal ,(1/3)x=x/3=. Therefore . We know this because if you take away any other fraction than 1 / 3 ,the equation wouldn't hold up right ? Also since I found earlier that X= 18 hence (.1X)=.(1/.3)(18)=6 therefore six went onto sat saturday night ! It makes sense also becuase only half as many came out compared to what first showed up .. but again remember its just my opinion..not yours or anyone elses !! This means no further math needed! :)", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First let's determine the initial amount of pink flamingos: Let us assume 'p' represents the quantity of pink flamingos, thus according to your hint; \\( \\frac{1}{3}p \\) equals those taken by the neighboring kids i.e., Flamingos became White. Substituting P=18 into our formula yields \\(\\frac{1}{3}(18)\\) equalling to 6 white flamingos introduced on Saturday evening due to painting. Following this logic implies twice fewer returned towards Monday sunrise relative to their prior presence early mornings. Consider next Tuesday afternoon when yet another batch composed likewise adds upwards to twelve identical count pairs made available once overnight restoring balance within contrast against whiteness accumulation during midweek interval post modesty transformation event sequence occurring predominantly upon domestic space boundary encircling resident under scrutiny observation point premises located herein designated territory denoted locality situated domicile property enclosure external perimeter boundaries confining occupant abode demarcation lineary spatial parameters containing individual entity living compartment partition segregated zones defined dwelling habitat area sector restricted access zone limited residence quarter sectional fenced containment bar", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
