Your calculation process seems quite elaborate. However, we don't need such detailed steps here because mathematically speaking, time taken doesn't change even if every person could work twice as fast since productivity was considered only once regardless of individual variations in efficiency. When everyone doubles up, effectively doubling overall production capacity wouldn't impact 'the amount needed', but rather decrease required effort proportionate to original output which maintains our previously calculated four hours consistent. It's not about doing something slower while being able to go quicker simultaneously--but having higher potential performance across board resulting into less collective exertion over identical task volume hence shorter completion span still mirrors initial estimation due to cumulative effect considering optimal conditions throughout entire period without any deviations.

take Calvin and Sophie to put away the leftovers into cupboards together, we need to determine their combined assembly rate while working at the same time. Given the information provided earlier, Calvin assembles zucchini halves at a rate of four per minute whereas Sophie makes twice fewer than him, meaning only two zucchini halves per minute. Their respective contributions therefore sum up to six zucchini halves assembled per minute altogether. Working side by side means neither person waits until the others finish before starting again. Therefore, the amount of food handled gets processed faster because even though one might stop midway through putting something back, the second doesn't wait around so you keep getting forward movement toward your ultimate aim which increases production volume significantly beyond what either worker could achieve solo. Thus understanding their complementary roles lets get down calculating things properly..
