However, assuming they meant 'third', then every third glass priced themselves down by 40%, meaning such glasses now cost $5 minus 40% of $5 ($2), resulting in those specific ones being sold for $3 each. But since our primary task focuses on when taking account both statements together without resolving contradiction between first and fifth questions regarding discount frequency ('second' vs 'third'), I\u2019ll provide response based solely on provided sequence logic \u2014 i.e., considering every \u2018second\u2019 or pairwise item gets reduced rather than sequential reduction starting third one; hence every alternate even numbered item among pairs becomes cheaper due to consistent pattern across sequences defined separately within your text.)
