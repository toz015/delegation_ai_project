To get one third of the pennies you divide the total number (9,300) by three. One third equals 9,300 / 3 which is equal to 3,100 pennies. Next, as we want two thirds, multiply this figure by two. Two thirds means twice the value calculated before so it becomes 3,100 * 2 = 6,200 pennies. Since there are ten cents in every penny, we convert these hundredths to dollars by dividing them by 100. Therefore, six thousand two hundred pennies become sixty-two dollars ($62).
