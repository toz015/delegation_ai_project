With this information I can set up equations like below;  \nW= 3*P     [Because every watermelon cost 3x]    |=>      p = w/3            ...[deriving Equation form one ]      \n\nWe could use either value but lets choose letter `w` instead. Also keep in mind when solving multi-variable system always try using simpler variable names if possible...In addition remember whenever trying to solve multiple variables never make any assumptions just work directly till last calculation..!!!!! This avoids errors ..!Now back to original problem :::                          ----(equation no . )--->         Let\u2019s call quantity X ; hence:- Quantity Total Price formula goes QTY*(Costperunit) => Eqn One & Two combined become :-              i.)QtyTotalPrice_peppers = ((QuantityPe", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now plugging numbers and calculating quantities now should look something similar ->        ** Question Five Part II ***             --|---->(Solved Value)+---&-----<--           As derived earlier , Using number provided (-X=(Quantity)) ==> 4+(-X)=NumberOfitemsSoldByDillionOnThisDayAndSinceEachItemHasItsOwnUniqueIdentificationCodeWithinDatabasesItMeansThatEverySingleOneMustBeSeparatelyTrackedUsingIndividualSerialNumbersAlongSideOtherVitalInformationLikeDateReceivedFromSupplierForQualityControlProcessesPlusBatchSpec", "subanswer": {"text": "From Derived Formulas Combined:(Eqn No.1)*UnitMultipliedwithNo.:--> Subtract NegativeValueofYfromLeft Side-(Subtraction operation): -->Add SameToRightside--> Divide By UnitValuesAsDerivedAbove.(DividedbyEquation NumberTwo)'s Units:[p].So overall FinalFormula Is:-- >((4+(AmountTimesPricesWhenPluggedtoCorrectVariableNames)),/(DeterminePerUnitcostFindingOutWhatistheRatiobetweenVariablesOrHowManyTimeIsFirstMultipledSecond),(RepresentAllItemsbeingConsideredTogetherCombinely)))which becomes :(CalculatedFinalResult);<!-- Answer Step #0 --->)", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, let's determine the price of each fruit. According to the hint, a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and an orange costs five dollars less than a watermelon. Since each pepper costs 15 dollars ($), the following relationships hold true:\n\n- Watermelon Cost (\\$W$) = \\(3 \\times \\$P\\)\n- Orange Cost (\\$O$) = \\(\\$W - \\$5 \\)\n\nGiven that $\\$P = \\$15$, let's substitute into the previous formulas to find the actual dollar amounts.
