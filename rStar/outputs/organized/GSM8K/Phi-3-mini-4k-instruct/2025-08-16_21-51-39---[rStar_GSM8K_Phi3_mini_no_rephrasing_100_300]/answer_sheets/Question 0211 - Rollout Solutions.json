We shall use 'R' for red chickens and 'W' for white chickens. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, whereas each white chicken generates 5 eggs per day. Therefore, our first relationship derived from their production rates would look like this: `3R + 5W` which equals the total collected eggs `(which is 42)`.
