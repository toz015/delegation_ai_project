{"id": 119, "problem": "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.\nIn total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000\nIf four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.\nFour years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000\nAfter receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200\nIn total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.\nThe total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200\n#### 95200", "gold_answer": "95200"}
