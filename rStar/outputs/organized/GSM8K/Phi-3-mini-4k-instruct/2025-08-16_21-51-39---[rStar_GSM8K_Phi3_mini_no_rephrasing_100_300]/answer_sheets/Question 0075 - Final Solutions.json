Instead, we multiply them by their respective factors according to the properties described earlier.\n\nFor the second tier (the next lower level): We know that its surface area equals twice less than the fourth tier. Therefore, we take into account that the sum of squares formed by doubling consecutively yields perfect squares following Pascal's Triangle formula n=squares[n]=(n*(n+1))/2 .
