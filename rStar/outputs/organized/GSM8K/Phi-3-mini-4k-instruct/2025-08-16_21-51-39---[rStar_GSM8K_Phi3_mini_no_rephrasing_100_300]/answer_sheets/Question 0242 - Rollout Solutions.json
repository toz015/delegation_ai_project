Firstly find out the number of incoming mail per person which is 2 (letters) times 5 (pages), equals to 10 pages per friend or all three combined would amount to 10*3=30 pages received daily. Since these also need responses, let's consider another set as well. Each letter takes him six minutes to reply since one sheet requires ten lines i.e., thirty seconds assuming half line width paper size(A4). Thus when considering both sides together time taken becomes twice ie., twelve minutes required per package/letter. Therefore overall spent doing correspondence comes up equaling twenty four minutes multiplied over forty eight because he receives same quantity while replying back too ((doubled numbers due to bi directional communication)).
