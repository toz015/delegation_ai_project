Since we don\u2019t know exactly how long this process usually takes us cannot make any assumptions here so let's proceed without considering these variables. Next up, compare cost savings against expenses when using professional help over personal efforts. An external service provider (accountant) costs $90 while neglecting finances could lead to a financial setback worth approximately $105 based on your data entry error; thus implying a net gain through outsource assistance i.e., subtract overall 'cost saving vs spending': ($90 spent)-($105 saved)=-$15 difference!
