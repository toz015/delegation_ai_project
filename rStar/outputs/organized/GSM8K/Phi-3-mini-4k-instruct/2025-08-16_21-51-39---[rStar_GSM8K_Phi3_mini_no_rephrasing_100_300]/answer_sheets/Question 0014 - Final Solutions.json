Condition 1: 20 students participate in a dance class. Condition 2: Of those students, 20%, or one student (since percentages don\u2019t apply well on small numbers), chose to learn contemporary dance. Consequently, this leaves us effectively with zero 'remaining'. The given situation seems flawed since you can't calculate 25% of something nonexistent without adjusting initial values\u2014let's correct it as follows: Instead let's assume originally two decades participated equally across multiple classes so we could work off realistic figures; hence when saying \"20%,\" perhaps referring actually means dividing amongst groups rather than individual counts within just one class scenario \u2013 otherwise clarification would indeed render such calculations meaningless due to mathematical impossibility stemming directly from misinterpreted data inputs relating absolute quantities not relative proportions/ratios which usually underpin distribution metrics like described above).
