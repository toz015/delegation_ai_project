Additionally, on Wednesday afternoon when Steve went shopping again, he picked up thirty cartons filled with fifty seeds per packet alongside forty large boxes stuffed with seventeen marbles inside them thus adding eighteen hundred fifteen as our next quantity since we multiply both quantities i.e., Thirty multiplied by Fifty equalling One thousand five Hundred along Four times Seventeen making Six Feet Nine hence combined it would result in Two thousand zeroone Forty Three because Nineteen Hundred Plus Eighty Three Equals Two Thousand ZeroOne Forty Three.
