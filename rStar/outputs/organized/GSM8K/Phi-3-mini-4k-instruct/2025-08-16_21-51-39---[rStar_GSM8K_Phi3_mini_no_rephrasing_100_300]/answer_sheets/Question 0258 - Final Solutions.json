We add up both values together before answering completely so here comes our calculation : Total Cost=Cost Per Book+Fine Due Because They're Past Their Date Of Return LimitTotal Owed By Nancy=$4+$2=$<<4+2=6>>6So if those rates apply without considering further information or specific rules about lateness ,then Nina currently owes a sum of six dollars ($4 charged solely based upon quantity ) alongwith another dollar designated towards accountability regarding delaying dates .
