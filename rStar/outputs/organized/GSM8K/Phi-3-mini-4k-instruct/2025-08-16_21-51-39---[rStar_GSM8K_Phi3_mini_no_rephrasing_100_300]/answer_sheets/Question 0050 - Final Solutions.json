First, it states that Lloyd produces 252 eggs every single day. Since there are twelve (12) eggs in a dozen; therefore, dividing these numbers helps you know exactly how many 'dozen' eggs come up which equals `252/12` or approximately **21** dozen eggs. This implies if all your collected eggs get sold, about twenty-one sets worth of eggs could sell off each day when considering whole set sizes only. Second part involves pricing\u2014it says prices tagged onto these lots amounting nearly around `$2`, implying customers buy bunches valued at such costs within their purchasing budgets easily hence facilitated smooth market operations without any hassle whatsoever. To establish individual figures related solely towards profits based purely upon monetary gains rather than mere transactions values like gross revenues etc., take our calculated product quantity above (`x = y`). With respect both terms involved here being equal(`y`), simply proceed via multiplication methodology resulting thereby obtain value represented thus `(xy)`=$21*${$2}= ${$${42}$.
