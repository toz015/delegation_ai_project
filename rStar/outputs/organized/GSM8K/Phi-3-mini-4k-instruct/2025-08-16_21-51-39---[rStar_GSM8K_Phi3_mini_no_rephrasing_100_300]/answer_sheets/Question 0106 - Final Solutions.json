Next using similar logic apply same process for finding the other innermost lengths as well ; thus resulting into : [3(inches), 4(inches), 5(inches)] being your resultant list representing these three inner corners respectively . Finally having obtained those , next task involves multiplying corresponding values across all coordinates thereby producing following equation -> sum([inner[i]**2 for i in range(len(inner))]) & solving yields us value ~ **29** approximately . Thus concluding calculation yielding area within interior space formed under described conditions amounts about roughly around square units =~~ **29 sqr units** .. !!! Well Done !!
