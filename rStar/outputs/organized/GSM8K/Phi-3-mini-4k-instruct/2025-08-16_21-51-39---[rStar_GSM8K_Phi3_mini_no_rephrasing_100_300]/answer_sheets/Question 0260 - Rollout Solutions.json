Divide 36 by 12 to find the number of groups. This means Carla makes \\( \\frac{36}{12} = 3 \\) sets of 12 cookies today. Step 2: Find out how many groups of 12 come from 30 cookies using similar logic. You divide 30 by 12 to obtain approximately 2.5, meaning Carla makes roughly 2 complete sets plus another group near completion. However, since Cookies cannot be divided into fractions here so round down to whole units instead resulting in exactly 2 groups. Note! We treat incomplete sets differently later. It\u2019s important because fractional parts don't apply directly like integers.

Similarly, similarly ,for thirty cookies next day .
