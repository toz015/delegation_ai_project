Thus, if sandy wants to make x number of flans then egg needed would be 3x; therefore set up an equation whereby 'eggs required=flans*eats per batch'. Then substitute known values from problem statement such that  3(15)=x , solve for value of x . This results in x=<<3*15=45>>45 thus Sandra will require 45 eggs altogether.

Hence my final calculation leads me back again resulting no change ie still same output even though changed scenario seems logical now ! But yes mathematically speaking when u look closely without considering practicalities here lies something funny lol!!
