We know that Peter covers the whole boundary (perimeter) of the rectangular park while walking, so firstly let\u2019s calculate it following hint provided above; hence Total distance covered when Peter walked through all four sides would equal 15 miles because circumference equals twice summed up lengths of both shorter side plus longer ones i.e., Circumference=(Length of Rectangle \u00d7 2)+(Width of Rectangle\u00d72).
