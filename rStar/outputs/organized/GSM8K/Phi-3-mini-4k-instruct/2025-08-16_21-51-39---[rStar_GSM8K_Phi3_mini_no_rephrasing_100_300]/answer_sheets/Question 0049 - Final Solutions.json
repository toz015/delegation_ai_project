Accordingly as laid out in condition two, it's indicated that just about three quarters or specifically seventy-five percent (or precisely .75) of such accommodations presently house residents thus leaving roughly twenty-five percent unoccupied i.e., quarter empty. To determine our target numerator which represents occupied rooms according to current data presented, multiply your whole population amount (.75 times 120)=<<(.75)*120=90>>90 spots filled up. Consequently subtracting said figures equates to discerning disused lodgings hence 120 minus 90 equals <<120-90=30>> thirty compartments lying deserted amidst residence offering opportunities still present.
