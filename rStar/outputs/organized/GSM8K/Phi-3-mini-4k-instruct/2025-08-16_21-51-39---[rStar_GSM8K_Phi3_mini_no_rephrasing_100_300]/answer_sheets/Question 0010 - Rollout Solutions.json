Initially, we know the program had 60 downloads (D_1) in its first month. It says here it had thrice these initial figures in the following month i.e., D_2=3*60 = 180. During the next phase, which occurs within our contextual period marked 'the third month', its rate dropped significantly due largely attributed to external factors namely, seasonal trends or perhaps market saturation among others. As per provided hints about percentage reductions experienced particularly around midyear holidays when people shift their online activities towards other forms of entertainment such gaming platforms etc.; therefore downloading frequency dips somewhat notably henceforth leading us onto considering approximately half off current rates equalling roughly thirty percent overall loss thus affecting numbers accordingly resulting directly contributing toward diminished interest levels potentially explained further along including reasons surrounding decreased engagement like growing fatigue causing attrition amongst initially interested users albeit still maintaining base level activity unwaveringly nonetheless unable sustain peak performance metrics previously observed earlier stages throughout entirety undergone temporal progression spanning multiple calendar cycles stretching broad spectrum encompassing full year duration inclus", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
