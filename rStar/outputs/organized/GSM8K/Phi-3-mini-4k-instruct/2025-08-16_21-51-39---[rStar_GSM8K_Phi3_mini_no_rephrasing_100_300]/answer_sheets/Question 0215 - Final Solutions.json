This shows us this sum represents what it costs if we purchase these goods separately without any discount or offer applied. Yet according to your question about 'how long Lori needs working hours', I misunderstood; you want me not just find the item(items)' total cost but also figure out work time required before affording them based solely upon wage earned per hr ($8/hr): henceforth multiply said unit rate times quantity needed i.e., $(352)/$8=x hrs . Resultant outcome presents value being worked necessary prior obtaining specified merchandise totals amount via labor compensation alone.- To solve further divide entire expense into smaller units like individual purchases first & subsequently employ multiplication methodology using employee paycheck figures accordingly!", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First let's add the cost of the shoes and belt together: $320 + $32 = $352\nNow we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford these items.
