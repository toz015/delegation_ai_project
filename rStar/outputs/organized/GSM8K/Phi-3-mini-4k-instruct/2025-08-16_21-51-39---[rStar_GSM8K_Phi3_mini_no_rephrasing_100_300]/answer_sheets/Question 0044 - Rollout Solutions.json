Each candle needs \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) pounds of beeswax because you get 10 candles out of 1 pound. Therefore, to make 20 candles, you need \\( 20 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 2 \\) pounds of beeswax. Since beeswax costs $10 per pound, your total initial cost equals \\$10 \\(\\times\\) 2 = $20.\n   Next, find the sale revenue. You sell each candle for $2, meaning earnings equal $2 times 20 (the number of candles) which totals to $40. Finally, compute the difference between revenues earned and invested capital represented below respectively denoted as Net Profit (\\$NP): $\\$40 - \\$20$, yielding NP= $20$.

But remember that your actual expenses may vary according to location & time! Thus assuming all goes well within normal circumstances\u2026 Our goal becomes finding our Profit Margin %.

We know he made and sold twenty candles hence Quantity_Sold=20 .\n\nStep 2: Identify Selling Price Per Unit SalesPricePerUnit=$2 .\n\nUsing Step 1 data above along with Step 2 ,TotalRevenue=(Quantity_Sold*SalesPricePerUnit)==($2)*(20)=$40 .\n\nNow lets get into Direct Production Cost :DirectCostOfGoodsProduced.
