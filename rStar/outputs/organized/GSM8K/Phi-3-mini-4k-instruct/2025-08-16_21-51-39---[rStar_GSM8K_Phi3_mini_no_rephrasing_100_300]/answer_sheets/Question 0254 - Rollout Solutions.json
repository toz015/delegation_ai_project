You would divide your result above into two parts; first part being equal division based upon their respective actions while secondly dividing them according too percents mentioned earlier resulting thus :   X/Y * Z/(X+Z)=Certainty(x*y)/((x)+(z))     Here , Certainty refers towards confidence level expressed through certain mathematical operations involving fractions etc.; hence allowing easier interpretation when considering probabilities related issues thereby avoiding confusion arising due lack knowledge wrt complex equations involved within said domain area called statistics although similar approaches applied here involve simpler ones requiring basic understanding necessary especially amongst younger audiences studying highschool physics whose subjects generally include topics such algebra geometry trigonometry calculus probability stats mechanics electrical circuits optics light interference waves vibrations harmonic oscillators thermod"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's breakdown this problem step by step. First off, let us find out how many times Ann went down the slides. Given that she went down the slide 30% (or .3) less often than Mitchell who went down 30 times, therefore the calculation becomes: 30*(1-.3) which equals 21. This means Ann also traveled around the water slide twenty-one times.\nNow moving forward, Robert travels four times more frequently than Anna i.e., multiplying Ann\u2019s count by 4 results in 21 * 4 equalling 84. Hence, Robert journeyed down the waterslide eighty-four times during the same period. Therefore, taking advantage of our previous calculations combined alongside simple multiplication methodology allows arriving at these conclusions efficiently ensuring clear comprehension regardless of complexity or sophistication present among diverse demographic groups including young learners delving deeper into realms encompassing theoretical domains namely statistical analysis whilst simultaneously acquiring pivotal insights tied directly correlated concepts relating primarily areas entailing advanced levels mathematics allied fields comprising integral differential notably complementary subfields encapsulating intricate nuances embedded", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Shelly's 3 kids spent all day at the water park.
