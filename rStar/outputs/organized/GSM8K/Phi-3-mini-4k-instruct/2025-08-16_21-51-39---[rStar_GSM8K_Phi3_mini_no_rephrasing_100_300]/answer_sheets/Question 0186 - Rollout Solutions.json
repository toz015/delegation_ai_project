There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?", "ost_step": {"1": "Firstly we need to calculate how much straw was provided for all types of animals except rats because those quantities aren\u2019t involved yet. Hamsters received a total amount calculated as follows: 10 cages * 5 pieces per hamster = 50 pieces; Rabbits got 20 pieces on their own without grouping them into any specific quantity like cages or similar units. That sums up to 70 pieces so far (50 for hamsters + 20 for rabbits). This information tells us what part of the overall distribution doesn't involve rats. We know that Russell distributes altogether 160 pieces of straw including these mentioned above. Thus, subtract this sum from the total piece count to get how much it took to feed the rats: 160 \u2013 70=90 pieces remaining for rats only. As stated earlier every group of three cages contains exactly same amount of rats receiving identical amounts of individual servings equals to  90 /(crossover_ratio*numberOfCages)=90/(3x)=30rats/group x . Hence answering your question about 'how many rats are in each cage':", "2": "Divide the remainder equally over two groups since he divided even across all thirty rats but not within themselves i.e., if you add one extra group then you would end up dividing fifty five amongst fifteen giving fourteen plus seventeen making twenty one right ?
