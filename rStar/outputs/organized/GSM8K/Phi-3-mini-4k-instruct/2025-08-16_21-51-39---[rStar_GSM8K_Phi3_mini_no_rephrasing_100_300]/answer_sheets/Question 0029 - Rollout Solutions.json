Adding these amounts provides us with their cumulative value before any discount related to the boots; hence our equation looks like this:\nB - $5 = ($33 + $66)\nSolving further yields:\nB - $5 = $99\nLastly adding $5 back reveals what the initial boot price was:\nB= $99+$5 => B=$104", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget.

One pair of heels costs $33, while the second costs twice this amount, which means it'll cost 2*33=$66. Combined price equals $33+$66= $99. As Gloria can afford either item but prefers buying only the boot because its cheaper compared to these two items (together), so let\u2019s figure our what was spent firstly before subtraction or addition operation occurs; B \u2013 H+H <=B<(B+C) --> B>=($99-$5)--->$94<=B. Therefore considering gloria\u2019s options available & taking into account previous equation above shows us clearly enough that option D ($123) exceeds allowed range hence eliminated immediately along w/o further calculations required hereafter! Consequently based upon information presented thus far alongside deductions made previously therefore suitable choice falls under Category C representing exactly '$94'.
