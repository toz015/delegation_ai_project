How much did he pay in total in dollars?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much would be spent if all the items cost their respective price times quantity?", "subanswer": {"text": "First we calculate amount Peter spend buying popsicles; it costs him (price)x(quantity): ($0.25)*(20)=$5. Next let us find out what was spend on purchasing ice bares: (Price)*(Quantity)=($0.50)*(4)=$2 . Finally sum both amounts together so get result as following $(5)+($2)=$(7). Hence your answer can be expressed using mathematical notation this way:(P*Q+B*C=D), which translates into English like follows:\"Total Amount Spent=(Cost per Push Up Ball * Quantity of push up Balls Added )+( Cost Per Ice Cream Bar * Quantity Of Ice Cream Bars)\" Therefore since our values replaced previous variables correctly based upon context,(7=$0.25*20+$0.50*4 ). Thus you could say \"(amount spent)=(cost/purchase unit)(number units purchased)\", but i understand why its confusing because not everyone knows math formulas such these one! This just means We calculated Price Multiplied By Number Equals Sum , Where Prices Are Separately Given As One Value Each And Numsrely Represent Thems", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much did he pay in total in dollars?", "subanswer": {"text": "Based on calculations from Question 5.1, he paid a total of 7 dollars.
