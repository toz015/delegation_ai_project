We know, one hour contains 60 minutes so let\u2019s convert all times into minute first. It took 3 minutes/hole \u00d7 30 holes=<<3*30=90>>90 mins for small holes. And also  10 min/tree\u00d715 holes= <<10*15=150>>150mins for tree roots. Total tasking was equal to 90+150=<<90+150=240>>240 mins. To calculate this amount per hour you divide initial time value(here its 240) over 60 because there are 60minutes in every hour or simply multiply original input values divided by 60 like shown below : 240\u00f760=<<240/60=4>>4Hours.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs and 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.

Firstly we calculate the time needed for digging the smaller holes (shrub holes). Each one takes Matthew 3 minutes, but since he wants to make three of these kinds, we multiply that single duration by 30 which equals 3x30 minuets i.e., 90 minutes. This amount converts into 1 hour and 30 minutes because 60 minutes formulate as an full hour whereas remainder is just half an hour(since our base unit here being minute) . Secondly ,we compute the timings associated with larger ones (tree holes), every individual task requiring 10 minutes therefore multiplying them all together results us having ; 10mins X 15holes= 150minutes ,which translates backward onto; 2hours & 30 minutes following conversion rules mentioned beforehand .
