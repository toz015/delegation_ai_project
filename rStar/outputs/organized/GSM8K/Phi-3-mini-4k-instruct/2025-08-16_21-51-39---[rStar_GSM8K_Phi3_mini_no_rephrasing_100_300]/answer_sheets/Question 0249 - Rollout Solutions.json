First find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday: Since she ate four times as many cookies as her sister who ate 5, we calculate Sue\u2019s cookie consumption like this: \\( \\text{Monday Cookies} = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) cookies. Next, determine how many she ate on Tuesday which was double what her sister consumed (which would be 13): \\( \\text{Tuesday Cookies} = 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\) cookies. To get the total amount Sue ate over the weekend add up those numbers together: \\( \\text{Total Cookies} = 20 + 26 = 46 \\) cookies.
