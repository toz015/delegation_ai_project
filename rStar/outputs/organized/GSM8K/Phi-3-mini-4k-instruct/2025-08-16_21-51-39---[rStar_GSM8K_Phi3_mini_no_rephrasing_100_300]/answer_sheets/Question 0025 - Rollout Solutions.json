Adding these together gives us $12 + $15 + $6 = $33 as the sum spent on non-pizza food items. Since Marie paid a total of $50 we can find out how much she spent on pizzas alone by subtracting this figure ($33) from her overall payment ($50), leading to $50-$33= $17 being allocated towards buying pizzas. Given that every pizza costs $8.50, dividing the remainder i.e., $17/$8.50 equates approximately to 2 boxes of pizza since it rounds down because you cannot purchase part or fraction of a pizza box.
