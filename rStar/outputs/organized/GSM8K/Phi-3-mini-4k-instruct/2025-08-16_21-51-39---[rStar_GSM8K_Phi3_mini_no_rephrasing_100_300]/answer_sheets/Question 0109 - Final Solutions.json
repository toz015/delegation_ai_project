In our case, 'n' refers to 10 since they bought ten gallons worth of fuel making calculation thus: $(-.20)*(10)= $-2$. Hence subtracted value becomes minus-$2 because adding negative sign indicates removal henceforth resulting equation reads:$30+$(-$2)$. Finally simplifying yields final sum equaling $28 representing post purchase monetary balance following said promotional offer implementation.$28 rounded down=$28 exactly owing to no fractional units involved during calculations.(Note resultant figure isn\u2019t directly stated but inferred via rounding convention indicating nearest whole integer closest to presented outcome.)
