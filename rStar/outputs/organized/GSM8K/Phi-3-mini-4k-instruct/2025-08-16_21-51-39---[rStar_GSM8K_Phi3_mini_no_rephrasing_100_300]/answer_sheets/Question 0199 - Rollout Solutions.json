We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence and Publisher B pays double this amount which means Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence. Let X represent the number of sentences edited by both Publishers because it\u2019s stated that he works equally divided among them i.e., one half (X) goes to Publisher A and another equals half (X). Since these amounts add up to 1000 words we can set our equation as follows :  2(cents/word)*x + 5*(cents/word)*x=total word count*value.*Total value earned would thus become;    \n    => Total earning E=(2+5)(Cents)/Word*(Words / 2)= (7 Cents )*( Words /2)      From here since you want Number of Sentences worked , divide Earns/(Rate Per Word), therefore                           N =Earnings/(ratePersentence)             Substitute values into formula       -->N =[(7*$ .10)$]/($ .05)            --> Final calculation--> N=.7/$ .05", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate N using above formula ==>", "2": "Total_sentences = Number_of_publishers * Sentences_per_publisher ===> n*n/2==>=sqrt(total_sentence).
