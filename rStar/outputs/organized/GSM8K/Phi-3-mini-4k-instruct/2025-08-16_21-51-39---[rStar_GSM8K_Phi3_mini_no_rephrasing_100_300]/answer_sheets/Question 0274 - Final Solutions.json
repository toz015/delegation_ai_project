Thus far, exclusive consideration remains confined only to economic allocations exclusively allotted towards purchase activities linked directly to said solanum lycopersicum cultivars identified via botanical nomenclature systems employing binomial typologies representative of species classified taxonomically beneath angiosperms belonging principally to Solanaceae family lineage emblematic primarily of temperate climatology zones necessitating distinct agronomic considerations informed respectively"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, we calculate the amount spent on tomato seeds: 20 packs times $40 equals $800. Next, we find out how much was spent on celery seeds: 80 packs times $30 equals $2400. To get the total amount spent, add both totals together: $800 (for tomatoes) plus $2400 (for celery), which equals $3200.
