Thus we can express this relationship mathematically like so; **J=M+2**     [Equation 1]      [(EQUATION 1)] Here it means if you subtract 'Mark' value from Jean, your resultant would always add up to 2 since Jean or any person who claims themselves being younger/older doesn't change base year.]       [[CORRECT]]                        (ii) This part says mark aged exactly twice which also mean same thing but instead use equation above. It indicates difference btw ages not actual values!         To solve this problem using algebra alone isn't possible because no single variable could represent both names hence introducing new variables & solving system equations becomes necessary             Therefore here I am assuming another name called \u2018Jan\u2019 exists whose age needs calculation thereby making these four people unique characters required within scope            Henceforth representing every character mentioned beforehand          And accordingly proceeding furtherwards           ***Note***:- While working out problems involving relationships among different entities such as humans, animals etc., one generally", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Given information tells us:\n\n1) Whenever someone states \u201cX\u201d is Y years older than Z\u201d, it directly translates into X=(Z)+Y ; meaning whatever Difference comes first followed next signifies adding onto last member involved thus increasing its numerical worth ] .              Similarly whenever anyone speaks \u201dWhen somebody used words something happened during past time period say N Years back\" , again according to direct instruction received while analysing said statement lets transform all those scenarios expressed through human language terms including phrases pertaining specifically towards relative chronological differences amongst various members belonging to certain groups denoted earlier just simply assign respective numbers to persons concerned i.e take away corresponding amount stated right afterwards relating specific individual having occurred eventuality else place equivalent symbol indicating negative numeral representation].                Let me rephrase what actually happens : Everytime phrase talks about comparing relations between individuals stating either increment /decrement occurrences concerning varying timelines upon comparison basis occurs therefore mathematical expression turns conventional natural speech terminologies into simplified form represented via symbols assigned particular integer significance keeping trackage order intact[eg.: Statement saying Person P stands higher ranking due date compared against Date Q implies following notation holds true ->P >Q]; Conversely similar logic applies whil", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
