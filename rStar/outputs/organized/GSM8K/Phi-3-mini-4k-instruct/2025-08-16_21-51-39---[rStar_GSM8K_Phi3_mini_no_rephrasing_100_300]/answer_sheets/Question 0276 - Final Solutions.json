However, here's a breakdown assuming all steps proceed linearly following your hints (and making necessary assumptions): Let's go back to calculating starting again using clear details: Initially, Carly starts with 80 cards. Out of these, \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) have the letter 'A', which equates to \\( 80 \\times \\frac{2}{5} = 32 \\) cards. This leaves us with \\( 80 - 32 = 48 \\) cards not having 'A'. Next, out of those remaining cards, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) have the letter 'B', amounting to \\( 48 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 24 \\) cards; thus leaving another \\( 48 - 24 = 24 \\) unsure yet identifiable cards.

This brings us neatly close enough toward zero such that even assuming nonzero probabilities associated wtih individual occurrences occur randomly along its length\u2014although highly unlikely indeed--we might expect very few instances overall wherein both conditions coincidentally met simultaneously within identical sequences containing several adjacent symbols together forming cohesive units ; e g \u201cABC\u201d could perhaps serve example purpose here ! Finally since no information available indicates specific preference regarding selection methods among said groups whether purely deterministic vs probabilistic approaches should prevail ultimately deciding final output depends upon contextual factors surrounding particular application under consideration making appropriate determination difficult unless additional data provided explicitly indicating same fact..
