We know each chocolate bar weighs 40g and since it's stated that one chocolate bar weighs twice as much as one candied apple, this means each candied apple weights half the weight of a chocolate bar which would make them weigh 40 / 2 = 20g. To find out the overall weight of all items (chocolate bars & candied apples), firstly calculate their combined individual weight; 25 chocolate bars times 40 g equals 1,000 g or 1 kg just for those alone. Secondly, compute the collective weight of the 80 candied apples thus equaling 80 times 20 equalling 1,600 g or roughly 1.6 kg. When you add up these figures together \u2013 1 kg plus approximately 1.6 kg\u2014you get about 2.6 kilograms total.
