Consequently, if you consider just one standard academic interval, encompassing what would traditionally amount up To calculate the number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day based only on normal teaching sessions without considering breaks or non-standard schedules, first find out the total number of usages across all teachers: since each of the four teachers utilizes the whiteboard once per subject/lesson during their respective subjects, so multiplying these numbers yields eight slots filled with instructive content concerning said materials", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A classroom has a whiteboard which is shared between the 4 teachers who take turns using the classroom.
