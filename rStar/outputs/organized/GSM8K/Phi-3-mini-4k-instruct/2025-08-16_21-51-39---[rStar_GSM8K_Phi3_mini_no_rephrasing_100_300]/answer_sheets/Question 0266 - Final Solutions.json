In terms of an algebraic expression representing Transaction Cost ('TC'), thus one could express it as such when considering Sales Price('SP') i.e., \\(TC(x) = SP(x) \\times P_t\\). Hereby substituting values accordingly results in \\(TC(sp) = Sp \\times pt\\) equating to \\(TC(sp) = Sp \\times 0.08\\).
