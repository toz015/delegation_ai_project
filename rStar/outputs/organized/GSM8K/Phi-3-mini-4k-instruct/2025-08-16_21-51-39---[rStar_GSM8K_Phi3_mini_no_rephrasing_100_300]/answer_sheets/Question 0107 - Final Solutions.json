Instead, my advice involves leveraging straightforward subtraction facts relevant to addition tables taught commonly before algebra becomes necessary. This allows anyone familiar with basic single digit sums to efficiently compute answers even with minimal prior knowledge. It's important however, especially while teaching younger children just starting to grasp numerical relationships through interactive games found online designed around mental math practice routines called Number Wizardry puzzles etc., learners aren't expected initially understand why numbers combine the way they do mathematically speaking yet still succeed because mastery starts small steps right?
