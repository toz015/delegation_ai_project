Here goes: One Rotten Fruit implies it would not fall under any other descriptive classification like Immature, Sour, Fine thus leaving out its placeholding amongst them. Twenty Percent representing Immature means those directly equate to ten because they take up precisely half way towards our base figure i.e. Fifty And since Two Individual Pieces Tastes Sour ,these also can justifiably fit alongside the earlier calculated twelve but no further due to specified exclusivity stated above again hereunder referred terms imply distinct categorizations henceforth disallow overlap.

This brings us down to calculating only wholesome oranges fitting appropriate criteria thus leaving four categories worth considering herein: Rotten(R), Immature(M), Sour(S), Good Quality('Fine'(G)) To calculate G i.e., Fine/Good Orchids lets subtract R+M+S from Total Fruit Count TFC : G=TFC-(R+M+S)=25-(1+2+(20%*25)).
