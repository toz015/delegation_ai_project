Condition 3: Post error occurrence analysis revealed that subsequent active cycles exhibited varied durations ranging upwards depending upon certain environmental factors like ambient temperature variance affecting sensor thresholds causing differential response rates; however under standard operating parameters where typical duration benchmarks prevail\u2014alarms tend adhere strictly following predefined interval protocols ensuring consistency across sessions barring exceptional circumstances (e.g., maintenance downtimes).

metrics related to alarms, specifically referring to Gregory's alarm usage, we focus on counting genuine, routine uses distinct from isolated anomalies. An 'instance', in this case, refers to the clockwise rotation completed by the hands of the watch before it triggers an alarm. Therefore, unless stated differently through detailed logs indicating different behavior modes induced by varying influencing elements outside usual operational scope, all rotations completing the time display prior to setting off an alarm constitute conventional activity counts irrespective of their repetition rate variations observed temporarily, assuming no recurrent faulty situations occur independently resulting in spontaneous noise generation besides what initially intended mechanisms permit Your previous explanation lacked depth.
