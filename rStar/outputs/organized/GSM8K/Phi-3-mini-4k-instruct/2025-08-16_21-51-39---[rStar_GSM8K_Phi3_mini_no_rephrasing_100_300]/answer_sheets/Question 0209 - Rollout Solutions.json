We know these 240 cups together cost $1200 less than $36,000 so we subtract one value from another; i.e.,  36,000 minus 1,200 equates to $34,800 as our resultant amount spent purchasing all those cups altogether over time.

With each plate priced at $6000, their combined value would be 6 x $6000 = $36000. Since twenty dozen (or 240) cups cost $1200 less than these plates, they therefore cost $36000 - $1200 = $34800 altogether. To determine the individual cup price, you divide its collective expense ($34800) by its count (240), yielding approximately $145 per unit or fractional dollar if necessary round up to achieve whole numbers. Hence, the response should read \"$<$X$, where $X represents an approximate figure based off division result.\" We find our exact solution here; dividing 34800 by 240 provides us precisely $145 per item\u2014and no need exists for approximation since both numerator and denominator share common factors resulting in neatly divisible figures without decimal places attached!
