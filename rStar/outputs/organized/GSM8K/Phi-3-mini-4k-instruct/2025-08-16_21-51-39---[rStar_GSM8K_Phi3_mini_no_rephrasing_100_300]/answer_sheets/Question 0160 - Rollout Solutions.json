Let's follow through as hinted, first finding out the increase which happens on Tuesday making it become (17+7) = 24 feet deep. That implies on Tuesday before any reduction happened, the container held twice the normal value when compared against its present state i.e., if you multiply both sides of equation ((W/2)-X)=2*((W/2))=(x)*(y), rearranging terms yields X=(W^2)/2 meaning no matter whether Y or not holds significance because W doesn\u2019t depend upon either factor but just squared itself divided over half.. We find thusly : Z_new=(Z_old*(Y/X)). Applying values herein , one finds ; new z equals old times ratios so .
