Since we know their combined ages equal 162 and that their individual ages correspond respectively to the numbers in the ratio (7+11=18), we can divide this value into our summed up figure i.e.,  162/18 which equals to 9 hence representing one 'unit'. Next, according to the proportion defined earlier; all three men present themselves as multiples of these units so therefore it follows if you multiply any unit representation against either side of your original equation (i.e., 7x or 11x) would resultantly produce their respective proportions \u2013 thus establishing both individuals actualized values being calculated subsequently through multiplication based upon said universal representative \u2018nation,\u2019 such calculations resulting below accordingly : Darrel currently stands at 7*9(his set coefficient multiplied by its common counterpart); equalling to 63 whereas Allens own numerical equivalent totals namely; 11*9amountingsimilarlyresultingto99total.
