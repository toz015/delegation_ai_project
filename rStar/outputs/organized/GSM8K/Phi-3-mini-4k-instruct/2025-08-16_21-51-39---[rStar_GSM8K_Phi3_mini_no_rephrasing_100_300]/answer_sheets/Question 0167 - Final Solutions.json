According to the problem statement \u201cSeth is twice as old as Brook\u201d. This can mathematically be represented as `Brook Age= x/2`. Also according to question it states that 'In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.' Thus we get another mathematical expression representing this scenario which could look like `(x+2)+(x/2+2)=28` . Solving these equations simultaneously would yield us Seth\u2019s present age.. Let me go ahead solving\u2026 so if you combine both terms together (keeping common denominators), the resultant equation becomes `3x/2 + 4 = 28.` Subtracting 4 from both sides results into `3x/2 = 24;` multiplying through by 2 gets rid of the fraction leading up to `3x = 48;` finally dividing everything by three yields our desired outcome i.e., `\"x\"`, or equivalently `'Seth's current age'` equals to `16 Years`.
