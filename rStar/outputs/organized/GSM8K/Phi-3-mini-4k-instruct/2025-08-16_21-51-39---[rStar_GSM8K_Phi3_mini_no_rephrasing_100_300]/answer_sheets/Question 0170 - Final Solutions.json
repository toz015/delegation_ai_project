Therefore, the jacket costs `$25 * 3` = `$75`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Price of Pants Using Their Relation to Other Items**  \nWe know that the price of the pants equals the average cost of the hat and jacket. Given this relation, it means half the amount (`$\\frac{1}{2}$`) of the jacket's cost gets added to the remaining half of the same amount from the hat's cost. Mathematically speaking, this relationship simplifies directly into finding the middle point `(Jacket Price + Hat Price)` / 2 since both contribute equally through averaging.
