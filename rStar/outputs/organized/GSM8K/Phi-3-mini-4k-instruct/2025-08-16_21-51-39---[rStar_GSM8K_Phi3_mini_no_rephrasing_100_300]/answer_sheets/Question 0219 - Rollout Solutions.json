How many points did Jojo score?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First we need to find out what fraction of all scores was contributed by Naomi so (Naomi\u2019s Score) / (Total Points) equals [latex]\\frac{68}{251}[/latex]. Since this question asks us only about Yuri & Jojo who together made up [(Yuri\u2019s Score] +[Jojo\u2019s Score]) , let me first figure it out before I get into solving any equations : . Here goes my process flowchart... It may seem like overkill but its worth doing just one time ;-) ...(Click picture below)... Once you can visually see your thinking process working through every detail involved here --you might realize not everything written above needs such lengthy explanations :-) .. But still having said that \u2013 lets go ahead using algebra ! We know that \u2018total_points\u2019=\u2018naomi_score\u2019+['yiuri_score']+['brianna_score']+'jojos_score'. Lets replace those 'unknown variables' starting off our equation solution workflow; ----> ['naomi_score']=[latex]\\frac{68}{251} \\times {total\\_points}[/latex]; --> ('yiuri_score')", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
