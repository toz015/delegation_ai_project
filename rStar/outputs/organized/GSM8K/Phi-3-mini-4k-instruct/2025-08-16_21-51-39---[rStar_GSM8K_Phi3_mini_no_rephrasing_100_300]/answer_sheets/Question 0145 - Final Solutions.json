To determine the number of pineapples John can harvest within a year across all ten hectares, you multiply the productivity rate of the pineapples per hectare ($100$ apples per $1 \\text{ hectare}$) by the area under cultivation ($10$ hectares). This results in an overall production capacity $(100 \\, \\text{pineapples} \\times 10)$ equaling $1,000", "subanswer": {"text": "With ten hectares available and assuming uninterrupted growth over a standard agricultural calendar where plants produce their full yield once during such cycles typically spread out evenly between plantings, multiplication then dictates that our end result should be calculated via direct application of these values multiplicatively; consequently resulting in precisely $\\boxed{\\textbf{(10)}\\,\\underline{\\hspace{.7cm}}\\,(100\\, \\mathrm{pineapples})=\\mathbf{1000}\\,\\overline{\\phantom{..}\\,}$.
