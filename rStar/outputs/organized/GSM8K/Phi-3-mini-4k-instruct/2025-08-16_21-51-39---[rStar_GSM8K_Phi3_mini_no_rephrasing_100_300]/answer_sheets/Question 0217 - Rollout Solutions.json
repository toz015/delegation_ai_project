To find the sum Total Number Of Flowers Inside Vase(TNF) : TNF=No_of_Roses+Extra NoOfFlowers; Here As We Know :-Number_Of_Roses=(Initial count)=Total Count Rows-(ExtrasCount); Extra_FlowerType='Daisy';Final Step:-Calculate Final Value Using Previous Expressions Substituting values calculated previously into previous equations & simplifying results => Summing up expressions yields result=>", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are 4 roses in the vase.

Dahlias count as 7 more than this quantity i.e., (4+7) or 11. Total flowers thus equals Roses plus Dahlias which means it\u2019s equal to (4+11).
