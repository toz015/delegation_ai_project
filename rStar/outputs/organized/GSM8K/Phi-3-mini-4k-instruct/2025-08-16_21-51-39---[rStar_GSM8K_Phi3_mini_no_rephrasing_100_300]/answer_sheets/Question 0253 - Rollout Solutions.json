Here we need to multiply 'times his starting floor' i.e., Bill\u2019s original position multiplied by four(that means \u2018*') , so it comes earlier than adding sixes('+'). Therefore, any mathematical expression formed following these rules would look like this : ((starting_floor) \\* X ) + Y . This simplifies as per our question into  3\\*X +\\ 6.. But since no additional bracket was provided around ('X'), the order remains unchanged here too. Consequently; performing division/multiplication takes precedence over execution of subsequent additions/'subtractions'. Thus your calculation process begins firstly addressing all instances involving either factorial computations(*), exponentiation (**), square root extractions(\\sqrt{} ), logarithmic evaluations()^(), absolute value determinations(| |).
