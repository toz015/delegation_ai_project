In 5 minutes, the distance he can travel is 4400 feet. To find the distance from Tim's house to Steve's house, we can use the Pythagorean theorem and some algebra. If we let x be the distance between Steve's house and Tim's house, then we know that the distance is a^2 + b^2 = c^2. So let x = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 4ac). For x, the distance from Steve's house to Tim's house is sqrt(4x^2 + 8x - 4ac) = sqrt(16 + 8) = 5.
