{"id": 212, "problem": "Gary likes to walk around the edge of the local park, which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles\nThen find the length of the two short sides of the park: 1.5 miles * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 miles\nThen add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles\nThen divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours\n#### 5", "gold_answer": "5"}
