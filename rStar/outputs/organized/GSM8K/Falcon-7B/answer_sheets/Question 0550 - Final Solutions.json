If Daniel wants to buy five notebooks, 5 x $1.50 is $7.50. Two pens at $0.25 each is $1.00. One calculator at $12 is $1.50. The calculator and calculator case cost $2.50 each, so $2.50 + $2.50 is $5.00. Two items have a discount of $3.00 each, so Daniel has to spend $3.00 + $3.00 = $6.00 on these items. Two notebooks at $1.50 each is $3.00. Two pens at $0.25 each is $1.00. One calculator at $12 is $1.50. So Daniel has to spend $3 + $1 + $1 + $1.50 = $8.50 on these items. The calculator and calculator case cost $5 each, so $5 + $5 is $10. Therefore, Daniel has to spend $8 + $10 =", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A shop sells school supplies.
