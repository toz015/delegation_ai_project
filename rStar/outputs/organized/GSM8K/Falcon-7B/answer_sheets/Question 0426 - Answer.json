{"id": 426, "problem": "Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of the price of the bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.\nSo the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.\nThe cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.\nAleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.\n#### 11", "gold_answer": "11"}
