{"id": 292, "problem": "Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for half an hour, how much money does she earn for the online task?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.\nSo she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes\nShe earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.\n#### 75", "gold_answer": "75"}
