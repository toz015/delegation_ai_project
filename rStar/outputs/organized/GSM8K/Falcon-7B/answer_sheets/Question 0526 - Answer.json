{"id": 526, "problem": "Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.\nSo, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.\nAda's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.\nSo her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.\nAda's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147\nTherefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.\n#### 21", "gold_answer": "21"}
