Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, and 4 apples that cost $1.50 each. So the total cost of the meal is 12 + (3 x 3) + $1.50 = $14. For each pizza, it costs $8. So the total cost of the pizzas is $8 * $8 = $64. To find the answer to the third question, let's think step by step. Let the total cost of the pizza and milk be $48. Then we have to subtract the cost of the chicken meal, which is $14. So the answer is: $48 - $14 = $34. For the final question, let the total cost of the pizza and milk be $48. Then we have to subtract the cost of the apple (let the cost be $1). So the answer is: $48 - $1 = $47.
