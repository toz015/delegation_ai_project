{"id": 259, "problem": "Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.\nThe total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96\nJamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.\nAndrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.\nThere are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.\nAltogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits\n#### 168", "gold_answer": "168"}
