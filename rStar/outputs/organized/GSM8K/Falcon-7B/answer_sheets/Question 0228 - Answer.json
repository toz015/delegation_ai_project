{"id": 228, "problem": "Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.  How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2\nOn average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6\nIt will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60\nIt will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1\n#### 1", "gold_answer": "1"}
