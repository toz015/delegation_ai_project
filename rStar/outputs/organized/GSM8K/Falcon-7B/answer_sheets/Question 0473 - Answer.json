{"id": 473, "problem": "Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
