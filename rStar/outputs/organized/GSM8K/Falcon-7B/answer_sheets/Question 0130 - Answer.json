{"id": 130, "problem": "Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How many elves are left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.\nThen subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.\nThen subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.\n#### 30", "gold_answer": "30"}
