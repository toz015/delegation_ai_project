{"id": 541, "problem": "Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y\nSince y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half\nApril has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125\nSolving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125\n45y/2 = $1125\ny = $1125*(2/45)\ny = $<<50=50>>50\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
