{"id": 355, "problem": "There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet, and the second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.\nThus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.\nTherefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.\n#### 34", "gold_answer": "34"}
