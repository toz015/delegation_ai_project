When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and now has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.\nHe had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 \u2013 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year\u2019s amount.\nTherefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.\n#### 50", "gold_answer": "50"}
