{"id": 564, "problem": "In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.\nSo, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.\nIn the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.\nTherefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.\n#### 240", "gold_answer": "240"}
