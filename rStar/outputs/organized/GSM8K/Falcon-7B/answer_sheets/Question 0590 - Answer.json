{"id": 590, "problem": "Alex is getting ready to attend an event that she has hosted and wants to make sure that she has enough seats for everyone. She invites 100 people via email and each invited person says that they will also invite 2 of their friends. She then calls 10 of her friends to invite them too and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses. How many seats will Alex need?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.\nSince 100 people were emailed, this creates a total of 3 * 100 = <<3*100=300>>300 people.\nOut of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.\nIncluding her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.\n#### 319", "gold_answer": "319"}
