{"id": 173, "problem": "Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month\nThen multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month\nAdd that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month\nNow multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year\n#### 18000", "gold_answer": "18000"}
