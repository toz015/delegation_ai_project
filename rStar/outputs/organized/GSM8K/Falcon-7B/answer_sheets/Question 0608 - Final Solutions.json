To calculate this, let's identify the cost of each piece of clothing. The shirt costs $25, and the shorts cost $35. The total cost of the shirt and shorts is then:\n\nShirt (S): $25 + $25 = $50.\nShorts (SH): $35 + $35 = $70.\n\nTo find the total cost of the outfit, we can multiply the costs of each piece of clothing. The shirt and shorts together are:\n\nShirt + SH = $50.\n\nShorts + Shirt = $70.\n\nSo, the total cost of the outfit is:\n\nSH + $50 = $110.\n\nThe answer is: $110.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip.
