{"id": 226, "problem": "James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type\nThen find the final number of water type Pokemon: 40 water type - 8 water type = <<40-8=32>>32 water type\nThen add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon\nThen divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%\n#### 33", "gold_answer": "33"}
