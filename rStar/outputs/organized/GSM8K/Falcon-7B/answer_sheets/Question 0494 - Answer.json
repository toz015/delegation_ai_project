{"id": 494, "problem": "9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64\" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60\" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "All but one cheerleader is 64\" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192\" tall\nThe shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60\" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252\" tall\n12\" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252\" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall\n#### 21", "gold_answer": "21"}
