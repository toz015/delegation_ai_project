{"id": 341, "problem": "A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.\nThe pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.\nIf you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.\nThe pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.\nAll the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds\nIf the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds\n#### 260", "gold_answer": "260"}
