{"id": 244, "problem": "Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.  Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.\nBilly took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.\nColby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.\nIf we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27\nThus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
