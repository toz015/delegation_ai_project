{"id": 354, "problem": "Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Subtracting Annabelle\u2019s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 \u2013 $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.\nFrom her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.\nFrom her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.\nShe therefore still needs to save $320 \u2013 $200 \u2013 $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.\n#### 45", "gold_answer": "45"}
