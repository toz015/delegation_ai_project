The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many stitches does the collar take?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Terri has 900 + 900 = 1800 stitches in the body. And since the collar is 10% of that, it is 1800 x 10 = 18000 stitches. And we have 18000 + 18000 = 36000 stitches in the collar. So the collar is 36000 + 36000 = 720000 stitches. And since the rosette is twice as many, it is 36000 + 36000 = 720000 + 360000 = 1360000 stitches. So the collar is 1360000 + 360000 = 136360000 stitches. The collar is 136360000 + 900000 = 136360000 + 126000 = 172000000 stitches. So the answer is: 172000000.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many stitches does each sleeve take?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step again. The sleeve has 900 + 900 = 1800 stitches. And since it's an 1800-stitch project, it is 1800 stitches in the sleeve. So the sleeve is 1800 + 1800 = 3600 stitches. The sleeve has 3600 stitches in it.

And the collar is 720360000 + 900000 = 720360000 + 900000 = 136360000 stitches. So the answer is 136360000 + 900000 = 136360000 + 126000 = 172000000 stitches.
