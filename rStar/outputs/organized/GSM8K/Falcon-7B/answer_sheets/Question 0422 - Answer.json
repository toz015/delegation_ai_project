He got a special introductory deal where the first 6 months were $8 a month, then it went up to the normal price of $12 a month. After 8 months of the normal rate, the service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.\nHe has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.\nHe pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.\nHe pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.\nHe pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.\nOver two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.\n#### 284", "gold_answer": "284"}
