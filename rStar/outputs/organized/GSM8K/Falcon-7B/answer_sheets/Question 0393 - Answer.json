What percentage of her total work time did she spend editing?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes\nThen find how long she spent recording the song: 240 minutes / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 minutes\nThen add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 \u200bminutes\nThen divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
