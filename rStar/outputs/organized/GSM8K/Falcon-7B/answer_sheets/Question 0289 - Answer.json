{"id": 289, "problem": "A car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. A car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. If the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles, calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.\nTo travel 480 miles, the car in the slow lane traveling at 30 miles per hour will take 480/30 = <<480/30=16>>16 hours\n#### 16", "gold_answer": "16"}
