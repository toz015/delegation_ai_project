{"id": 210, "problem": "Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them. Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.\nSara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.\nSara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.\nBetween her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.\nSara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.\nSara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
