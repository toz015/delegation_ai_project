{"id": 445, "problem": "Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16\nThe horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8\nThe hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24\nMichael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30\nMichael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6\n#### 6", "gold_answer": "6"}
