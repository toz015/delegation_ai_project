{"id": 453, "problem": "Jenna starts out with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for two rubies. If sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200, how much money are all her jewels worth?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires\nThen multiply this number by the cost per sapphire to find the total cost of the sapphires: 5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $<<5*800=4000>>4000\nThen find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400\nThen amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400\n#### 6400", "gold_answer": "6400"}
