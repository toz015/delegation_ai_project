{"id": 167, "problem": "Seth is twice as old as Brooke. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke\u2019s age and 2x represents Seth\u2019s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.\nThen we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.\nAnd we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 \u2013 4.\nThen we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.\nWe find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke\u2019s age is 8.\nSeth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.\n#### 16", "gold_answer": "16"}
