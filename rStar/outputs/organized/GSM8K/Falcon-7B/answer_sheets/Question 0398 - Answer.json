{"id": 398, "problem": "Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes\nThen multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs\nThen subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs\nThen add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs\n#### 168", "gold_answer": "168"}
