Mary has 30 sheep. She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half every day. So she has 30 x 1 = 30 kg of milk every day. 30 + 2 = 32 kg of milk every day. 32 kg of milk * 2 days is 64 kg of milk. 64 kg of milk * 3 days is 192 kg of milk. So Mary collects 192 kg of milk every day. 192 + 8 = 200 kg of milk.
