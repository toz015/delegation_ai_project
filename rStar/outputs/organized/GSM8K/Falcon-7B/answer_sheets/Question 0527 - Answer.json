{"id": 527, "problem": "If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.\nSince five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.\nSince there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.\n#### 48", "gold_answer": "48"}
