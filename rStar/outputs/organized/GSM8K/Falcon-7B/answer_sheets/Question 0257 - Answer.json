{"id": 257, "problem": "Each solid 10-foot section of a redwood tree weighs 400 pounds. Termites ate 30% of this redwood's wood. If the redwood is 200 feet tall, how much does it weigh?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections\nThen multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds\nThen find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds\nThen subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds\n#### 5600", "gold_answer": "5600"}
