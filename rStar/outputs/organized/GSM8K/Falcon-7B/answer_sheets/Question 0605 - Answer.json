{"id": 605, "problem": "For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup.  How much money did Patrick earn, in dollars, from selling lemonade for 6 hours?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.\nSo for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.\nHe earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.\nSo for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nTherefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.\n#### 42", "gold_answer": "42"}
