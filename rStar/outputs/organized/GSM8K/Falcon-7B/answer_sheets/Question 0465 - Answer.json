{"id": 465, "problem": "Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, and she loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.\nAnd, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.\nThus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.\nShe gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.\nTherefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.\n#### 30", "gold_answer": "30"}
