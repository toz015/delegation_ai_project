First, we need to know how many sheep Charleston and Seattle have together. Let's call the number of sheep in Charleston \"x\". And let's call the number of sheep in Seattle \"y\". Then we can calculate the number of sheep in the two cities together like this:\nx + y = 2(x + y)\n2(x + y) = 2x + 2y\n2x = 2(x + y)\n2x = 4x + 2y\nx = 1/2y + 2\nx = 1/3y + 2\nx = 1/5y + 2\nx = 1/10y + 2\nx = 2\ny = 2\n\nSo Charleston has 2 x 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 sheep.
