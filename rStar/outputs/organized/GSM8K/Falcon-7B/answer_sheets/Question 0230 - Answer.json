{"id": 230, "problem": "Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.  Each car sells for $20,000.  He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them.  How much does he pay for everything?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000\nSo the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000\nSo the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000\nRegistration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000\nSo his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000\n#### 276,000", "gold_answer": "276,000"}
