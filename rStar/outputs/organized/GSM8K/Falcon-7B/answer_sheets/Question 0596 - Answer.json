{"id": 596, "problem": "George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500. He\u2019s already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.\nAdding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.\nSubtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.\nThis means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.\n#### 260", "gold_answer": "260"}
