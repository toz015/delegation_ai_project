The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad. So if he spent $100 on each newspaper ad, he would have spent $100 * 50 = $5000 on newspaper ads. $5000 * 15 = $75000 is the answer. The real estate agent spent $100 on each television ad. $100 * 15 = $1500 on television ads. $1500 * 2 = $3000 is the answer. $3000 + $1000 = $4000 is the real estate agent's total spent on ads. 4000 + 1000 = 5000 is the answer.
