{"id": 441, "problem": "Two sisters, Elizabeth and Margareth, bought beads. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, while Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more beads do one sister have than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.\nSo Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.\nMargareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.\nSo Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.\nTherefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.\n#### 80", "gold_answer": "80"}
