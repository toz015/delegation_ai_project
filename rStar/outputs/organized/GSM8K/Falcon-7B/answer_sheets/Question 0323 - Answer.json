{"id": 323, "problem": "Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon\u2019s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Shannon\u2019s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.\nThe ice makes the coffee 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 milliliters weaker.\nAfter adding cream, Shannon\u2019s iced coffee is 60 + 15 = <<60+15=75>>75 milliliters weaker.\n#### 75", "gold_answer": "75"}
