{"id": 597, "problem": "The three angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. What is the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, in degrees?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x be the measure of the smallest angle\nx+2x+3x=180\n6x=180\nx=<<30=30>>30\nThen the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.\n#### 90", "gold_answer": "90"}
