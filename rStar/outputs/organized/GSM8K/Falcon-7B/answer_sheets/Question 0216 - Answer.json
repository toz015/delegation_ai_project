{"id": 216, "problem": "Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. If she is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, how much will be Janeth's remaining balance by then?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.\nSo she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.\nJaneth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.\nHence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.\n#### 220", "gold_answer": "220"}
