{"id": 408, "problem": "Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5\nIt will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30\nHe will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40\nHe will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
