{"id": 267, "problem": "It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300\nSo it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up\nSo the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes\nSo it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken\nSo it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.\n#### 91", "gold_answer": "91"}
