{"id": 580, "problem": "Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18\nThe oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%\nTherefore X + .04X = 520\nTherefore 1.04X = 520\nThe temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500\n#### 500", "gold_answer": "500"}
