{"id": 307, "problem": "Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.\nIn order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.\nTo find the number of weeks it will take, divide the number of pounds by the rate of weight loss: 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds/week = <<8/0.5=16>>16 weeks\n#### 16", "gold_answer": "16"}
