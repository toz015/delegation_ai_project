{"id": 361, "problem": "A train travels between 3 different cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  It does this trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip\nThe third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles\nSo the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles\nSo it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day\nSo it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
