{"id": 144, "problem": "Kim has started his own housekeeping business and is calculating how much profit he will make from his clients. He already has 3 clients, but is talking to another 5 potential clients and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. Each client\u2019s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. These are his only expenses. He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.\nEach week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.\nEach week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.\nThe bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.\nThe packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.\nSo each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.\nHis profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
