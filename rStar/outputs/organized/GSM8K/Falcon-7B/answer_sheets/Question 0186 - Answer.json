{"id": 186, "problem": "Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.\nBetween the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.\nAs the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw \u2013 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.\nSo in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.\nThis means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.\n#### 5", "gold_answer": "5"}
