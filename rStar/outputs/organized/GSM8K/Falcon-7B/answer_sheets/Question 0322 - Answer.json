{"id": 322, "problem": "Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils. If her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils, how many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.\nThus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 pencils.\nTogether, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = <<26+46=72>>72 pencils.\nTherefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
