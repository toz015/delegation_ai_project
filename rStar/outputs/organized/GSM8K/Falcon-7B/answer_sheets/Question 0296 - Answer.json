{"id": 296, "problem": "Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.\nSo, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.\nIn a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.\nThus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
