{"id": 279, "problem": "Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.\nIn 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.\nTo find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.\nWe distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.\nWe isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).\nWe simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.\nNow we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.\n#### 6", "gold_answer": "6"}
