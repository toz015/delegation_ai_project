{"id": 552, "problem": "A marketing company pays its employees on a commission-based salary system. If you sell goods worth $1000, you earn a 30% commission. Sales over $1000 get you an additional 10% commission. Calculate the amount of money Antonella earned if she sold goods worth $2500.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300\nSince goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.\nThis amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150\nIn total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450\n#### 450", "gold_answer": "450"}
