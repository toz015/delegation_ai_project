Jenny originally had 32 slices. 12 slices to Bill is 12/4 = 3. 1/3 of 3 is 1. 1/3 of 1 is 1/3. 32 - 1 = 31 slices. She gives 1/3 of 31 to Bill and 1/4 of 31 to Mark. 1/3 of 31 is 10 slices. 31 - 10 = 21 slices. She gave 1/4 of 21 to Mark. So she has 21 - 1 = 20 slices left. 20 slices - 1 = 19 slices left. The answer is: 19.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many slices does Bill get?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's continue our step-by-step calculation. 1/3 of 31 is 1. 10 slices = 1/3 * 31. So Bill has 31 - 10 = 21 slices. 21 slices is equal to 21 * 1/4 = 7 + 1 = 8 slices. Bill has 8 slices left. The answer is: 8.", "value": 0.25}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
