{"id": 450, "problem": "You can buy a movie super ticket for $20 that includes rights to watch any movie and you get one popcorn with a soda for only $1 extra. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21\nIf I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19\nIf the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4\n#### 4", "gold_answer": "4"}
