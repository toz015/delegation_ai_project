{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 40 - 20 = <<40-20=20>>20 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 pupils like green.\nThus, 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pupils like yellow.\n#### 15", "gold_answer": "15"}
