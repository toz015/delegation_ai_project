{"id": 411, "problem": "Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July.  He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much.  He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800\nSo the two packages were worth 400+800=$<<400+800=1200>>1200\nThat means he got a discount of 1200*.2=$<<1200*.2=240>>240\nSo the packages cost 1200-240=$<<1200-240=960>>960\nSo he spent a total of 960+150=$<<960+150=1110>>1110\n#### 1110", "gold_answer": "1110"}
