{"id": 446, "problem": "Rozanne is making eggnog for her family. She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases and another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. She puts out trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. If each glass needs 5 eggs, how many trays can Rozanne put out?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.\nShe therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.\nSo she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.\nThis means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
