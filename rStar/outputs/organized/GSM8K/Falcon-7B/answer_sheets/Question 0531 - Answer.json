{"id": 531, "problem": "48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.\nAfter the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.\nAt the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.\nAfter the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.\n#### 66", "gold_answer": "66"}
