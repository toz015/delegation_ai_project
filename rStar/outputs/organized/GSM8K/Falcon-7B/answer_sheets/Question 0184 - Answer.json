{"id": 184, "problem": "Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.\nThe chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.\nThe difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.\n#### 25", "gold_answer": "25"}
