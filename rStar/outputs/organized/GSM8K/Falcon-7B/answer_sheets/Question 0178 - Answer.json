{"id": 178, "problem": "Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.\nBo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.\nSince Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.\nTogether, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.\n#### 122", "gold_answer": "122"}
