{"id": 373, "problem": "A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000\nSince the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000\n#### 240000", "gold_answer": "240000"}
