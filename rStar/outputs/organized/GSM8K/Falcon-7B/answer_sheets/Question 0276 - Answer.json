How many of the cards had the letter D on them?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The number of cards with the letter A on them is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards.\nThere were 80-32 = <<80-32=48>>48 cards with no letter on them.\nHalf of the remaining cards had the letter B on them, a total of 1/2*48 = 24 cards.\nOut of the remaining cards, the number that did not have the letter B on them is 48-24 = <<48-24=24>>24\nIf 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them, there were 5/8*24 = <<5/8*24=15>>15 cards with the letter C on them.\nThe number of cards that had the letter D on them is 24-15 = <<24-15=9>>9\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
