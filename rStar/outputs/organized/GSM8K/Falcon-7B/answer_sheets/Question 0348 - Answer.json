{"id": 348, "problem": "A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per day now?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000\nThey now make 1,100 a day because 5 x 220 = <<5*220=1100>>1,100\nThey make 10% more per day because 1000 +(1000 x (X/100)) = 1,100 if X = 10\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
