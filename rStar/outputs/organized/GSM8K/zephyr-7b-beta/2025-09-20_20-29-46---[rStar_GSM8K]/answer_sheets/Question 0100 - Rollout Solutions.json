We can use this to find the number of presses from the third friend since we already know the presses from the fourth friend. Let's find the third friend's presses first. We can set up an equation using what we already know. Third friend's presses - Fourth friend's presses = 10. Substitute: Third friend's presses - (Third friend's presses - 40) = 10. Simplify: Two times Third friend's presses = 50. Divide both sides by 2: Third friend's presses = 25. Add all of the doorbell presses together: 20 (for the first", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
