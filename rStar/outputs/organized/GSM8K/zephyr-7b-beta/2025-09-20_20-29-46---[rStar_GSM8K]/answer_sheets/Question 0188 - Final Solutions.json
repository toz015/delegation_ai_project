The farmer sold these bags to the trader, so the farmer no longer has these bags. Therefore, the number of bags remaining with the farmer is 0. So, we don't need to consider this number.\n\nThe formula we just derived is called a system of equations since it relates the unknown variable (number of bags) to another known variable ($x$). We use this formula to find the value of the unknown variable when we know the value of the other variable ($x$). Since we know what the trader paid ($x$), we substitute it into our equation: $x = 20n$.\n\nIn this case, $x = $520. Substituting this into our equation, we get: $520 = 20n$.
