Distance divided by time gives us speed. So the speed of Blake is 100 yards / 900 seconds = 0.111 yards per second (yd/s). Similarly, the speed of Kelly is also 0.111 yd/s. Using this information, we can determine how far each runner goes in the contest. Blake goes back and forth 15 times, so he travels 1500 yards. We can write the distance travelled as distance = speed \u00d7 time. Applying this formula, Blake covers a distance of 900 seconds * 0.111 yards per second = 100 yards. Similarly, we can figure out how far Kelly travels. Kelly runs back and forth once, covering a distance of 100 yards, and then runs between the starting point and the 40-yard line 34 times. In other words, Kelly first covers a distance of 10", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

From condition 2, we know that Blake ran 1500 yards. From condition 3, we see that Kelly first runs once, which is equivalent to one complete trip between the starting point and the end of the football field (i.e., 100 yards). Then, Kelly makes 34 trips from the starting point to the 40-yard line and back. Each of these trips is 40 yards long, so in total, Kelly covers 34 * 40 = 1360 yards. Adding up Kelly's distances, we get 100 + 1360 = 1460 yards. Comparing this to Blake's distance, we find that Blake ran more than Kelly did. However, to determine how many more yards Blake ran, we need to subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance. Doing this, we find that Blake ran 1500 - 1460 = 40 more yards than Kelly.
