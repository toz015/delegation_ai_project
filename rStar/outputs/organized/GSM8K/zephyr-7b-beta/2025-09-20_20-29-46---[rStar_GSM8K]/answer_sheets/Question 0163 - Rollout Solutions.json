Since the cost of a doll is equal to the cost of three red cars and three action figures, then we have 3x = 5 * 5 = 25 (dollar). Also, we know that one action figure costs $5. So, let y be the cost of one action figure. Then, the total cost of all the toys is 5(x) + 3(y) + y = C, where C is the total cost of all the toys. Using the fact that the cost of a doll is equal to the cost of three red cars and three action figures, we obtain: 5(x) + 3(y) + y = 25 + 15(x) + 15(y), which leads to: 20(x) = -10(y). However, since we know that y > 0, then x must be negative, which is not possible because x is the cost of one toy. Therefore, our model fails, and there is no way to determine how much all the toys are worth. The answer is \"Undetermined\".", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?", "subanswer": {"text": "Our model fails, and there is no way to determine how much all the toys are worth.
