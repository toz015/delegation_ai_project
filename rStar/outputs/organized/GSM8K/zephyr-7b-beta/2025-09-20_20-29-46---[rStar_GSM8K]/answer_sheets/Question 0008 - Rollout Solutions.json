John drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he went 60*3=180 miles. Then he spent 2 hours stuck in traffic. After that, he drove at 30 miles per hour for 0.5 (half) of an hour. That would be 30 miles. Finally, he drove the rest of the 4 hours (i.e., 3.5 hours) at 80 miles per hour. To find out how many miles John drove in those 3.5 hours, we can use this formula: distance=rate*time. This means that John drove 80 miles per hour for 3.5 hours, so he went 80*3.5=280 miles. Adding up all of the miles traveled, we get: 180+0+30+280=490 miles. The answer is: 280.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
