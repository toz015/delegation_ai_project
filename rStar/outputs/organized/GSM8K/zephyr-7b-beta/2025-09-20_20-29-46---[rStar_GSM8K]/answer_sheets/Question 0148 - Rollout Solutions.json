According to condition 1, both Brittany and her mother went to the museum. Condition 2 tells us the prices of admission. Since we don't know who paid what, let's assume that Brittany's mother paid for herself and for Brittany. So her mother paid $12 (for herself) plus another $12 (for Brittany) for a total of $24. However, the condition about the change doesn't refer to both of them, but only to a single child ticket ($10) and a single adult ticket ($12). This means that the mother could have also purchased additional tickets for other people or for different events. Let's assume that the mother actually paid for the daughter's ticket as well. So she paid $12 (adult) and $12 (child) for a total of $24. But since we know from the third condition that the mother received $8 in change, it follows that the total amount she spent was $24 - $8 = $16. Therefore, the price of the adult ticket was $16 - $12 = $4. The answer is: $", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Using condition 3, we know that the mother received $8 in change. One child ticket costs $10 and one adult ticket costs $12, so the total cost of these two tickets would be $22. However, the mother paid the cashier a total of $24. It follows that there's a difference of $2 between the actual cost and what the mother paid. In order for the cashier to return $8 in change, the actual cost of the tickets must have been less than $22. Specifically, it was $20 (since $20 - $8 is exactly $12). So the mother bought a single child ticket for $10 and a single adult ticket for $10 (which is $2 less than the usual price), for a total cost of $20.
