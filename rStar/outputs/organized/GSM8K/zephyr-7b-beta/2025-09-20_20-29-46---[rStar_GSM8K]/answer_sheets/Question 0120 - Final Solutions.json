Each pad has multiple sheets, but we don't need to know that because we are asked about one week. In a week, Miguel uses 2 pads, or 2 * (number of sheets per pad) sheets. Since we don't know the number of sheets, let's say it's x. So we can write: 2 * x = number of sheets used in a week. Let's find x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = (number of sheets used in a week) / 2. Now, since we also know that Miguel uses this many sheets in a week, we can put the value of the number of sheets into our equation. We get: (number of sheets used in a week) / 2 = x. Substituting the known value for the number of sheets used in a week gives us: x = (2 * pads per week) sheets / 2. Simplifying: x = pads per week * sheets per pad. Using our original information about miguel, we can see that pads per week is 2 and sheets per pad is unknown. Let's call it x again", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Using our hint, we know that x sheets are used by miguel in one week. To find out how many sheets are used in one month (which has four weeks), we need to multiply the number of sheets per week by the number of weeks. So if we let y be the number of sheets used in one month, we can write: y = 4 * x. But we know x sheets per week as well! Using the hint to replace x with its formula, we get: y = 4 * (pads per week * sheets per pad). Factoring out the pads per week, we get: y = (4 * pads per week) * sheets per pad. This is very close to what we found earlier when we wrote: y = (sheets per pad * pads per week * 4). I hope you find these hints helpful!
