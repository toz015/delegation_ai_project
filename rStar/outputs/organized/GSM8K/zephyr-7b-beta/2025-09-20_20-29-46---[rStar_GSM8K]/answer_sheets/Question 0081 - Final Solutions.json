Nine stickers were given to his sister (Condition 3), leaving him with 33 - 9 = 24 stickers. Another twenty-eight stickers were used to decorate a greeting card (Condition 3), leaving him with 24 - 28 = -4 stickers. Since we can't have negative numbers of stickers, let's assume that all forty-two stickers were used up. Therefore, the answer would be zero stickers remaining in Charlie's possession (-4 + 28 = 24 = 0). However, since we cannot have a negative value for stickers, the answer should be: 24.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
