Since there are 14 remaining lollipops (28 lollipops minus the 2 lollipops she already ate), there will be 14/2 = 7 bags filled with two lollipops each.\n\nSo, in total, Jean will have packed 7 bags with 2 lollipops in each bag. That makes a total of 14 lollipops (the amount remaining after eating 2). Therefore, she still has 28 - 14 = 14 lollipops left over, which she didn't put into any bags yet.\n\nAdding up all the lollipops: The 7 bags (each with 2 lollipops) add up to 14 lollipops.
