During this time, he goes 8.57 miles (since it's the same number of miles per day). Therefore, we know that when John runs for 3 hours, he covers 8.57 miles. Since he runs at a certain rate (speed), we can find out how many miles per hour he runs using simple division: 8.57 miles / 3 hours = ~2.86 miles per hour. Now let's look at the second and third days, which are both half of what he runs the first day. Since he runs for half as much time, he runs half as far. Therefore, since John runs 8.57 miles the first day, he'll run half of that on the second and third days--or 4.29 miles. So on these days, John runs for 3 hours, covering 4.29 miles.

Therefore, his speed is 8.57 miles divided by 3 hours, or about 2.86 miles per hour. When John runs for less time (half of the time on the other two days) his speed will be greater because he's covering less distance in the same amount of time. However, if we calculate his average speed over the entire week (including all three days), his weekly mileage cancels out some of the extra distance covered during the shorter periods of time. Here's how we find his average speed: We take the total distance traveled (in miles) and divide it by the total amount of time spent running (in hours). In other words, we compute: Average Speed (miles/hour) = Total Distance Traveled (miles) / Total Time Spent Running (hours). To find John's average speed, we'll add up the miles he runs on all three days, then divide by the total time he spends running. The result should give us the average number of miles John travels per hour throughout the week. Let's do the math: 1. John runs 8.57 miles the first day; so, that's 8.57 miles for 3 hours. That works out to 2.86 miles per hour. 2. John runs half as many miles on the second and third days; let's call that distance x. Since x is half of 8.57, we can find x by multiplying 8.57 by 1/2. In other words, x = 8.57 / 2 = 4.29 miles. John runs for 3 hours on these days, so in total, we know he runs 7.56 miles during those two days combined. Breaking that down by individual day, he runs x miles for 3 hours on the second day, and the same x miles for another 3 hours on the third day. Since the total number of miles he runs on these two days is 7.56 miles, we can set up an equation to find x: x + x = 7.56 miles.
