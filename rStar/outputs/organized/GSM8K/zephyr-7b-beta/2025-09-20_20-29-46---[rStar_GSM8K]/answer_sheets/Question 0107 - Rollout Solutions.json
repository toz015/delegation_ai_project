We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV over the week. To find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we need to convert the time spent watching into episodes. Here's how:\n\n- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched one hour episode which is 60 mins.\n- Each episode lasts for 60 minutes and he watched one such episode on Monday & Tuesday => He watched 2 episodes of his favorite show (total duration: 120 minutes).\n- On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let's say he watched 'x' number of episodes. Since each episode is of 30 minutes, the total duration would be 'x' * 30 minutes.\n- On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a few episodes of a 30-minute show.
