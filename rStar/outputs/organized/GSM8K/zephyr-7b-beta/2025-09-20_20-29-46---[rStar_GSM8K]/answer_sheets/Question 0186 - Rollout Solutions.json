If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents. The problem states that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.", "2": "Count the number of straws given to rats and hamsters separately. For rats, as each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and there are no other animals apart from rats and hamsters getting straw, it means that for rats the number of pieces of straw given is the same as the number of rats multiplied by 6. Similarly, for hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. As all hamsters are kept alone, so we have to multiply the number of hamsters by 5."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that in total, 160 pieces of straw were given to the small rodents. 3 cages of rats and 10 cages of hamsters plus 20 pieces for the rabbits make up the total amount of straw given. Let's calculate how much straw was given to the rats first. Each rat got 6 pieces of straw, so if X is the number of rats in each cage, then X times 6 is the number of pieces of straw given to rats in one cage. That's X * 6. Now, we know how much straw is being given to the rats and hamsters. So, let's find out how many rats are in each cage. To find the number of rats in each cage, divide the number of pieces of straw given to rats by the number of straws given per rat. So, X * 6 / 6 is X. Here's the calculation: X * 6 / 6 = X. \n\nWe can eliminate X/X from this equation, because X/X is 1. This leaves us with X. X * 6 is the number", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
