Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters per hour and burns for 4 hours, it melts a total of 8 centimeters (as calculated in hint 2). Subtracting this from its original length, we get the final length. Let's say the initial length was x centimeters; then:\nx - 8 = x - 2 * 4 (initial length minus length that melted)\nSimplifying:\nx = 20 (the initial length was 20 cm)\nNow, let's find out how many centimeters have decreased after 4 hours of burning. We know that the remaining length will be the initial length minus the amount melted, so:\nRemaining length = Initial length - Total amount melted\nSubstituting the values found previously, we get:\nRemaining length = 20 cm - 8 cm = 12 cm\nThe answer is: The length of the candle has decreased by 8 centimeters after", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
