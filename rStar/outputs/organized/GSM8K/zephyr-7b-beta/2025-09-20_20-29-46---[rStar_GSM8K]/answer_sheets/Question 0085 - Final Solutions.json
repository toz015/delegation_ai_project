Using the hints above, we know that Gene makes one quilt block per shirt and 4 blocks during his first year. For each year since then, he also creates 4 blocks. So the total number of blocks made up until his current age (34) would be 1 * number of shirts used + 4 * number of vacations taken per year, from ages 23 through 34. 1 * (number of shirts used from age 23 to age 34) + 4 * (number of vacations from age 23 to age 34) is the total number of blocks made. Let's find out how many shirts he used. When he was 23, he didn't have enough shirts for blocks yet. That means we don't count any blocks from his first year. So we start counting blocks from when he was 24. Over those next ten years, he took 40 vacations, since he took four vacations per year. So he created 40 * 4 = 160 blocks.

During his first year (when he was 23), Gene made 4 blocks. During his second year, he also made 4 blocks, for a total of 8 blocks. Each following year, Gene again made 4 blocks. By his third year, Gene would have created 12 blocks (8 from years 1 & 2, plus 4 from year 3). This pattern continues until we reach year 34, which is the current year. During this final year, Gene would have created 4 blocks, for a grand total of 36 blocks (12 from years 1 through 33, and 4 from year 34). But wait! Gene turned 23 during his first year, meaning he completed 11 full years before starting his quilt project. To get the total number of blocks, we need to subtract the blocks he made during those 11 years from our running total. So let's adjust our calculation for those initial 11 years: Gene made 4 blocks during year 1, and no blocks during years 2 through 11.
