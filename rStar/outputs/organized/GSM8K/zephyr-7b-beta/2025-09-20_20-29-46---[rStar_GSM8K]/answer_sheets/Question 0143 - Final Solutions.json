We know how much food cost. Now let's figure out how much non-food items cost. Non-food items are light bulbs and cups, since the roach trap is already accounted for separately. Since there is a 10% tax on all non-food items, we need to calculate their price before taxes and then add 10%. Light bulbs cost 3 dollars. Cups also cost 3 dollars. Before taxes, they would cost 6 dollars altogether:\n\nlight bulbs: 3 dollars\ncups: 3 dollars\nTotal before taxes: 3 + 3 = 6 dollars\n\nNow we calculate how much these items would cost after taxes:\n\nlight bulbs + cups: (1 + 0.1) * 3 = 3.30 dollars\n\nThe total tax on these items is then:\n\n(1 + 0.1) * 3 = 3.30 dollars - 3 dollars = 0.30 dollars\n\nThis means that the total amount spent on non-food items was:\n\nbefore taxes + taxes = 6 dollars + 0.30 dollars =", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
