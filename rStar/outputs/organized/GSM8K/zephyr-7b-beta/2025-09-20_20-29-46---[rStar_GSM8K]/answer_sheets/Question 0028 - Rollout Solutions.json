There were 20 miles before Henry's first stop.", "2": "Find out how far Henry traveled between his first stop and his second stop. To calculate this, you need to know how far Henry traveled after his first stop before reaching his second stop. The problem gives us the distance between the end of the trip and Henry's second stop, which is 15 miles. Since we know that Henry has completed part of the journey by then, we can subtract the distance he has travelled since his first stop from the distance between the end of the trip and his second stop. Let's call this distance as x. Then Henry has travelled x miles since his first stop. This means that the remaining distance to reach the end of the trip is 60-x miles.
