Thus, the leftover amount is 0. So what happens if Cynthia finishes all ice cream from those four cartons by day 60? Well, she won't buy any ice cream during the next few days since she has no more ice cream to eat. Then on day 67 or something, she goes back to the store and buys another carton of ice cream. She starts eating ice cream again. During the time between day 60 and the next time she buys ice cream, she doesn't spend any money on ice cream.
