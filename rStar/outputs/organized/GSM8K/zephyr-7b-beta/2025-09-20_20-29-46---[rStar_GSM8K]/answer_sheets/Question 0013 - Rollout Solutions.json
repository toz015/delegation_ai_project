If we let x be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, then at the green house Melanie sold \u2154 x vacuum cleaners. That means, \u2154 x vacuum cleaners were sold at the green house. Also, since Melanie still has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can calculate how many vacuum cleaners she sold when she went to other houses as follows:\n\nnumber of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house = 2 more than what Melanie sold at the green house\nnumber of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house = half of what was left after selling vacuum cleaners at the green house and the red house.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie sold at the red house. Since Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners than the ones she sold at the green house, the equation would look like this:\n\nnumber of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house = \u2154 x + 2\n\nWhen Melanie went to the orange house, she sold half of what was left over after", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
