But after 60 days, she may not have finished all of the ice cream from those four cartons she bought earlier. Let's calculate how many servings of ice cream she still has from these 4 cartons. There are 15 servings in each carton, so together she has 60 servings. From day 1 to day 60, she eats 60 servings, so there should be zero servings left over. This doesn't make sense. However, we know that Cynthia eats one serving every night. That means she eats exactly one serving per night. This is important! Because of this, on the last night, she eats the last serving. Thus, the leftover amount is 0. So what happens if Cynthia finishes all ice cream from those four cartons by day 60? Well, she won't buy any ice cream during the next few days since she has no more ice cream to eat. Then on day 67 or something, she goes back to the store and buys another carton of ice cream. She starts eating ice cream again. During the time between day 60 and the next time she buys ice cream, she doesn't spend any money on ice cream. After she returns to the store to buy a new carton of ice cream, she pays another 4 dollars (for the next carton). This additional 4 dollars brings us up to our final answer. So let's add it all together: 16 dollars for the previous 60 days, plus nothing for the next few days, plus 4 dollars for the new carton of ice cream.
