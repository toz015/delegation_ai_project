Solving for x, we get: x = 0, which doesn't make sense, since Jim cannot read zero hours. Instead, let's try again, using the given information about the total amount of time spent by Jim over the course of four weeks. By combining the formulas found in Hint 1 and Hint 2, we obtain:\n\nTotal hours spent watching TV and reading = (number of TV-watching sessions)(number of hours spent watching TV during each session) + (number of reading sessions)(number of hours spent reading during each session)\n\nIn our case, the number of TV-watching sessions is equal to the number of reading sessions, because both activities happen three times a week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). The number of hours spent watching TV during each session is equal to 2 hours, whereas the number of hours spent reading during each session is equal to half the number of hours spent watching TV during that session (because Jim spends half as many hours reading as he does watching TV).
