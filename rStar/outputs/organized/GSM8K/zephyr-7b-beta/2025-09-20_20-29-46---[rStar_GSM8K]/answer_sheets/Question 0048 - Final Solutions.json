The answer is 48.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "We can find out how many pieces of wire Tracy created by finding out how many times 6 inches goes into 48 inches (the length of the original wire). The formula for finding out how many times one number goes into another is called division: divide the larger number by the smaller number. Let's use the expression: 48 \u00f7 6 = 8. Therefore, if the wire was cut into smaller pieces each measuring 6 inches, then Tracy would create a total of 8 such pieces.
