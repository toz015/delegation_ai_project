From condition 4, we know that the third friend pressed the doorbell 40 times more than the fourth friend, which makes the third friend press the doorbell a total of 100 times. That means the third friend pressed the doorbell 100 - 40 = 60 times, besides the fourth friend. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. Adding everything together, we get 20 + 30 + 60 + 60 = 150 doorbell rings. The answer is: 150.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
