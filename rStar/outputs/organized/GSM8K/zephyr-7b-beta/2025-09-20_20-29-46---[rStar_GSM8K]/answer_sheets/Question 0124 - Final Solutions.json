According to condition 3, we know that one-third of the unstamped letters are stamped by Jennie. Since there are originally 30 letters with pre-applied stamps (condition 2), this leaves us with 70 letters that need stamps. 30 of these are pre-stamped, so we have another 40 letters that do not have any stamps. 1/3 of these 40 letters get stamped by Jennie (condition 3). This means there will be 40 - 13 = 27 unstamped letters at the end of Jennie's work. We also know from condition 4 that there are now 30 stamped letters in the second pile. Adding these two numbers together gives us the total number of letters (unstamped + stamped) in the second pile after Jennie's work. So 27 unstamped + 30 stamped = 57 total letters in the second pile.
