When the text says 'two years ago Jean is x years old', 'x' stands for Jan's age two years ago. Using this fact, we can write down what happened two years ago with regard to Jean, Jan, and Mark. Jean's age two years ago was j - 2, Jan's age two years ago was x, and Mark's age two years ago was m - 2. Since Jean is older than Mark by two years, it follows that j - 2 > m - 2, or j > m + 2.

Using these facts, we can figure out how old Jean is right now ('the present') without having to go through all the steps again. At the present, Jean's age is still j, and Mark's age is still m. So the difference between Jean's age and Mark's age is still j - m, but now that difference is measured in terms of the present instead of two years ago. The difference j - m two years ago was the same as the difference j - m today, so j - m two years ago was also j - m minus two years. Adding two years to j - m gives us j - m plus 2, which equals the difference today because the difference hasn't changed. So j - m today = j - m plus 2.

Plugging this expression for m into the equation we just derived, 'j - m = j - m minus 2' or 'j - (j - 2) = j - m minus 2', we see that it simplifies to 'j = j - m', which is true but useless.

So, Jan's age two years earlier is J_2 = (Jan's Age) - 2. And Mark's age two years earlier is M_2 = (Mark's Age) - 2. At this point, we want to find out how many years ago was Jan's age when Mark's age was five years greater than Jan's age divided by two. Now, we have Mark's age two years earlier is M_2 = (Mark's Age) - 2, and Jan's age two years earlier is J_2 = (Jan's Age) - 2. As per second condition, Mark's age two years earlier was five years greater than Jan's age divided by two, so we get:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the age of Jean?", "subanswer": {"text": "We know that Jean is older than Mark by a time period equal to two years. Since we already found Mark's age, we can simply calculate Jean's age by adding two more years to Mark's age, which is M + 2. The answer is M + 2.", "value": 0.4375}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
