Similarly, by 3:00 PM it will be L - 4 cm, by 4:00 PM it will be L - 6 cm, and by 5:00 PM it will be L - 8 cm. The difference between these lengths is the amount it shrinks between those times.

However, we don't know what value L takes. The length of the candle at 1:00 PM is also unknown. Let's use some algebra to solve for the length at 1:00 PM when we know that at 5:00 PM the length is L - 8 cm, and it has shrunk by 4 cm between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM. The formula for finding the distance traveled using velocity and time is Distance = Velocity * Time. In this case, velocity is a constant rate of shrinking. So we get (L - 4 cm) - (L - 8 cm) = 4 cm, which simplifies to -4 cm. Solving for L, we get L = 8 cm + 4 cm = 12 cm. The difference between 12 cm and the length of the candle at 5:00 PM is the amount it shrunk from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The length of the candle at 5:00 PM is L - 8 cm, so the answer is: L - 8 cm - 12 cm = -4 cm, or equivalently, 4 cm shorter at 5:00 PM compared to its length at 1:00 PM.
