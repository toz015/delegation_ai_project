So the total cost for these boards now is $15 per board times 10 boards = $150 for these boards. Let's calculate the Condition 2 costs similarly. Before price increase, 5 boards at $16 each for a total of $80. After price increase, the new cost per board would be 1.5 times the original cost, or $24. So the total cost for these boards now is $24 per board times 5 boards = $120 for these boards. Adding those totals together, Sasha's total expense for both types of boards after the price increase is $150 plus $120, which equals $270.

Let's focus on those two types separately.\n\nFor the first type of board: \n\nOriginally, Sasha paid $10 for each board. Each board measures 2 cubic feet. Let's call this price per cubic foot p1. So Sasha paid p1 * 2 = $20 per cubic foot. Prices went up 50%, so new price is p1 * 1.5 = $15. New cost for all boards is $15 * 10 = $150.\n\nAfter selling these boards, let's assume Sasha sells them for q1 dollars per cubic foot.
