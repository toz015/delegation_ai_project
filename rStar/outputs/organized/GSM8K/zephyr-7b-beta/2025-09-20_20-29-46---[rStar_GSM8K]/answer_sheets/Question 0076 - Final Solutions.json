Let's calculate how many bags Cecilia would need for 6 months. 2 * 180 = 360 cups. Each bag contains 110 cups, so we need to divide it by 110. 360 / 110 = 3.27.

Cecilia bought a puppy, so she needs to follow conditions 2 and 3. During the first 180 days, she needs to feed 1 cup per day, which is 1 cup times 180 days, or 180 cups in total. Then after 180 days, she needs to feed 2 cups per day. Since there are 365 days in a year, let's calculate how many bags Cecilia needs after the first 180 days. To find out how many days it takes to go through one bag, we divide 110 cups by 2 cups per day. That's 110 divided by 2, which is 55 days per bag. So Cecilia uses approximately 55*2 = 110 days worth of food in the second half of the year. She used 180 cups in the first half, so in total she needs 180 + 110 * 2 = 360 cups.
