To calculate the time it takes for Tom's return journey, we need to figure out how far he travels during this time. During his return voyage, Tom travels at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Using the formula distance = rate * time, and knowing that Tom traveled 30 miles during his original voyage, we can say that rate = distance / time. This gives us rate for the first leg of Tom's trip as 30 miles / 3 hours = 10 miles per hour. For his second, shorter leg, we know that he travels 6 miles per hour, so let's call the length of time for this leg T. Using the same formula for distance, we get distance = rate * time. Substituting into the formula, we get 6 miles per hour times T equals whatever distance remains to be traveled once Tom completes his first voyage (this is called the complement). Since he traveled 30 miles in three hours during his initial trip, the complement of that 30 miles is 30 miles minus the distance Tom traveled during those three hours (call this remaining distance R). Therefore, we have 6 miles per hour times T equals", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 5}]
