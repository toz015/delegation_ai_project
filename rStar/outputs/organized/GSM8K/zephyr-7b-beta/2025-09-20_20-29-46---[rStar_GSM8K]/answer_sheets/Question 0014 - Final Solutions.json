But Y is the number of students in hip hop dance, and X is the number of students in contemporary dance. Thus, the remaining number of students should be the difference between the total class size of 20 and the sum of students in contemporary dance and hip hop dance. Using our equations for X and Y, let's find it: Remaining_students = 20 - X - Y = 20 - X - X - 5 = 20 - 2X - 5. Simplifying: Remaining_students = 15 - X.
