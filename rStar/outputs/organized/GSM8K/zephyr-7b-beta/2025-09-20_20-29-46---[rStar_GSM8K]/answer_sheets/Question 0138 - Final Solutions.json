Next, let's find out how many questions Mark answered today. Since we know how many questions Mark encountered today (condition 3) and how many hours Mark had today (condition 4), we can use this information to determine how many questions Mark answered per hour today. Remember, Mark answered 5 questions per hour yesterday, but today, he answered them at a faster rate, completing 100 questions in just 6 hours (i.e., 16.67 questions per hour). So, we can say that Mark answered 16.67 questions per hour today for the first 2 hours.

The total number of questions Mark answered yesterday was therefore 40 + 35 = 75.\nNow let's figure out how many questions Mark answered today.

It turns out that Mark may have failed some, so let's say he answered X questions besides these 100.
