Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we need to figure out how far away Polly can throw the javelin without the sapphire gemstone. This is 400 feet. Now, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. Let x be the distance she can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. X is three times farther than before. 400 times 3 is x. 1200 feet = x. The answer is: 1200 feet.\n\nNow that we know how far away Polly can throw the javelin with the sapphire gemstone, we need to make sure she isn't too close to the dragon's breath. Remember, the distance the dragon can breathe is 1000 feet. Polly wants to stand as far away as possible while still being able to hit the dragon. We'll call this distance y. \n\nFirst let's draw a picture! Here's what our situation looks like:\n\n```\n                      ________________\n                     |                 |\n                     |              1000|", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
