Question:  How much did Jean ultimately pay for the required makeup services during the filming period?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Since Jean's makeup takes 6 hours per day, she needs 6 hours per day for 4 days in a week. So 6 * 4 = 24 hours per week. During the movie's 5-week length, Jean needs 24 * 5 weeks = 120 hours of makeup time. Each hour costs $250, so that's $250 * 120 hours = $30,00 for the makeup alone. With the discount, it's 90% of $30,00, or $27,000. So Jean's ultimate makeup cost is $27,000. However, we haven't yet accounted for any extra expenses related to the use of expensive products during the makeup process. Without further details about these expenses, we cannot determine their exact cost and therefore cannot accurately calculate Jean's overall payment. In summary, we know how much Jean paid for the makeup itself, but we don't know what other expenses (if any) may have affected her total bill.
