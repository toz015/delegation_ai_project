Shiela buys 5 cell phones at $150 each, so that costs $150*5=$750. Since the charges apply over three months, we can find out how much extra she has to pay due to interest using the formula: (principal) * (interest rate/100) * (number of months). Here principal is the cost of buying the phones, which was $750. The interest rate is 2%, or 0.02. Since it's a 3 month period, the number of months is 3. So her interest fee is: $750 * 0.02/100 * 3 = $18. That means the total cost for Shiela is: $750 + $18 = $768.
