Since he collects 2 peaches per minute, he would collect 2 peaches in one minute.

We simply count how many peaches he picks up over the course of the 180 minutes. We do this by finding the product of the number of peaches John collects per minute (which we already calculated to be 2) and the number of minutes (which we calculated to be 180): 2 times 180 equals 360 peaches.
