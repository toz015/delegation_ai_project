Our recommended daily intake of calories is 2000. We have already consumed 1800 calories today. If we consume more than 200 - 1800 = 200 calories from the chips, we will go over our daily limit. To find out how many servings we can consume, divide the remaining calories by the number of calories in a serving. 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left over. Since each serving contains 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to determine how many servings we can still consume. 200 / 250 = approximately 0.8 servings. Again, since we cannot have a fraction of a serving, we round down to 0 servings. Since we cannot eat any servings, we cannot eat any grams of chips either, because a serving is defined by weight.

So that would be 2000 - 1800 = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories. Next, find out how many servings fit within that 200-calorie range. One serving contains 250 calories, and each gram of chips has approximately 5 calories. Therefore, it takes approximately 50 grams of chips to contain 250 calories. Since one serving is 15 grams, it takes approximately 3.3 servings to contain 200 calories. In other words, if you divide the remaining calories (2000 - 1800) by the number of calories per gram (5), then multiply by the number of calories per serving (250), you get the number of servings that can be consumed without exceeding the daily limit. This calculation yields (2000 - 1800) / (5 * 250) = 3.3 servings. Finally, find out how many grams of chips are in those servings. Since there are 5 servings in the whole bag, and each serving is approximately 3.3 servings, the remaining servings (rounded down to the nearest integer) will be consumed, leaving behind the rest of the servings in the bag.
