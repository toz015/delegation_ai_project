However, since we don't know when the pens ran out of ink, it could mean either Ram combined ink from some empty pens before starting or Ram combined ink from some empty pens after running out of ink from his initial pens. Let's consider both cases. Case 1: Ram combined ink from five empty pens before starting. After doing this, Ram would still start with 25 pens (combined ink included) as we assumed earlier.

If we assume Case 1, then no pens run out of ink because we combined ink before starting, so all pens remain functional, and we already calculated that there would be 30 functional pens. In Case 2, we can deduce that if Ram runs out of ink from his initial stock of 25 pens, then there should be exactly 25 pens left after combining ink from five empty pens. This is because there were initially 25 pens, and we can use the combined ink to refill those pens. Therefore, we have exactly 25 functional pens when we run out of ink from our initial stock of pens. Combining this with Case 1, we can see that no matter what case happens, we'll always have a minimum of 25 functional pens. Since each pen can be refilled by combining ink from five empty pens, we can represent the relationship between pens and emptied pens with an equation: x = 5y, where x is the number of pens with ink and y is the number of emptied pens we combined ink from. We started with 25 pens, so initially, we have 25 = 5y. And we ended up with a minimum of 25 pens, so the final number of pens also equals 25 = 5z. Now let's connect these two equations together, i.e., 25 = 5y and 25 = 5z. Then we can get: z = y. This means the number of pens we end up with is equal to the number of emptied pens we combined ink from. Since we ended up with at least 25 pens (because of Case 1), and each pen was created from combining ink from five emptied pens, we can calculate that we combined ink from at least 25/5 = 5 emptied pens.
