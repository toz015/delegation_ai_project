Thus, we want to find the smallest value of y such that 50y >= 50. The smallest possible value of y is 100, since for y=100, 50y = 5000, which is greater than or equal to 50. This implies that if Jamal's photograph contains exactly 100 ducks, then Brittany's phone could store up to 5000 photographs. This would mean that Brittany's phone could store more than Jamal's phone, which contradicts our assumption that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Hence, our assumption that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is exactly 100 is not valid. Therefore, we have to assume that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is less than or equal to 100. In other words, 0 <= y <= 100. Substituting these values of y into the inequality 50y >= 50, we obtain 50y >= 50. Solving this inequality for y, we obtain y >= 1 (since y is an integer).
