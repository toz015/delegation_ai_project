Firstly, she still has the cards from the first month, so we add that number: 200 = (cards in month 1) + (cards in month 2 - 20). This means she collected x - 20 cards in the second month, where x is the number of cards she collected in the first month.

After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 3x cards. Since she had initially 20 cards, she has a total of 20 + 3x cards. We know that Elaine still has some cards from the beginning, so the equation becomes 20 + 3x = x + x*3 + 20*3. By separating the x values, we get 20 = 2x. Solving for x, we get x = 10.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards. In the first month, she collected 3 times as many, which is 3 * 20 = 60. At the beginning of the second month, she had 60 + 20 = 80 Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected 20 less than she did in the first month. So let's subtract 20 from what she collected in the first month (which was 60).

So we need to add up the number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first month and the second month, and then double it. We previously calculated the number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first month to be 60. In the second month, she collected 40 Pokemon cards. So, in total, she collected 60 + 40 = 100 Pokemon cards in the first two months. Double this value is 200 Pokemon cards. She also still has some Pokemon cards from before all this happened. Adding this into our equation, we get the total number of Pokemon cards she has now: 20 + 100 + 200 = 220 Pokemon cards."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Elaine originally had 20 Pokemon cards. After one month, she collected 3 times as many, which is 60. So now she had a total of 20 + 60 = 80 Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer Pokemon cards than the ones she collected in the first month. Since she collected 60 Pokemon cards in the first month, we can calculate how many she collected in the second month. 20 fewer means she collected 40 Pokemon cards in the second month, making her total in the second month 80 - 40 = 40 Pokemon cards. That brings her total up to 120 Pokemon cards. In the third month, she collected twice the number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first two months, which is 200 Pokemon cards (as calculated above).
