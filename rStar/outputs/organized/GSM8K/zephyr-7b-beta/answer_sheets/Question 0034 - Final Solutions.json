For simplicity, let's call the number of Raymond's jewels X. Half of Raymond's jewels would be X / 2. Therefore, A = S - 2 + X/2 + 5. Next, let's plug this expression for A into the equation for Siobhan. Since she has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, S = A - 2. Plugging this into our original equation for A, we get S = (S - 2 - 2) + X/2 + 5. This is a system of linear equations, which is equivalent to: S - 2 = X/2 + 5.
