According to condition 1, both Brittany and her mother went to the museum. Condition 2 tells us the prices of admission.

It follows that there's a difference of $2 between the actual cost and what the mother paid. In order for the cashier to return $8 in change, the actual cost of the tickets must have been less than $22. Specifically, it was $20 (since $20 - $8 is exactly $12). So the mother bought a single child ticket for $10 and a single adult ticket for $10 (which is $2 less than the usual price), for a total cost of $20.

According to condition 2, the price of admission for adults is $12 and the price of admission for children is $10. This shows us that the price for children is less than the price for adults by $2, which we write as $C = $10 and $A = $12. In general, this relation can be written as $C = $10 and $A = $12, where C represents the price for children and A represents the price for adults.
