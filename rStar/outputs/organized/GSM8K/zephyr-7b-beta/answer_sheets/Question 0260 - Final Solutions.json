Based on our calculations, we know that Carla uses 6 cups of flour to make 36 cookies. If she makes 30 cookies tomorrow, according to condition 1, we can determine the number of cups of flour required using the same method we used for the first batch. She needs 30 / 12 = 2.5 times as many cups of flour as she would need for one dozen. Therefore, she will need approximately 5 cups (rounded up) of flour to make those 30 cookies tomorrow. In total, Carla requires 6 cups of flour to make the 36 cookies she makes today, plus the approximately 5 cups of flour that she needs to make the 30 cookies she makes tomorrow. That adds up to approximately 11 cups of flour to make all of Carla's cookies today and tomorrow combined.

According to condition 1, we know that to make a dozen cookies, 2 cups of flour are needed. To make 36 cookies, we need 36 / 12 = 3 times as many cups of flour.

Using the same method as before, we know that for a dozen cookies, we need 2 cups of flour. Since Carla is making 30 cookies, we need 30 / 12 = 2.5 times as many cups of flour (rounded up). That's 2.5 * 2 = 5 cups of flour required for the 30 cookies. The total number of cups of flour Carla will use is the sum of the cups of flour used for the cookies made today and tomorrow.
