To find out how many grams of chips we can eat, we first calculate the number of servings we can have. Each serving weighs 60g and contains 250 calories. We divide the remaining calories (200) by the number of calories in one serving (250): approximately 0.8 servings. So we can eat approximately 0.8 servings, which amounts to approximately 60g * 0.8 servings = 48g of chips. That's the weight we can eat while still meeting our daily calorie target.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
