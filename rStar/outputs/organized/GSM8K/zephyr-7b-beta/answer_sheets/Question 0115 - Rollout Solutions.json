So she spent 10 * 10 = 100 dollars on those boards. And she paid 16 * 5 = 80 dollars for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. So she has already invested 100 + 80 = 180 dollars into these boards.\n\nAfter prices went up by 50%, the price of a 2 x 4 x 10 board is now 50% higher than before, which is 50% times the original price. So the new price is 50% times $10, or $15. And since the price for a 4 x 4 x 10 board increased by 50%, its price is now $24 instead of $16.\n\nTo calculate how much she gets when selling the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, we take into account how many boards she sold (which is how many she has left) and their current price. This gives us 10 * 1", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
