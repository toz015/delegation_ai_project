Let's find out the area of all levels first. There are four levels. So, the area of all levels is (number of squares on the first level) + (number of squares on the second level) + (number of squares on the third level) + (number of squares on the fourth level). The number of squares on the first level is given as 16 square feet, which gives us 16 square feet as our starting point. Following the same reasoning, we know that the number of squares on the second level is half the size of the number of squares on the first level, i.e., 8 square feet. For the third level, it's once again half the area of the second level, which is 4 square feet. To calculate the area of all levels, add up the areas of all the levels. So, we get: 16 + 8 + 4 = 28 square feet. Finally, divide the total area of all levels by the total number of levels, which yields the average square footage per level. Hence, the average square footage of a single level on this sandcastle structure is 28 square feet divided by 4 levels, which is 7 square feet.
