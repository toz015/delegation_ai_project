One week contains seven days, and five persons in the household eat rice every lunch and dinner. So, each day five persons consume 5 * 0.2 kg = 1 kg of rice (in other words, they consume 1 kg of rice in total). In one week, each person thus consumes 7 * 1 kg = 7 kg of rice. Multiplying this by five (the number of people eating rice every meal), we get the total number of grams consumed by all those who eat rice every meal during one week. This is 7 * 5 * 1000 = 35000 grams (since 1 kg is equal to 1000 grams). Now, a 42 kg bag of rice has a mass of 42000 grams. Dividing the number of grams consumed weekly by the number of grams in the bag, we find out approximately how many weeks the bag will last: NumberOfWeeks = (TotalGramsConsumedPerWeek) / (MassInGramesOfBagOfRice) = (35000 grams) / (42000 grams) = 0.833333 weeks.
