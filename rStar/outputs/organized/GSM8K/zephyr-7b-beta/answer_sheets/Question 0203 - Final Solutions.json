So Carl used a total of '3x + 2x + 8*y' slices of cheese during the whole week. But what is the value of 'y'? Well, the problem doesn't tell us exactly how many nights Carl ate macaroni and cheese, but it does imply that macaroni and cheese lasted several nights, and since we assumed that Carl ate macaroni and cheese every night, we don't need to worry about the exact number of nights that macaroni and cheese lasted. All we need to know is that the number of slices of cheese Carl used for macaroni and cheese should be equal to or smaller than the number of slices of cheese Carl used for lunch. Now let's plug our findings back into our calculations and see if it makes sense. Let's say that 'y' is the number of nights that macaroni and cheese lasted. This would mean that Carl used '8*y' slices of cheese for dinner, which is less than or equal to the number of slices of cheese Carl used for lunch ('2x').
