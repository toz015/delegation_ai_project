If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we convert the change in speed for Gerald as a decimal: 0.1 (10%) increase. Let's call this value g. Lee was initially faster by 2 seconds, so Lee's initial time was 2 seconds faster than Gerald's time. After Gerald's improvement, let G represent Gerald's new time. We know Lee's time, L, is 38 seconds. Lee's time was also 2 seconds less than Gerald's original time, G0. To find Gerald's new time, G, you want to use the fact that Gerald's new time minus Lee's time is still 2 seconds. Here's what it looks like algebraically:\nG = L + 2; Lee's new time is L because his speed didn't change.\nG0 = L - 2; Gerald's original time is G0 because his speed didn't change.\nG = G0 * (1 + g); Gerald's new time, G, is found using the formula for compound interest, but in this case, it's for percentages of", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.
