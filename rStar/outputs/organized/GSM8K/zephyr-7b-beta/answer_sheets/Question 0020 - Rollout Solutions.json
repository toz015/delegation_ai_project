The original pineapple drink had a water content of 9 liters out of a total of 15 liters, or 60% water. Using these ratios, we calculate the water content of the resulting mixture:\n((9 liters of water from pineapple drink) + (66.7 liters of water from orange drink)) / ((15 liters of pineapple drink) - (1 liter of orange drink spilled)) = Water content of resulting mixture. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n(9 liters of water from pineapple drink) + (66.7 liters of water from orange drink) / ((15 liters of pine", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

So we can write this as:\n\n10 liters contains approximately 6.67 liters of water and 3.33 liters of orange drink.\n\nNow let's do the same thing for the pineapple drink: Three-fifths of 15 is approximately 9 liters of water, so the remaining two-fifths (about 4 liters) is pineapple drink.
