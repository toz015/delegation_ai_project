We want the common difference (d) to be zero since we are not transporting any additional bags beyond the original purchase. The second term (an) is found by adding the common difference (0) to the first term ($2$). An is $2$. Our expression would look like this: An = a + d * (n - 1). Using this formula, we can find the total amount spent on transportation for all bags purchased: T = \u2211(An) = $2 + 0 * (bags purchased - 1)$ = $2$ for each bag, so $T = $2 * (Bags Purchased)$ = $2b$.\n\nUsing the information we have about the trader's profits, we can set up an equation for the unknown: $30y = E$. Substituting the expressions we found for the earnings and transportation costs, we get: $30y = B * $20/bag + W * $30/bag - B * $", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
