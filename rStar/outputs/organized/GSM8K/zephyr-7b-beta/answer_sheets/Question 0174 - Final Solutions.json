Now let's calculate the number of seconds required for Billy to chop all of the potatoes using condition 3. Since Billy can chop a potato within just 5 seconds, we can use this information to find out the exact number of seconds needed for Billy to chop all of the potatoes. To do so, we first need to convert the number of potatoes from condition 1 into a whole number since Billy won't likely chop exactly 60 whole potatoes. Let's round it up to 60. Next, we calculate the number of seconds required for Billy to chop these 60 potatoes. One potato requires 5 seconds to chop, so we multiply it by 60.

To find out how long it takes Billy to peel all 60 potatoes, multiply the time per potato (1.5 minutes) by the number of potatoes (60).
