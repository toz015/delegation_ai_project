We know that there are three classes, and each class has 20 students. Let's call the number of girls in the third class x. The total number of girls in all classes is x + 15 + 12. And half of all students (girls + boys) are girls. If we let n be the total number of students (boys and girls), then there are n/2 girls and n/2 - n/2 = n/2 - n/2 boys (because it's still 50%). So x + 15 + 12 = (n/2 - n/2) * 3. Solve for x: x = (n/2 - n/2) * 3 - 15 - 12. Simplify: x = 3n/4 - 27/4. Since x, the number of girls in the third class, is a whole number, we can only choose values of n such that x is also a whole number.
