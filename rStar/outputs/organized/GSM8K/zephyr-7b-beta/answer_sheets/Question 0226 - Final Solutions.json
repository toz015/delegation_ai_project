Let's find out the new total number of cards after losing 8 water type cards and gaining 14 grass type cards. After losing 8 water type cards, we're left with 32 water type cards. We gained 14 grass type cards which brings us up to 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards. So, the new total number of cards is 32 + 34 = 66.\n\nNow that we know the new total number of cards, we can calculate the percentage chance. It's (number of water type cards / new total number of cards) * 100%. (32 / 66) * 100% = 48.46%.

After making the changes described, James has a total of 30 fire type cards, 40 water type cards, and 34 grass type cards. So there are a total of 104 cards. To find the percentage chance that a randomly selected card will be a water type, we need to find the fraction of water type cards compared to all cards.

So the formula is as follows:\n\npercentage chance = (number of water type cards) / (total number of cards) * 100%\n\nWe can now use this formula to determine the percentage chance.
