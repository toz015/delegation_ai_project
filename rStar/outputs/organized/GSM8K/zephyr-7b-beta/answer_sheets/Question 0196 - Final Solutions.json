If we add the number of pounds given to the restaurants to the number of pounds leftover (x pounds), we should get the total number of pounds given out (which we found earlier to be 200 pounds). To sum up, the number of pounds left unallocated plus the number of pounds given to the restaurants should equal the total number of pounds given out. Mathematically, this looks like: x pounds + 80 pounds = 200 pounds. Simplifying, we can find the number of pounds left unallocated: x pounds = 200 pounds - 80 pounds.
