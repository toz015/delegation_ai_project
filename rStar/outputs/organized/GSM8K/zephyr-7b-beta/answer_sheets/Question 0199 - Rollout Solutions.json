Similarly, the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B each week is his number of sentences from Publisher B multiplied by the rate Publisher B pays, or $10 from Publisher B each week. Step 5: Therefore, the total amount Mark makes each week is the sum of what he earns from both Publishers A and B. That is, he makes a total of $25 from Publisher A plus $100 (1000 sentences at 10 cents per sentence) from Publisher B, or a total of $125 each week in cents. The answer is 125.", "2": "Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we know that he edits 500 sentences per week for Publisher A and 500 sentences per week for Publisher B.", "3": "We can calculate how many sentences Mark edits overall each week by adding the number of sentences he edits for Publisher A and Publisher B. So, he edits a total of 500 sentences per week for Publisher A and 500 sentences per week for Publisher B, or a total of 1000 sentences each week."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice this amount, which is 10 cents per sentence. Each week, Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences. For Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 5 cents per sentence times 500 sentences, which equals $25 per week from Publisher A. For Publisher B, he earns 10 cents per sentence, so he makes 10 cents per sentence times 500 sentences, which equals $100 per week from Publisher B. Adding the earnings from both Publishers A and B, we get a total income of $125 per week in cents. The answer is 125.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
