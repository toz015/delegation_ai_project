That means her salary will be the sum of her original $7200 and 10% of that amount for each of the past three years. Let's call that amount x. Here's the equation:\n\n$7200 + (0.1) * ($7200 + x) * 3 = 7200 + 3x$\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = (-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) / 2a$\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 0, and c = -7200. Substitute these values into the formula:\n\n$x = (0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4(1)(-7200))) / 2(1)$\n\nSince b^2 - 4ac is negative, we cannot take the square root of it. This means that there is no real solution for x. However, since", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
