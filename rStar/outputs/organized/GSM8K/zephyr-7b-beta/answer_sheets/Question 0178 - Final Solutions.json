We know condition 2 says that Monic has fewer crabs than Bo, and condition 3 tells us that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Let's call the number of crabs Monic has \"x\". Then Bo has 40 crabs, and Rani has x + 10 more crabs. Since we want fewer than Bo, x < 40. Boosing x as small as possible while still meeting condition 2 (i.e., Monic having fewer crabs), we get x = 40 - 4 = 36. This means Rani has x + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. However, since we said earlier that Bo has 40, this would mean Rani has more crabs than Bo, which contradicts our initial conditions. So our assumption that x was as small as possible was wrong; x can't be 36. We need to find another value for x such that Monic still has fewer crabs than Bo but also satisfies condition 3.
