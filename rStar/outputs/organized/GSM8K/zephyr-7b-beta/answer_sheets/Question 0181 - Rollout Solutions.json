Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's say she ordered x white carnations. That means she ordered 4x red roses. Also, she ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which was 5 times the number of white carnations. So x * 5 is 200. Solve this equation for x. X * 5 = 200. Divide both sides by 5: x = 40.

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's call the number of white carnations w. This means that Sandra ordered four times this many red roses.

This means that Sandra ordered five times this many pink calla lilies. So we can write this as:\n\npink_calla_lilies = 5 * w\n\nNow let's add up the number of red roses and pink calla lilies. We don't know how many white carnations she ordered yet, but we can write this as:\n\ntotal = red_roses + pink_calla_lilies\n\nSubstituting our equations for red_roses and pink_calla_lilies:\n\ntotal = 4 * w + 5 * w\n\nSimplifying:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step again.
