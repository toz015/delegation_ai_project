Since one mile is equal to 5280 feet, we know that Tim travels 5280 / 264 = roughly 2 miles per minute when he skateboards. Since Tim lives 2 miles from the school, it takes him about 1 minute (2 miles divided by 2 miles per minute) to reach his house. Therefore, Tim arrives at his house later than Steve, but earlier than Steve plus a certain amount of time called the difference.

We know that Steve can bike at a rate of 440 feet per minute, which is equivalent to 7.33 feet per second (feet/second = minutes * 60 seconds/minute). Since we want to convert this to meters per second, we'll use a conversion factor of approximately 3.28 feet per meter (since one mile is about 1609 meters). Using these conversions, Steve can bike at a rate of about 2.28 meters per second (7.33 feet/second * 0.3048 meters/foot). Steve's distance from the school is 3 miles or 4828 meters. To find out how long it takes him to bike home, we divide the distance by the speed: 4828 / 2.28 = 2122 seconds, or approximately 35 minutes. Since the school is in the middle of their journey, we'll subtract half of their commuting time to find out how far Steve bikes from the school: 2122 seconds / 2 = 1061 seconds, or approximately 18", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Steve lives 3 miles from school, and he can bike at a rate of 2.28 meters per second. One mile is roughly 1609 meters. Therefore, Steve's distance from school is 4828 meters. It takes him approximately 35 minutes to bike home (2122 seconds / 60 seconds per minute), but let's assume they both start at the same time. That means Steve has already biked for 18 minutes, during which time he has gone 3656 meters (2.28 m/s * 18 min). The total distance from school to Steve's house is 4828 meters, so the remaining distance Steve needs to travel is 4828 meters - 3656 meters = 1172 meters. The answer is: 1172 meters.\n\nHint 2: How far does Tim need to go from school on his skateboard? Let's think step by step. We know that Tim's distance from the school is 2 miles or 3218 meters.
