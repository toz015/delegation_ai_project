After Ashlyn's first visit, we know that there are 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons remaining. These are subject to Condition 3, according to which three quarters (i.e., 0.75) of these become ripe. So we have leftover_ripe = 0.75 * remaining_watermelons. Substituting our value of 84 for the remaining_watermelons gives leftover_ripe = 0.75 * 84. The remaining watermelons are just what's left over when we subtract this from the original amount: unharvested = remaining_watermelons - leftover_ripe. Plugging in our expressions for both the leftover_ripe and remaining_watermelons gives us: unharvested = 84 - 0.75 * 84. Simplifying algebraically gives us: unharvested = 21.
