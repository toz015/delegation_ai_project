Let's find out. The number of games lost is: x - 8. We know that the team wins more games than it loses by eight. This condition tells us that x > x - 8 or x > 8. Thus, the team wins at least nine games. If the team won exactly nine games, then it would lose zero games. But this means that the number of games won would be less than the number of games played, which contradicts our first condition that says that the team plays 22 games in total. Therefore, the team wins more than nine games. If the team won exactly ten games, then it would lose one game. But this means that the number of games won would still be less than the number of games played, again contradicting our first condition. Therefore, the team wins more than ten games.

We can say this mathematically as follows: x > (x - 8) + 8. Simplifying it, we get that x > x - 8. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 2x > 8. Since the number of games played by the team cannot be negative or zero, we can say that both x and 22 - x (number of draws) must be positive integers. Thus, x >= 4 and 22 - x is also a positive integer. We know that the sum of the number of wins, losses, and draws is equal to the total number of games played. That is, x + (x - 8) + (22 - x) = 22.
