That means the second runner on the less well-rounded team (who is supposed to be 3 seconds faster) will need to run in 57 seconds. The third runner (another 3 seconds faster) will need to run in 54 seconds. And finally, the fourth runner (yet another 3 seconds faster) will need to run in 51 seconds. Let's find out how long it would take both teams to finish all four legs. Well, the well-rounded team finishes all four legs in 4 * 55 seconds = 220 seconds. The less well-rounded team finishes all four legs in (60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds) = 162 seconds. The difference is 220 - 162 = 58 seconds. So the well-rounded team wins by 58 seconds. The answer is: 58.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
