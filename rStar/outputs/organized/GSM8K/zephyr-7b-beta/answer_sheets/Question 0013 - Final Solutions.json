This implies 1 vacuum cleaner left after selling 1/3 of them, so 1 = (x - 1) / 3. Multiplying both sides by 3 yields 3 = x - 1. Adding 1 to both sides yields x = 4.

At the red house, she sells two additional vacuum cleaners, leaving 3 - 2 = 1 vacuum cleaner out of every 5. Since there are still some vacuum cleaners left, she started with more than one. Again, let x be the original number of vacuum cleaners. This implies 1 vacuum cleaner left after selling 2 additional vacuum cleaners, so 1 = (x - 2) / 5.

At the orange house, she sells half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, leaving 1 vacuum cleaner out of every 2. There are still some vacuum cleaners left, so she had more than one to begin with. Let y be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had left after the sales at the green house and the red house. This implies 1 vacuum cleaner left after selling half of y, so 1 = y / 2. Multiplying both sides by 2 yields 2 = y. Substituting y = 2 into the expression for y at the beginning of this paragraph, we find that x = 4, so Melanie started with 4 vacuum cleaners.

These answers coincide, since both lead us to the same value. If we take an average between these two values, we get 5. In general, if two results coincide, then the average between these results is also correct. In our case, the original number of vacuum cleaners must be between 4 and 7, inclusive. This is known as a closed interval. We use the midpoint formula, which takes the mean value between the endpoints of a closed interval, to find the exact value. The midpoint between 4 and 7 is 5, which means that Melanie started with exactly 5 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 5.", "value": 0.1875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
