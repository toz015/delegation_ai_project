First, we know that the price per gallon is $3.00. That means one gallon costs $3.00. Second, we know that the app company offers $.20 cashback per gallon. Third, we know that the customer buys 10 gallons. Using what we learned, here's how we can calculate the final cost, including cashback rewards:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount spent without any cashback: 10 gallons times $3.00 per gallon equals $30.00.\n\n2. Calculate the cashback rewards earned: 10 gallons times $.20 per gallon equals $2.00.\n\n3. Subtract the cashback rewards from the total amount spent: $30.00 - $2.00 equals $28.00.\n\nSo the final cost, including the cashback rewards, of the gas purchased by this customer is $28.00.
