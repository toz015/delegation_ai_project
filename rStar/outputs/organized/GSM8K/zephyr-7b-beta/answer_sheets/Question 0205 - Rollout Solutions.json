Notice that the first fraction involves five scores, while the second fraction involves six scores; this implies that one more score appears in the second fraction than in the first. Thus, when multiplying the top and bottom of the second fraction by 5, we eliminate this discrepancy: (89 * 5 + 71 * 5 + 92 * 5 + 100 * 5 + Z * 5) / 30 = (89 * 6 + 71 * 6 + 92 * 6 + 100 * 6 + X * 6) / 36.

Step 3: Use the rule for finding weighted averages to calculate the average for the first five scores (Brinley's grade point average without considering her last exam): It's easy to verify that the first term represents the percentage contribution of the first exam (89), and similarly for each of the other four exams. Since we want to know Brinley's grade point average including her last exam (Z), we need to compute the weighted average of all six scores: (89 * .2 + 71 * .2 + 92 * .2 + 100 * .2 + Z * .2) / .9 = 93. Step 4: Solve for Z: 0.9(89*0.2+71*0.2+92*0.2+100*0.2+z*0.2)=930.2 Therefore, z = 869 - 914.8 = 45.2 We round down since the decimal part is less than 0.5.
