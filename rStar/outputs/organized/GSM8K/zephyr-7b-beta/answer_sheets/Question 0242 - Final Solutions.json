At first, Mike had 5 pen pals who sent 2 letters each, which made 10 letters a week. Since he stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he now has 3 pen pals sending 2 letters each, which makes 6 letters a week.\n\nEach letter is 5 pages long, and one page takes 6 minutes to write, so a whole letter takes 30 minutes (5 pages * 6 minutes per page). So Mike spends 30 minutes writing each letter.\n\nMike responds in kind, meaning that if someone sends him a letter, he sends one back. Therefore, Mike spends 30 minutes writing each of his 6 weekly letters.\n\nTo calculate how many minutes Mike spends writing all of his letters in a week, we add up the time it takes for him to write each letter. This is 6 letters times 30 minutes each, or 180 minutes.

Let's think step by step. Firstly, Mike has 5 pen pals initially (Condition 1).

This is found in Question 5.2, where we calculated that Mike writes (4 * 2 * 5) = 40 pages each week. Next, we need to convert these pages into minutes. Since it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page (Condition 5), then it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page of letter. Similarly, it takes (4 * 2 * 5) = 40 pen pals to write (40 * 6) = 240 minutes each week (to write all their pages). Therefore, the total number of minutes that Mike devotes to letter writing during a typical week is the sum of the minutes that he devotes to writing his own replies and the minutes that his pen pals devote to writing their letters to him. From our calculations above, we know that Mike himself devotes (40 * 6) = 240 minutes each week to letter writing (as calculated in Question 5.2). We also know that his four pen pals collectively devote 240 minutes each week to writing their letters to him.

Using this information, we can find out how long it takes Mike to write all of the pages in a week's worth of letters. First, let's figure out how many pages Mike writes each week. There are 8 letters, each consisting of 5 pages, so Mike writes a total of 8 * 5 = 40 pages each week. Since it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, it takes him 6 * 40 = 240 minutes, or 4 hours, to write all of the pages in a week's worth of letters.

According to condition 3, each of Mike's four remaining pen pals sends him two letters each week, with each letter consisting of five pages. That means each pen pal sends him 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week. By condition 5, it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page. So, it takes each of Mike's pen pals (who can presumably type faster than Mike!) approximately 6 / 5 = 1.2 minutes to write one page. Since each pen pal sends him 10 pages per week, that works out to roughly 12 minutes per week for each pen pal's letter-writing time. But we need to divide this by 60 to convert to whole numbers of minutes; so roughly 2 minutes per week for each pen pal's letter-writing time.
