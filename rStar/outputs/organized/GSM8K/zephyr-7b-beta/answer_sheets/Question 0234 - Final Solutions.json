In a week, Steve will consume 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes, and his girlfriend will consume some number of tomatoes depending on how many vines Steve has. We want to find the value of n such that Steve's intake and his girlfriend's intake are roughly the same, so we solve our previous equation: x = 6 + n. The girlfriend consumes n/3 tomatoes per vine, per week, where n is the number of tomatoes produced by a single vine in a week. She consumes these vines' worth of tomatoes in addition to whatever portion of Steve's tomatoes she eats. Therefore, her weekly consumption of tomatoes is (n/3)(number of vines) + (6 + n) = (number of vines)/3*n + 6 + n. We set this equal to Steve's consumption, simplify, and solve for the number of vines: (number of vines)/3*n + 6 + n = 6 + n; therefore, (number of vines)/3*n = 0; thus, the number of vines required is (number of vines)/3 = 0, or equivalently, the number of vines required is zero! This makes no sense, since we're assuming that Steve is eating significantly more than his girlfriend, so we know he must need at least one vine. Based on this assumption, we can estimate that Steve needs more than 1 vine but less than 10 vines based on the following reasoning. At 1 vine, Steve's girlfriend would consume all of the tomatoes and he would consume nothing (this can be seen from the previous equations). At 10 vines, Steve's girlfriend would consume roughly 6 of those 30 tomatoes and Steve would still consume 6 tomatoes a day. Therefore, Steve's consumption of 42 tomatoes per week plus his girlfriend's consumption of 21 tomatoes per week adds up to roughly 63 tomatoes consumed per week.
