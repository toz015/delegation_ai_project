Juan and Carlos spent $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar for one gallon of lemonade. Each gallon makes 20 glasses. So per glass, they spend $(3 + 2) / 20 = $0.13 on lemons and sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50. So if they sold g glasses, they made $g * $0.50 = $0.25 * g dollars. Let's find out how many glasses they sold. Let's call that x. Then x / 20 is the number of gallons they sold. Since they spent $x/20 * (3+2) dollars on sugar, we have: $x/20 * (3+2) = ? We can solve this equation using algebra. Let's rearrange it to get $x$ alone:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{x}{20}(3+2) &= ? \\\\\nx(3+2) &= 20 * ? \\\\\nx &= \\frac{20 * ?}{3+2}\n\\end{align}\n$$", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Now, we can find out how many gallons they sold, let's see how many glasses they sold.

They made $25 in profit. If they sold x gallons of lemonade, then they sold 20x glasses of lemonade. This means that their revenue was 0.50 cents per glass times 20x gallons. 0.50 x 20x is their revenue. Their cost for sugar is spent at a rate of 10 glasses per dollar. Spent dollars on sugar times 10 glasses per dollar is their cost for sugar. Their cost for lemons was also spent at a fixed rate of $3 per gallon. Combining these costs, we have their total cost being the sum of their cost for sugar and lemons. Here's what we can write:\nRevenue = (0.50 dollars per glass) x (20 glasses per gallon) x (number of gallons sold)\nCost for sugar = (number of dollars spent on sugar) x (10 glasses per dollar)\nCost for lemons = (number of dollars spent on lemons) x ($3 per gallon)\nTotal cost = Cost for sugar + Cost for lemons\nProfit = Revenue - Total cost\nIf we", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
