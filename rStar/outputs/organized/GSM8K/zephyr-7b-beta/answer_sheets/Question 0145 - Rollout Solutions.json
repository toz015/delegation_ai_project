Secondly, we know that there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Thirdly, we know that it takes 3 months to harvest all of the pineapples. The time taken to harvest all of the pineapples in all of John's hectares would take 10 hectares multiplied by 100 pineapples per hectare divided by 3 months per hectare, which works out as 100 * 10 / 3 = 333.33 days or roughly 11 months (since we measure time in whole months). Therefore, John can harvest once in approximately 11 months. Since we can't harvest part of a month, the answer is actually just once in one calendar year (every 12 months) which would involve 12 * 100 * 10 / 3 = 4000 pineapples.
