We know the total population is 23786 people, and we also know the number of men and women. Let's find out the number of children.

Since the solution is x = 5548, there are no whole numbers satisfying this expression, which means that it's not possible to have so many women without some of them being both mothers and children! Therefore, the number of kids in Soda must be smaller than 5548 or larger than 7842 (which would result in a negative number of women). Based on this, we could guess that there are probably fewer than 5000 kids living in Soda. Hint 2: Think about plausibility.
