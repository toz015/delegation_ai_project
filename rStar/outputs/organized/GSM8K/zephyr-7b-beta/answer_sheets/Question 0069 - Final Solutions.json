At the beginning, Bailey has some amount of money (let's call it x). Each week, she gets $5 as allowance. After the first week, she has x + 5. Each week afterwards, she gets another $5, so after week 1, she has x + 5, then after week 2, she has x + 10, etc. After week 8, we get x + 5 + ... + 5 (eight times). Since we know the total amount of money bailey has after eight weeks is $100, we can write this equation: x + 5 + ... + 5 = 100. This is called a recurrence relation because we need to solve for x using the values from previous steps. We can use math tricks like substitution to simplify the expression. In this case, we can notice that adding 5 to both sides leads to: x = 95 - 5(8).
