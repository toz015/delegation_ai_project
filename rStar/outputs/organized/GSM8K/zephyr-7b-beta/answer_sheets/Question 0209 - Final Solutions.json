Since we know the cost for selling half a dozen plates, we can divide this price by two to get the price for one plate: 3000/2 = 15000 dollars. Finally, we know that the price difference between plates and cups is $1200, which means that the price of 20 dozens of cups is $1200 less than the price of half a dozen plates.
