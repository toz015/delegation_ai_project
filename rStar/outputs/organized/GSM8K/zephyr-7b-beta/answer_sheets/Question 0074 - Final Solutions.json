Therefore, when he sells one marigold pot, he earns $3. The answer is: 3.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Artie sells 12 marigold pots today, so his earnings from those sales is 12 times 3 dollars per pot, which is 36 dollars. Artie also sells 9 petunia pots, so his earnings from those sales is 9 times 1.87 dollars per pot, which is 16.83 dollars. Finally, Artie sells 17 begonia pots today, so his earnings from those sales is 17 times 2.12 dollars per pot, which is 35.94 dollars. Adding up all three earnings, we get 36 + 16.83 + 35.94 dollars, or 88.77 dollars. However, according to Condition 3, all prices are rounded to the nearest dollar, so we round our earnings to the nearest dollar as well. Our total earnings is therefore 88 dollars. The answer is: 88.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
