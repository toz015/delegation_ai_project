In other words, we can write Anne's rides as 0.7x and Mitchell's rides as 30 more rides than Anne's, so we can set up an equation for Mitchell's rides. 30 more rides than Anne's = 30 = x * 0.3 = 0.3x. Step 3: Robert traveled the slide four times as often as Anne did. This means if Anne rode the slide x times, then Robert would ride the slide four times as often as that, i.e., Robert rode the slide 4x times. Step 4: Combining the equations for Anne's and Mitchell's rides, we can find out the number of times Mitchell rode the water slide. We also know that Robert traveled the slide four times as often as Anne did, so we can calculate the number of times Robert rode the water slide as well. Step 5: From our calculations, we find that Mitchell rode the water slide exactly 90 times and Robert rode the water slide exactly 160 times.

Since Anne used the water slide fewer times than Mitchell by 30%, let's assume Anne rode the water slide 'x' times. Based on this, Mitchell would have ridden the water slide (x+30) times. Using condition 4, we can write a proportion: Anne : Mitchell :: Robert : (Anne's rides + 4*Anne's rides). Solving for 'Robert's rides' in this proportion, we get: Robert's rides = (Anne's rides)*(4+1) = (4/1)*(Anne's rides) = 4*(Anne's rides).
