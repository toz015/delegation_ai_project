This means that we have an alternating sequence of glasses, where we alternate between regular price and discounted price glasses. We can find the exact number of discounted price glasses in this alternating sequence using a formula based on finding the largest possible subsequence made of consecutive terms with different parities. Here's an explanation of how this formula works:\n\nWe know that we have 16 glasses in total, so there are an odd number of them, meaning that there will be an odd number of regular price glasses (odd-numbered indexes) and an odd number of discounted price glasses (even-numbered indexes).
