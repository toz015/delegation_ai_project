First, let's find out how much Marie spent on her chicken meal and milk. The chicken meal costs $12 and the five containers of milk cost $15 ($3 per container). That is a total of $27. Next, we add the amount she spent on the apples. Each apple is $1.50, so the total for all four apples is $6. Adding up these amounts, we get $33 as the sum of the first three conditions. We know that the total cost Marie paid is $50, which means we need to find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza. Since we already have the price of each box at $8.50, we can determine the number of boxes simply by dividing the remaining cost by the price of each box. Let's see: $50 minus $33 equals $17 for the pizza. Dividing $17 by $8.50 per box tells us that Marie ordered approximately 2 boxes of pizza (rounded down).
