We are trying to find out how much money Tommy makes just from selling brownies. Each brownie costs $3. Let's say Tommy sells X number of brownies. Then $3 times X equals the amount he makes from selling just brownies. $3$x$ = the amount. How can we find out what X is? Well, if he sold X brownies, he would have sold zero cheesecakes (because we're only considering brownies). But since we know how much he makes altogether, let's write down that equation again, but this time, include the fact that he also sells cheesecakes:\n\nMoney from brownies + Money from cheesecakes = Total money made\n\nNow, let's fill in our equations using what we know:\n\n$3$$x$ + $4$$y$ = Total money made\n\nWe know how much he makes altogether because we were told it.
