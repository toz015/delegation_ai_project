We can find out the number of Post-it notes that Candice has used up at the coffee shop by finding out how many Post-it notes she affixed onto each cup of coffee (let's say it's X Post-it notes per cup) and multiplying that by the total number of cups of coffee that she dealt with (i.e., 220 cups of coffee). The remaining Post-it notes, i.e., Candice_Remainder = Candice_AfterCoffeeShop - (X*220), are what we're looking for.
