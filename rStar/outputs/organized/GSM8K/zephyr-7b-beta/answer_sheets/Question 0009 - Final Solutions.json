Eliza's base hourly rate is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours each week. So for those 40 hours, she earned 40 * 10 = $400. For the remaining 5 hours, Eliza received an overtime rate of 1.2 times her base hourly rate ($12). So Eliza's overtime earnings were 5 * 12 = $60. Adding her base salary and overtime earnings together, Eliza made $400 + $60 = $460 this week. The answer is: $460.", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
