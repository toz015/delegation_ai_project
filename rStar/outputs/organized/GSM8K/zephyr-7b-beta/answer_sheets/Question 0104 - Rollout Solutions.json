To figure out how many pieces are left to be placed, we need to count all the pieces on the board and subtract them from the total number of pieces. Since we don't know exactly how many pieces are on the board, we just assume that all the pieces that haven't been placed yet are lying around. Then, we add these pieces to the ones on the board, and subtract the total number of pieces from the 1000 that we started with. So, the number of jigsaw pieces that are left to be placed is: 1000 minus the number of pieces on the board. Let's write this using a formula: Total Number Of Pieces - Number Of Pieces On Board = Number Of Pieces Left To Be Placed. Or, equivalently: Total Number Of Pieces = Number Of Pieces On Board + Number Of Pieces Left To Be Placed. Using our previous results: The total number of pieces is 1000, the number of pieces that are on the board is the sum of the number of pieces that Poppy and Poppy's mom placed, and the number of pieces left to be placed is what we're trying to find. So we can write this as an equation: 1000 = Poppy's Pieces + Mom's Pieces + Pieces Left To Be Placed. We found Poppy's pieces and Mom's pieces earlier, so we substitute those values into the equation above. That leaves us with: 1000 = (a quarter of the total number of pieces) + (a third of the remaining number of pieces) + Pieces Left To Be Placed. Since we want to find the number of pieces left to be placed, we solve this equation for that variable. I'll leave it to you as an exercise.
