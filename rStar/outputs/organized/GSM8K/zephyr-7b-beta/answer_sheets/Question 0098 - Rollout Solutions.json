We also know that during the second 15 minutes, another 20 cars passed by, which means that the total number of cars that passed by during the first and second 15 minute periods is equal to 'x' plus 20 (where 'x' is the number of cars that passed by during the first 15 minutes). But we also know that during the whole time, 5 cars exited the queue before reaching the traffic jam. This means that we need to subtract these 5 cars from the total number of cars that passed by during both periods. So, our equation looks like this: 'x' + 20 - 5 = 30.

Since all cars left eventually, the sum of the number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes (y) and the number of cars that didn't leave during the entire duration (x) should equal the initial number of cars (30). This leads us to another equation: y + x = 30. Combining these equations to get rid of x yields: 30 - y - 5 = y + 30 - y - 5, which simplifies to: -10 = -5y. We can divide both sides by -5 to obtain y: y = 2. This cannot be correct since the number of cars cannot be negative or fractional. However, we can use our knowledge that some of the cars drove through during the first 15 minutes and that 20 more cars drove through during the remaining 15 minutes to determine that some number of cars between 1 and 19 (inclusive) drove through during the first 15 minutes, but we don't know the exact value.
