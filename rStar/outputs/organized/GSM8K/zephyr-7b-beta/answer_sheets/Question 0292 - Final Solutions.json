Susan earned 5 dollars for every 10 minute segment she worked. Let's assume she earns q dollars per hour (q is the amount she earns per hour). 10 minutes is 0.1667 hours, or roughly 1/6th of an hour. In 1 hour, she would earn 5 times as much as she earns in 10 minutes (since she earns the same rate per time unit). So, we can say q = 0.1667 * 5 = 0.833 dollars per minute. Since Susan worked for 2.5 hours in total, she earned 2.5 hours worth of income. 2.5 hours is 2.5 * 60 minutes, or 150 minutes. 150 minutes times our per-minute earning rate gives us her total earnings for the task. 150 * 0.833 dollars per minute is 125 dollars.
