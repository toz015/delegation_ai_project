After spilling one liter, there are 23 liters left (24 - 1). Since we mixed the remaining orange drink with the pineapple drink, let's find out how much pineapple drink was used up. We can calculate this using the ratio of water in the pineapple drink and the total amount of drink. The ratio of water in the pineapple drink is three-fifths. This means that for every 5 liters of pineapple drink, 3 liters are water and 2 liters are juice. Let's multiply both sides of the ratio by 5 to get an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 5. Three-fifths becomes 3/5, so three liters of water are equivalent to 3/5 of 5 liters of drink. Now let's convert this back to liters of water.

From our second hint, the pineapple drink contained 9 liters of water in its original 15 liters.
