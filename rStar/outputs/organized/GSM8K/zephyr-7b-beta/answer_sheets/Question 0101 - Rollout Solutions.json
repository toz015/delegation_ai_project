Solo has to read pages from 4 books. Let's call these numbers x, y, z, and w, respectively. The total number of pages Solo needs to read is: (4 x x) + (20 x y) + (7 x z) + (8 x w). On Monday, Solo read a total of 15 pages. This means (4 x x) + (20 x y) + (7 x z) + (8 x w) = 15. We can solve this equation like any system of linear equations, but let's assume we know the number of pages solo needed to read from his science book (x), then we can find how many pages he read from his other textbooks.
