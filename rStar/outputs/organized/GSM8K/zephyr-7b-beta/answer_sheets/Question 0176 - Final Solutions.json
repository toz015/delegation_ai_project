First let's calculate how many Chinese people participated in the race (Condition 1).

To get this number, we combine the number of boys and the number of girls. But how many girls are there? To determine the number of girls, we need to find out how many people are left over when we take away the number of boys and the number of Chinese participants who are not part of the Chinese team.
