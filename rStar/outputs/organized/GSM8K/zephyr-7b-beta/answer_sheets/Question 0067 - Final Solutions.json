The number of rubies is less than the number of diamonds by exactly 35. So, the number of rubies, x, satisfies the inequality x < 175 / 2. Also, we have the condition that the difference in the number of rubies and diamonds is exactly 35. That means x - 175 mod 2 = -35. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can figure out that x = 100 (mod 130). The number of rubies is indeed an integer! Therefore, we get x = 100. Next, the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, the number of emeralds is 2*100 = 200.
