We cannot calculate the exact number of insects in the garden because the problem itself doesn't provide us enough information to determine a unique solution. However, based on the information provided, the number of insects in the garden should be somewhere around 1.31 petabytes (which is approximately half as many ants). Note: Since the maximum value of an integer is only a theoretical limit, the actual upper bound for the number of insects could be much smaller, depending on how many insects are actually present in the garden.\n\nAlternative approach: Let 'a' be the number of ants and 'b' be the number of bugs.

We don't know exactly how many bugs are in the garden, but we do know that there are fewer bugs than ants, and we know that the initial ant population is 50. Let's call the bug population x. Since there are fewer bugs than ants, we know that x is less than 50. Specifically, x could be any integer less than 50 (or it could be a decimal less than 50 if you prefer decimals instead of integers). Adding together the ant and bug populations gives us: Population of insects = Ant population + Bug population = 50 + x. So, the total count of insects present in the garden is equal to the sum of the ant and bug populations.

From condition 1, we can see that the number of bugs in the garden is less than the number of ants.

However, we can get the range of values for which the total count would lie.\n\nFrom condition 1, the number of bugs is less than the number of ants. Therefore, x should lie somewhere between zero and fifty. When x is zero, there are no bugs and the total count of insects would be 50 (initial population of ants).
