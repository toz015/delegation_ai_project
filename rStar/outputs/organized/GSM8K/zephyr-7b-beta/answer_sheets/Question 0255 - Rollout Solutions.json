Before, each of 10 stalls had 20 cows, so there were 200 cows altogether. Then Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows. Let's find out how many cows went into each of the original 20 stalls. We can use division to divide 200 (the total number of cows before) by 20 (the number of cows per stall). 200 divided by 20 equals 10 (rounded down). So, originally, each of the 20 stalls had 10 cows. Now we know that Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows, so there are still 200 cows, but some of them are from Mr. Sylas. That means that each of the original 20 stalls now has 10 cows plus some from Mr. Sylas. But how many?
