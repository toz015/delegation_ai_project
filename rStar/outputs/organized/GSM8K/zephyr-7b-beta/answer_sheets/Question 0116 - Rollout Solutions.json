In order to convert ratios into fractions, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of both numbers. Here, the LCM is 91 (7 * 13), so the fractional equivalent of the ratio would be 7/91 : 13/91. If Katy used x teaspoons of sugar and y cups of water, then their product would be 91 times some value, which is represented as x*y=91c. When they are divided by y, the result becomes x/y=91b/c. When they are divided by x, the result becomes y/x=91d/bc. Finally, if c is replaced with 1, the values would be b/d (or simply b/d, since the multiplication factor for both numerator and denominator is the same). This fraction represents the proportion of sugar per cup of water. To calculate how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used in relation to how many cups of water she used, we just replace b and d with the respective numbers. In this case, b=120 and d=120, so b/d=1 (since they both equal 120). Accordingly, the ratio for Katy's preparation would be 7 * 1 = 7 teaspoons of sugar per cup of water. This can also be verified by the fact that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar (b=120) and made 120/13 = 9.23 cups of water (d=923) in accordance with the overall ratio of 91 (7 * 13).
