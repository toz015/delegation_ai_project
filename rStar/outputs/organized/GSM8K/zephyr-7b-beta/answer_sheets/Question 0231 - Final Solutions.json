To find x on Tuesday, we know that Kylie will collect twice as many shells as she did on Monday. To get the number of shells she collected on Monday, substitute \"x\" in the equation we found earlier: 20 + 5 = x. Then multiply the equation for Tuesday by 2 to get the number she collected on Tuesday. This would look like: 2(2 times as many shells as she did on Monday) = 2(x).
