Now, since we also know that Miguel uses this many sheets in a week, we can put the value of the number of sheets into our equation. We get: (number of sheets used in a week) / 2 = x. Substituting the known value for the number of sheets used in a week gives us: x = (2 * pads per week) sheets / 2. Simplifying: x = pads per week * sheets per pad.
