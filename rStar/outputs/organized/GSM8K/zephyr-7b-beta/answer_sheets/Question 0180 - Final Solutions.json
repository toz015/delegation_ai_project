First, we know that the winning candidate received 3/4 of all the votes casted. We also know that a total of 80 students participated in the vote. So if the winner got 3/4 of all those votes, how many votes would that be? To find out, we can set up an equation: \n\nWinner Votes = 3/4 * Total Votes\n\nSubstituting the values we know into the equation, we get:\n\nWinner Votes = 3/4 * 80\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4/3, we can convert the decimal fraction to a mixed number:\n\n(4/3) * Winner Votes = 240\n\nDividing both sides by 4 and converting the mixed number back into a decimal fraction, we get:\n\nWinner Votes = 60\n\nSo the winning candidate got 60 votes. That leaves us with the question of how many votes the other candidate, who didn't win, got. Since we know that 80 students voted, and the winner got 60 votes, that leaves 20 unaccounted", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
