Let's call Zaid's monthly salary S. The part spent on rent is \u00bc of S, so it is S / 4. The part spent on car fuel is \u2153 of S \u2013 S / 4, which is (S / 3) - (S / 12). The remainder is S \u2013 S / 4 \u2013 (S / 3) + (S / 12), which is (2S / 12). Of this remainder, he donates half, so (S / 12) / 2 is what he donates to his favorite charity. And we know that he donates $700 to his wife every month, which is 700 / (S / 12) times what he donates to his favorite charity. Combining these two equations, we get: (S / 12) / 2 = 700 / ((S / 12) + (S / 3)) We can simplify this expression as follows: (S / 12) / 2 = (3)(700) / (S + (3)(S))) We're almost", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "How much money will Zaid still have after all these expenses and donations?", "subanswer": {"text": "Zaid earns 6000 dollars per month.

Since he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, we know that's equivalent to 1500$. 1/4 of 6000$ is 1500$. Next, let's find out how much Zaid spends on car fuel. We know that Zaid spends 1/3 of the money he has left over from rent on car fuel. So we subtract the amount he spent on rent to get the rest of his income, and then we take 1/3 of that. So Zaid spends (3/12) * (6000 - 1500) or 1000$ on car fuel. Next, we find how much Zaid donates to his favorite charity. This is half of what's left over after rent and car fuel.
