Twice this amount is ordered for 2 months. So we have 2xy bananas ordered every 2 months. But since we said that xy bananas are eaten in one month, it follows that xy bananas are also eaten in half a month (i.e., every 2 months). This means that xy/2 bananas are eaten during the second half of the 2-month period when the new batch of bananas arrives. That leaves us with (2xy - xy)/2 remaining bananas.
