The answer is 33.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Now we need to calculate how much Judy earns from each dance class. There are 15 students enrolled in each class, so for one class, she earns $15.00 * 15 = $225.\n\nUsing our hint above, we know that Judy teaches a total of 33 dance classes during the week. We can multiply the amount earned per class by the number of classes to find out how much Judy makes during the week. 33 * $225 = $7,525.\n\nAdditionally, we need to factor in the Saturday classes, where Judy charges $15.00 per student, but only teaches 8 classes. Using our knowledge of the number of students in each class, we can calculate that there are 120 students enrolled in the Saturday dance classes (15 students per class, times 8 classes). Judy's earnings from the Saturday classes are therefore $15.00 * 120 = $1,800.\n\nPutting this all together, we find that Judy's total weekly income from teaching these dance classes is $7,525 (", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
