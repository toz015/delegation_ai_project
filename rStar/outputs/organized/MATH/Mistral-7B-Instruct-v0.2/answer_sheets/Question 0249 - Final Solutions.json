For a number t to have an inverse modulo 23, it must be relatively prime to 23. Since 2 and 3 are the only prime factors of 23, t cannot have any factors other than 1, 2, or 3. Also, since t is odd, it cannot be equal to 0, so it cannot be divisible by 2. That leaves us with three possibilities for t: 1, 3, or 5. Let's check which one works:\n\nIf t = 1: The condition t + 2 = 1\u207b\u00b9 mod 23 doesn't hold.\n\nIf t = 3: The condition t + 2 = 3\u207b\u00b9 mod 23 holds, because 3\u207b\u00b9 mod 23 = 22 and 3 + 2 = 5, and 5 = 5\u207b\u00b9 mod 23.\n\nTherefore, the unique value of $t$ that satisfies both conditions is $\\boxed{3}$.
