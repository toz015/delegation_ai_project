To check if the polynomial $x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1$ is a factor of $x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r$, we can perform long division. However, since the hint suggests using synthetic division, let's try synthetic division instead. When performing synthetic division with remainder, the dividend is written as $x^9$ followed by the coefficients of the polynomial $px^6+qx^3+r$ arranged as digits: $x^9 | p\\, x^6\\,\\, q\\, r$. The divisor $x^3-3x^2+4x-1$ is converted to the same form: $x^3|-3x^2+4x-1$. Now we perform the synthetic division just like long division, subtracting the digit of the divisor corresponding to each digit of the dividend until we reach the constant term.
