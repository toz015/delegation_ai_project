To satisfy condition 2, we need $N=8k+5$ for some non-negative integer $k$. To satisfy condition 3, we need $N=6l+3$ for some non-negative integer $l$. Setting these expressions equal to each other, we get $8k+5=6l+3$. Solving this equation, we have $2k-l=2$. Multiplying through by 2, we get $4k-2l=4$. Dividing through by 2, we get $2k-l=2$. Adding 2 to both sides, we get $2k=(l+2)$. Substituting $l=2m$, we get $2k=2(m+1)$, so $k=m+1$. Thus, $N=8(m+1)+5=8m+13$. The possible values of $N$ are 13, 21, 29, ..., 47.
