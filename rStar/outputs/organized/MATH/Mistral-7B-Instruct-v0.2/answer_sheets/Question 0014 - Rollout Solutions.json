The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. So, the length of the side opposite angle D is $0.7 \\times |DE|$. Since we also know that angle D measures 90 degrees, its cosine is 1, and the length of side DF is $\\frac{|DE|}{\\cos(90^\\circ)} = |DE|$.
