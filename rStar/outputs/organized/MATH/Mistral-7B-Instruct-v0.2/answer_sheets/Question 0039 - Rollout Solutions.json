The answer is 132.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What is the greatest common factor of 132 and 11?", "subanswer": {"text": "By inspection or by using the same method as above, we find that the greatest common factor of 132 and 11 is 1. The answer is 1.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Therefore, the sum of the greatest common factor of 6432 and 132 and 11 is the sum of 132 and 1, which is 133. However, you asked for the greatest common factor instead of the sum. So, I apologize for my mistake. The correct answer is: The greatest common factor of 6432, 132, and 11 is 132.", "2": "Since 6432 and 132 are relatively prime (they don't share any common factors other than 1), the greatest common factor of 6432 and 132 is simply their lowest common denominator, which is 132. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a solution for finding the greatest common factor between 132 and 11 directly. Instead, I recommend using the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization method to find it separately and then multiply the highest powers of primes that appear in both factorizations. The result will be the greatest common factor."}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
