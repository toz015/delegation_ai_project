Let's focus on the first problem: The smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers. To find this, we need to find three consecutive integers whose sum is a perfect cube. The sequence $n, n+1, n+2$ forms such a sequence for $n=12$, since $12^3=1728=12^3+(1+1)^3$. Therefore, the answer to the first problem is 13.

According to Hint 1, the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers is 13. There isn't a requirement in the original problem to determine the next integer after a given number, so Hint 2 does not directly apply to the current situation. Therefore, the answer to the given condition is 13, which is the smallest positive perfect cube that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.
