Thus, the expression $2a+b+a$ simplifies as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n2a+b+a&=2a+a+b\\\\&=3a+b.\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the factored form of the expression $a(2a+b)-2a^{2}+ab$ is $a(3a+b)$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: $a(3a+b)$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many factors does the prime number $a$ have?", "subanswer": {"text": "A prime number has only two distinct positive divisors, 1 and itself.
