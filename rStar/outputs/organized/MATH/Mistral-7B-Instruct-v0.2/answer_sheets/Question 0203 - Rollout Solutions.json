However, we still cannot perform polynomial long division or synthetic division with the given expressions due to the large exponents and negative exponents. But we can notice that each term except the first one has $x$ as a common term: $(5x + 9)^{611}, x^{11}, (x+1)^{-11}, x^2$. We can factor out $x^2$: $(x^2)(5^{611}+1+\\frac{1}{(x+1)^{11}})+3$. Now, we can substitute $u=x+1$ and find the limit of the expression as $u$ approaches infinity: $x^2(\\lim_{u\\to\\infty}(5^{611}+\\frac{1}{u^{11}})+3)$, since the term inside the parentheses goes to infinity faster than any power of $u$. Thus, the remainder is $0$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$. The answer is: 0.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
