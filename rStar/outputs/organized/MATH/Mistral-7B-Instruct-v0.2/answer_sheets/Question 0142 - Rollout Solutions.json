From the condition, we know there are 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 1 Independent, so there are $5+5+1=11$ members. Now, let's consider the number of distinct ways members can sit around the circular table when they sit in separate groups. Since there are 3 groups (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents), and each group is seated together, we can model this as placing 3 distinct objects (groups) around a circular table. The problem of arranging distinct objects around a circular table is equivalent to finding the number of sides on a regular polygon with those objects represented by vertices. A regular polygon with $n$ sides has $n-1$ diagonals connecting any pair of nonadjacent vertices. For our case, since there are 3 groups of equal size, we have $3-1=2$ \"diagonals\" in the sense of group placements. Each diagonal corresponds to one pair of members who switch positions.

Since Democrats, Republicans, and the Independent sit together as separate groups, we can determine the number of ways they can sit around the table by finding the number of ways the Democrats can sit among themselves, and then multiplying it by the number of ways the Republicans can sit among themselves and the number of ways the Independent can sit among themselves. Since there are 5 Democrats, they can sit among themselves in $\\boxed{5!}=120$ ways. The answer is: 120.\n\nHowever, since the table is circular, there are fewer distinct ways for everyone to sit than the product of the number of ways each group can sit. To find the number of distinct ways everyone can sit, we need to divide the total number of ways everyone can arrange themselves by the number of ways the entire group can rotate around the table. Since there are 12 members (5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, and 2 Independents), the number of distinct ways everyone can sit is $\\dfrac{12!}{2!}$. The answer is: $\\dfrac{12!}{2!}$.
