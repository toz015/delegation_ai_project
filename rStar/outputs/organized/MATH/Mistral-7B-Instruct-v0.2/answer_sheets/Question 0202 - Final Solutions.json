Since both Alice and Bob have equal chances of winning once the game continues, the probability of the game ending with Alice as the winner when it doesn't end after the first turn is the same as her probability of winning when it does start with her turn. Thus, the probability that Alice wins the game is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$. The answer is: $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 10}]
