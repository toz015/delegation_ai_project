The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers $a$ and $b$ can be found using the Euclidean algorithm. However, since we're looking for the greatest possible value, it's clear that any common factor of both $n+7$ and $2n+1$ must also be a factor of $n$. Thus, the gcd of $n+7$ and $2n+1$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of $n$ and the difference of $2n+1$ and $n+7$, which is $n$ and $n+1$.
