Since the balls are indistinguishable, we don't care which ball goes into which box. There are several ways to place the 5 balls in the 2 boxes, but since there are twice as many balls as boxes, not all balls can go in each box. So, we put 3 balls in one box and 2 balls in the other box, or vice versa. The number of arrangements is the number of ways to choose which box gets 3 balls, which is $\\binom{5}{3}=10$. But since there are two equally likely arrangements (one with box 1 having 3 balls and the other with box 2 having 3 balls), the total number of distinct arrangements is $\\boxed{10\\times2=20}$. The answer is: 20.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
