However, since there are 1000 terms in total, we know that after calculating the thousandth term, the sequence repeats itself. Therefore, the sum of $x_{531}$, $x_{753}$, and $x_{975}$ equals the sum of any three consecutive terms from the fourth cycle. Let's find the fourth cycle starting from the fifth term: $x_5 = 1027$, $x_6 = 1163$, $x_7 = 1682$, $x_8 = 1698$, $x_9 = 1682$, $x_{10} = 367$. Since the sequence repeats every 10 terms, the fourth cycle starts at term 44 and ends at term 53. Thus, the sum of $x_{531}$, $x_{753}$, and $x_{975}$ equals $x_{531} + x_{542} + x_{553} = 1027 + x_{542} + x_{553}$. To find the latter two terms, note that $x_{542} = x_{43} - x_{42} + x_{41} - x_{40}$ (from the third cycle), and $x_{553} = x_{44} - x_{43} + x_{42} - x_{41}$ (from the fourth cycle).
