Since the square and regular heptagon share a common side $\\overline{AD}$, angle $BAC$ is an interior angle of both the square and the regular heptagon. An interior angle of a regular hexagon measures $\\frac{180^\\circ-(\\text{sum of angles in a full hexagon})}{2}=\\frac{180^\\circ-720^\\circ}{2}=-135^\\circ$.

Thus, angle $BAC$ measures $-135^\\circ+360^\\circ=225^\\circ$.\n\nTo find the degree measure of angle $ADC$, note that the interior angles of a regular heptagon add up to $7\\times 180^\\circ-2\\times 180^\\circ=900^\\circ-360^\\circ=540^\\circ$.
