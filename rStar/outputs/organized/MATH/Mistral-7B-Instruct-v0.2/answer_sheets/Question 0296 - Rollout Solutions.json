To determine which equation has the largest solution for $x$, we need to compare the base of each exponent. The bases in options C, D, and E increase as $r$ increases. However, the base in option B decreases as $r$ increases since $r/10<r$. Therefore, the largest value for the base occurs in options C, D, or E. Among these three, option C has the largest base because $(1+2r)$ is greater than both $(1+\\sqrt{r})$ and $(1+1/r)$ when $r$ is small.
