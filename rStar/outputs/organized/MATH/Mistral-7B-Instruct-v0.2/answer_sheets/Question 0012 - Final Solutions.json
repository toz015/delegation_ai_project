We know that divisors come in pairs: each divisor $a$ has another divisor $\\frac{N}{a}$. So, we look for divisors less than $\\sqrt[]{N}$ to avoid larger divisors. For 16, the square root is 4, so we look for divisors among 1, 2, 4. The product of these divisors is 8. Since we need the sum of the divisors, the sum of the proper divisors of 16 is $\\boxed{8}$.

According to Condition 1, the proper divisors of the number 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
