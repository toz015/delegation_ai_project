The answer is: A logarithmic function is the inverse of an exponential function.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Based on the hint and the condition given, we know that the logarithm $\\log x^2$ is defined when $x$ is either less than $a$ or greater than $b$. The logarithmic function is the inverse of the exponential function, so the exponential function $b^x = y$ has domain $x < -\\log_b(y)$ or $x > \\log_b(y)$ when $b > 1$ or $b < 1$, respectively. Since the given logarithmic function is $\\log x^2$, it follows that $x^2 = b^x \\Rightarrow x = \\pm\\sqrt{b^x}$. Thus, the domain of $\\log x^2$ consists of those numbers whose square root is less than $a$ or greater than $b$: $\\sqrt{x} < a$ or $\\sqrt{x} > b$. Since the square root function is continuous, the intervals $(-\\infty, a)$ and $(b,\\infty)$ must overlap for $x < 0$ since their union would include negative numbers. Thus, $a < -b$ or $b < -a$. Without loss of generality, assume $a <", "value": 0.03125}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
