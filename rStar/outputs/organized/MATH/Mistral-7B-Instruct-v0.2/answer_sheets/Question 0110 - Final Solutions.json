Also, since $a_{13}$, $a_{14}$, $a_{15}$ form an arithmetic sequence, their difference $a_{14} - a_{13}$ is a constant $d$. From the definition of a common ratio, we have $a_{14} = a_{13}r$. Substituting this into the equation for the common difference, we find $d = a_{14} - a_{13} = a_{13}(r-1)$. Since $a_{13}$ is a multiple of $529$, it follows that $d$ is also a multiple of $529$.
