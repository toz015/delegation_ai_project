The answer is $10d + 5n = 75$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "We can solve the equation $10d + 5n = 75$ to determine how many nickels ($n$) Hillary has. First, we want to isolate $n$. We can do this by subtracting 5 times the number of dimes from both sides: $10d + 5n - 5d = 75 - 5d$. Simplifying this equation, we get $5d + 5n = 70$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we find $d+n=14$. From condition 1, we know that $d+n=11$. The only solution that satisfies both equations is when $d=4$ and $n=7$. Therefore, Hillary has $\\boxed{7}$ nickels. The answer is: 7.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
