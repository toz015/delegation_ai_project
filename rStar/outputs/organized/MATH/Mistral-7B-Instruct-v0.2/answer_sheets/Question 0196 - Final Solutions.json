According to the distributive property, we can apply $2(21)$ to each term inside the parentheses: $441+2(21)(19)+361=441+2*21*19+361$. Then, distribute the multiplication sign: $441+382*19+361$. Next, perform multiplication: $441+7258+361$. Finally, add and subtract terms: $7719+361=7756$. Therefore, the simplified left side of the equation is $\\boxed{7756}$.
