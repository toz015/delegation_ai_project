The equations given describe a right triangle with legs of length $\\sqrt{9}=3$ and $\\sqrt{16}=4$, and hypotenuse of length $\\sqrt{25}=5$. According to the determinant identity, if $\\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\\\c&d\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}x_j&y_j&1\\\\x_k&y_k&1\\end{bmatrix}$, then $\\begin{vmatrix}a&b&1\\\\c&d&1\\end{vmatrix}=\\pm(x_ja+y_jk-1)(x_lc+y_lk-1)$, where $i,j,k$ are distinct indices. In our case, $j=1$, $k=2$, and the signs depend on the orientation of the triangle determined by $(x_1,y_1)-(x_2,y_2)-(x_3,y_3)$. Since the sides and area of the given triangle are all positive, the determinant is positive, so the signs can be ignored.
