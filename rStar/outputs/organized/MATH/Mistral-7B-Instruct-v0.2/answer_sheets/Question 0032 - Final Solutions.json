The total number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a round table is given by the formula $8!$ since all seatings are considered equal due to rotation symmetry. However, since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we must first determine how many ways they can sit next to each other and then multiply this value by the number of distinct ways the 5 remaining people can sit. So, there are 3 ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can sit next to each other, and there are 120 ways the remaining 5 people can sit around the table. Therefore, the total number of distinct ways all 8 people can sit around the table, considering the arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as fixed, is $3\\times120=\\boxed{360}$.
