Now we apply the hint and multiply each term inside the square roots by their conjugates: $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})\\times(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})+\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\times\\left(\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$. Simplifying further, we get: $2-(\\sqrt{2}^2-\\sqrt{3}^2)+(\\sqrt{2}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}}$. Expanding and simplifying, we obtain $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}+\\", "value": 0.03125}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
