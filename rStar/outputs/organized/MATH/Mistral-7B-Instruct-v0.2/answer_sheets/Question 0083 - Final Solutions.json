Finally, we solve for $x$ using techniques such as taking the exponent of both sides (if applicable) or solving implicitly. Unfortunately, in this particular case, it's difficult to find an exact solution for $x$, but you could approximate a numerical solution using a calculator or a software tool like Wolfram Alpha. Without such tools, I cannot provide an exact answer. However, the equation to use to find the numerical approximation is $\\ln(\\ln{10^{x}}) = \\ln(2x+1)$.
