By the definition of complex conjugates, $\\overline{r}_k$ is the complex conjugate of $r_k$, so $\\overline{r}_k=r_k^*$. Also, since a complex number and its complex conjugate have the same absolute value but opposite imaginary parts, it follows that $r_k+\\overline{r}_k=|r_k|^2$. From condition 1, we know that the sum of all roots and their conjugates equals zero, i.e., $r_1+\\overline{r}_1+r_2+\\overline{r}_2+\\cdots+r_5+\\overline{r}_5=0$. However, since the sum of the absolute values of all roots squared equals the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the given polynomial, it follows that $|r_1|^2+|r_1|^2+\\cdots+|r_5|^2+|r_5|^2=64$. Since the real part of each root is the average of its conjugate and itself, the real part of each root", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "sums up to $\\dfrac{|r_1|^2+|r_2|^2+\\cdots+|r_5|^2}{2}=\\boxed{32}$.
