However, since rotations of seatings are considered identical, we only need to count the number of distinct seatings for one person in those 4 spots. Since there are 6 empty spots around the table for the other 4 people to sit, there are 6 choices for the position of the first non-Pierre, non-Rosa, non-Thomas person. For each choice of that person's position, there are 5 choices for the position of the second non-Pierre, non-Rosa, non-Thomas person (since they cannot sit next to Pierre, Rosa, or Thomas, who already have positions), and so on.
