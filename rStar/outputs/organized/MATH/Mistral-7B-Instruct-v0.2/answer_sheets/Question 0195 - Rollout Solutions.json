Hint 1 tells us that the sum of the three given roots is 6. Since the leading coefficient of $p(x)$ is 1, using the fact that the sum of the roots of a quartic polynomial with leading coefficient 1 is equal to its constant term, we know that the constant term of $p(x)$ is $-6$, so $p(0) = -6$. Now, we need to find $p(4)$. To do this, we can use synthetic division or substitute $x=4$ into the polynomial equation. However, since the polynomial $p(x)$ is not explicitly stated, we cannot calculate its exact value. Instead, let's leave our answer as a placeholder, which is $-6+p(4)$. The answer is: $-6+p(4)$.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 23}]
