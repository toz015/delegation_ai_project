Given Condition 2, we know we can only use the digits 0 and 2 when forming the integer we need to multiply by 30. One possibility is to write the largest number we can make with just the digits 0 and 2 as many times as possible. The largest number we can make with just 0s is 0, and the largest number we can make with just 2s is 99 (since 100 would require a digit other than 0 or 2). Multiplying 30 by 99 results in a 10-digit number whose last digit is a 0. However, since we're only asked for the smallest possible outcome, it makes more sense to consider the smallest 10-digit number made up of just 0s and 2s. The smallest such number is 0000000020 (note that adding another zero at the beginning doesn't change the value of the number). Multiplying 30 by this number gives $\\boxed{0,000,000,020}$.
