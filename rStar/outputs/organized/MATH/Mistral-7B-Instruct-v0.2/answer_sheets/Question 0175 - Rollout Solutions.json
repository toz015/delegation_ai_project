The absolute difference between two integers $a$ and $b$ is $|a-b|$. In order to calculate the absolute difference, you need to find the difference between the two integers and take the absolute value. For example, the absolute difference between $5$ and $2$ is $|5-2|=|3|=3$, while the absolute difference between $-3$ and $4$ is $|-3-(-4)|=|1|=1$.
