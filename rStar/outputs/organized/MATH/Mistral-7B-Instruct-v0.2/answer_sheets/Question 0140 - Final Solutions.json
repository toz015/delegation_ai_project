To find the greatest common divisor, you need to analyze the prime factorization of both expressions and identify the common prime factors and their minimum exponent. Unfortunately, without knowing the value of $n$, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer. You would need to calculate the prime factorizations of $n+7$ and $2n+1$ separately for each value of $n$.\n\nHere's the general process you would follow:\n\n1. Find the prime factorization of $n+7 = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$\n2. Find the prime factorization of $2n+1 = q_1^{b_1}q_2^{b_2}\\cdots q_l^{b_l}$\n3.
