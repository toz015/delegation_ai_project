Condition 2 tells us that after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the number of blue marbles is $\\frac{7}{3}$ times the number of yellow marbles. So, the number of blue marbles is $\\frac{7}{3}x - 3$. Setting these expressions equal to each other, we get $\\frac{4}{7}x = \\frac{7}{3}x - 3$. Solving this equation for x, we find $x=\\boxed{9}$. The number of blue marbles initially was $(\\frac{4}{7}\\times 9)=\\boxed{12}$. The answer is: 12.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
