Condition 1:  Two consecutive positive even integers multiply to give the result of 288. Question: Which of the two integers is larger?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What are the possible pairs of consecutive even integers whose product equals 288?", "subanswer": {"text": "The factors must be the form $2k$ and $2(k+1)$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. To find the possible values of $k$, we need to find the smallest value that satisfies the inequality $2k \\times 2(k+1) > 288$: $2 \\times 1 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 12 < 288$; $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 24 < 288$; $2 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 36 < 288$; $2 \\times 4 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 48 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 6$. The only pair satisfying the condition is 4 and 6. The answer is $4$ and $6$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Which of the two integers is larger?", "subanswer": {"text": "The larger integer is 6.
