From condition 2, we know that angle A is inscribed within a circle, and side AB is a diameter. Therefore, angle A is a right angle because half of a circle's central angle measures up as a right angle. Since angle A is a right angle (180\u00b0), angle A lies opposite the center of the circle in the alternate segments created by the diameter. Thus, each of the other two angles in triangle \u0394ABC is also a right angle. In a semicircle, the central angle measures twice the measure of one of the inscribed angles. Since angle A measures 14\u00b0, the central angle measures 2 * 14 = 28\u00b0. The measure of each of the remaining angles in the triangle is 180\u00b0 - 28\u00b0 = 152\u00b0, or 150\u00b0 (since degrees are measured in increments of 1\u00b0).
