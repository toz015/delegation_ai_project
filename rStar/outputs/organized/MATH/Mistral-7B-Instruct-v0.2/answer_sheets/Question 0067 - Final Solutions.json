Condition 1:  The side lengths of a square are decreased by $40\\%$ for its two opposite sides, and increased by $50\\%$ for its other two sides to form a rectangle. Question: By what percentage does the area of the square decrease?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What is the ratio of the length of a side of the square to the length of a side of the rectangle?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let the side length of the square be $s$. Then, the two opposite sides of the rectangle have length $s-0.4s=0.6s$, and the other two sides have length $s+0.5s=1.5s$. To find the ratio of the length of a side of the square to the length of a side of the rectangle, we divide the length of one side of the square by the length of one side of the rectangle: $\\frac{s}{0.6s}:\\frac{s}{1.5s}$. Simplifying this ratio, we get $\\frac{1}{0.6}:\\frac{1}{1.5}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}:\\frac{1}{3}}$. The answer is: 2/3 : 1/3.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How is the area of the square affected if one side is shortened by a certain percentage while the other three sides are extended?", "subanswer": {"text": "If the length of one side of the square is shortened by $40\\%$ while the other sides are extended by $50\\%$, the total area change would depend on whether the side that's being shortened is part of the larger or smaller dimension of the rectangle. Since the ratio of the side lengths is now 2:1, the square's side length makes up the smaller dimension of the rectangle. Therefore, the area of the square is reduced because one of its sides, which is contributing less to the overall area compared to the other sides, is made smaller. Consequently, the area of the square decreases by approximately $\\boxed{20\\%}$.
