The power rule for exponents states that $b^{m}^n=b^{mn}$. To apply this rule to the expression $b^{c^d}$, we need to first find $c^d$: $c^d=(c)^{d}$. Then, raise $b$ to the power of $c^d$: $b^{c^d}=b^{(c)^{d}}=(b^{c})^{d}$. This is known as De Morgan's law or the \"law of exponents\" for raising an exponent to another exponent. The answer is: $b^{c^d}={(b^{c})}^{d}$. The answer is: the exponentiation rule for calculating $b^{c^d}$ is ${(b^{c})}^{d}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What is $2^{235423523}$?", "subanswer": {"text": "A calculator would provide the value of $2^{235423523}$, but the value itself isn't necessary since we only need to know that it is a very large number.
