To find the greatest common divisor ($gcd$) of three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, you can use the Euclidean algorithm. This method consists of repeatedly applying the following steps until the $gcd$ is obtained: find the greatest common divisor of $b$ and the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$ ($r=a\\ mod\\ b$). Then set $a=b$ and $b=r$, and repeat. The last nonzero value of $b$ is the $gcd$ of the original three integers.\n\nIn your case, $a = 3339$, $b = 2961$, and $c = 1491$. Following the steps of the Euclidean algorithm:\n\nStep 1: Find the remainder of dividing $a$ by $b$: $r = a \\% b$. You can also calculate it as follows: $r = a - \\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\rfloor*b$.

Starting with the first condition, we have $a = 3339$, $b = 2961$, and $c = 1491$. Applying the first hint, we use the Euclidean algorithm to find their greatest common divisor. We calculate the remainder of dividing $a$ by $b$: $r = a \\% b$. Alternatively, we could calculate the remainder as follows: $r = a - \\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\rfloor*b$. Following these calculations, we get $r = 3339 - \\lfloor\\frac{3339}{2961}\\rfloor*2961 = 1332$. Therefore, the greatest common divisor of $3339$, $2961$, and $1491$ is $\\boxed{1332}$.
