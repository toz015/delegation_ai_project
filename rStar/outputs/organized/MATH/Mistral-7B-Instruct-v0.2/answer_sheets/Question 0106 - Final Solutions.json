Since the degree of the numerator and denominator are equal, and the degree is greater than zero, the graph of the function exhibits a horizontal asymptote as $x \\to \\infty$ or $x \\to -\\infty$. To find the equation of the horizontal asymptote, we look at the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator. If the leading coefficients were equal, the horizontal asymptote would be a constant line; however, since the leading coefficients of the numerator ($4$) and denominator ($3x^3$) are not equal, there is no constant horizontal asymptote. Instead, the quotient of the leading coefficients ($4/3$) gives the slope of the diagonal asymptotes. Thus, the equations of the horizontal asymptotes are $y=\\dfrac{4}{3}x$ and $y=-\\dfrac{4}{3}x$.
