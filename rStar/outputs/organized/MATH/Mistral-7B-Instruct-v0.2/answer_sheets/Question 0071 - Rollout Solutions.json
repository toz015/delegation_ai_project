To convert a binary number to octal, we group consecutive binary digits into sets of 3 starting from the rightmost digit (if necessary, adding leading zeros). Then we replace each set of three binary digits by its corresponding octal digit using the binary-to-octal conversion table ($000$, $001$, $010$, $011$, $100$, $101$, $110$, $111$). For our binary number $10101001110_{2}$, we get the following groups: $1~010~100~110$. Using the binary-to-octal conversion table, we have $1~\\rightarrow~1$, $010\\rightarrow~2$, $100\\rightarrow~4$, and $110\\rightarrow~6$. Putting it together, we get $\\boxed{1246}$.
