Using the sum from the hint, we have $55 \\% 9$. To find the remainder, we use long division or the formula for the last digit of a power of 10 plus a digit: $10^{n}+a \\equiv a (\\text{mod }10)$. Here, $n=2$ since there are 2 digits before the last one ($5$). So, the last digit of $55^{th}$ term is 5. Therefore, the remainder is $55\\%9=5$.
