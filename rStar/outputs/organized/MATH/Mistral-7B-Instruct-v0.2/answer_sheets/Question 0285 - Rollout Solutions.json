Evaluating the discriminant at $c=0$ yields a negative value, implying no real roots. As the discriminant is a continuous function of $c$, there exists a real value of $c$ such that the discriminant is zero, resulting in exactly one real root, making it a double root. A double root cannot be a positive integer, so we can discard this case. Therefore, the polynomial has three distinct positive integer roots when the discriminant is positive. Since $a = 1$ already satisfies the condition that the discriminant be positive, it follows that there are infinitely many possible values of $c$. To illustrate, let us find the first few solutions: when $c = 15$, the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3-2x^2+3x-15$ has roots $x = 1, 2, 3$; when $c = 27$, the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3-2x^2+1x-27$ has roots $x = 1, 3, 4$; when $c = 43$, the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3-2x^2+5x-43$ has roots $x = 1, 2, 7$.

However, since Jon asked for a sum, we can try to find a pattern in the values of $c$ for the first few cases and then sum them up. The values of $c$ for the first few cases mentioned in step 3 are 15, 27, 43, ... It appears that each value of $c$ is obtained by adding the cube of a positive integer to 1681.
