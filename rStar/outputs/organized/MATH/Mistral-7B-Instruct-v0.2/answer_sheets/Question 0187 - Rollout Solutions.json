Question: How many nickels does she have?", "ost_step": {"1": "Let's assume Hillary has $x$ nickels and $y$ dimes."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step using the hint. From condition 2, we know that Hillary has either all nickels or all dimes, but since her collection contains exactly eleven coins, it cannot consist only of one type of coin. Thus, her collection must contain both nickels and dimes. Using condition 3, we set up the equation $5x+10y=75$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=(75-10y)/5$. However, $x$ must be a non-negative integer because Hillary cannot have negative or fractional number of coins. Therefore, we need to check the integer solutions of $10y\\leq 75$. When $y=3$, we have $x=10$ and when $y=4$, we have $x=7$. Since having 10 nickels and 1 dime leaves Hillary with 1 cent, which is not possible, she must have 7 nickels and 6 dimes instead. Therefore, the number of nickels that Hillary has is $\\boxed{7}$.

We can do this by making one variable represent the difference between the two terms. For example, let's make $d$ the difference: $10d - 5n = 20$. Divide both sides by 5: $2d-n=4$. Add $n$ to both sides: $2d=n+4$. Divide both sides by 2: $d=\\frac{n+4}{2}$. Now we can use substitution to find the value of $n$: $10(\\frac{n+4}{2})+5n=75$. Multiply both sides by 2: $5d+10n=150$.
