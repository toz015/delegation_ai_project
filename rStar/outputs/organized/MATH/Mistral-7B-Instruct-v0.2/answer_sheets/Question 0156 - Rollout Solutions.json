Since they run in the same direction and start at the same point, the difference in their positions after t time is just the product of their respective speeds and time: 3vT - vT = 2vT. Now, we set up a proportion using the ratio of time taken to cover the distance and the distance itself. For both runners, the track length L equals the product of their respective speeds and times taken: L = vT for runner A and L = (3v)(T/3) for runner B. Setting these equal, we get L = vT = 3vT/3, which implies that v = L/T. Substituting this back into our earlier equation for the position difference, we get AP = 3vT = 3(L/T)T =", "value": 0.03125}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Two runners, $A$ and $B,$ start at a point $O$ on a linear track, and start running in the same direction.
