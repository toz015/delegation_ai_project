We'll use the fact that the remainder when a polynomial is divided by a binomial of the form $x^2-a$ is the coefficient of the term $x^2$ in the polynomial's expansion around $x=0$. In this case, the polynomial is $f(x)$, and the binomial is $x^2-1$. To find the expansion of $f(x)$ around $x=0$, we need to square each term in $f(x)$ and add them up: $x^{10}\\cdot x^{10}=x^{20}$, $5x^9\\cdot x^2=5x^{11}$, etc. Doing this for all terms, we get: $x^{12}+2x^{11}-x^8-x^6-2x^4+2x^2$. Now, taking the coefficient of $x^2$, we see that it is 2. Therefore, the remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $x^2-1$ is $\\boxed{2}$.
