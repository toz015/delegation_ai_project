According to condition 1, 15 customers buy a television costing $\\$$1500. Based on condition 2, the popularity (number of sales) of a television is inversely proportional to its cost. This means that the relationship between the cost and the number of customers is given by $\\text{Number of Customers}\\propto\\frac{1}{\\text{Cost}}$. To find the number of customers who would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500, we set up a proportion: $\\frac{15}{1500}=\\frac{N}{2500}$, where $N$ is the number of customers who would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500.
