The sum of the digits before the decimal point is always 4+3+2+1=10. The digit sequence after the decimal point repeats infinitely, so we don't need to include them when calculating the sum. Therefore, the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of $\\frac{4321}{5^7\\cdot2^8}$ is $\\boxed{10}$.
