We know that an integer is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even or 0. It is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits modulo 3 is zero. To find the integers that are divisible by 2 but not by 3, we need to find the integers whose last digit is even or 0 and whose digit sum is not divisible by 3. The integers satisfying this condition are those ending in 0, 2, or 8, since their digit sums are 0, 2, or 8 when considering only the digits 0, 1, and 2. However, some of these integers may also be divisible by 3. For example, the integer 2 ends in 2 and has a digit sum of 2, so it satisfies both conditions. But 3, 6, and 9 end in 3, 6, or 9 respectively, and their digit sums are also multiples of 3. Therefore, the actual number of integers that are only divisible by 2 is one less than the number of integers ending in 0, 2", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the probability of selecting an integer divisible by 2 but not by 3 from the given set?", "subanswer": {"text": "There are 98 such integers (since there are 49 integers ending in odd digits other than 5), and the total number of integers is 100.
