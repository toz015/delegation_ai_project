If the second derivative is positive, then the critical point is a local minimum. If it's negative, then it's a local maximum. In our case, we haven't been given the second derivative, but knowing that the critical point $x_1$ has a larger absolute value than $x_2$ suggests that $x_1$ may be the maximum (though this isn't definitive).
