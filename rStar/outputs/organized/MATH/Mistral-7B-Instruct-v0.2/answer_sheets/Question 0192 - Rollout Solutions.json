But since the question asks for the median, the previous method is simpler and more direct.", "subanswer": {"text": "(Alternative answer) To find the length of the median $\\overline{QM}$, we first calculate the semiperimeter s = (p + q + r)/2 = (34 + 34 + 32)/2 = 52. Then, we use Heron's formula to find the area A = sqrt[s*(s-p)*(s-q)*(s-r)] = sqrt[52*(52-34)*(52-34)*(52-32)] = 236. We now find the height h through the formula A = (base * height) / 2, where the base b = 34. Thus, h = 2*A/b = 2*(236)/34 = 13. With the base length b = 34 and the median height h = 13, we have the length of median $\\overline{QM}$ as b/2 + h/2 = 34/2 + 13/2 = 19.5.
