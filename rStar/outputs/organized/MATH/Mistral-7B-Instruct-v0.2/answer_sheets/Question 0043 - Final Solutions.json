The second term, $\\sqrt{y^2 + 900}$, also attains its minimum value when $y=0$, but its minimum value is $\\sqrt{900}=30$. The third term, $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100}$, cannot be determined directly without more information. However, since the other terms have already been minimized, this term does not affect the overall minimum value. Therefore, the minimum value of the entire expression is $20 + 30 = \\boxed{50}$.
