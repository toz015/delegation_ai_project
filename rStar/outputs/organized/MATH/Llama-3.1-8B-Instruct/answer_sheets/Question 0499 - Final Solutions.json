This implies the previous steps were incorrect, so let\u2019s go back to step 5.1 and see if we can correctly solve for angle BCA. Step 5.1 stated that angles BAC and BCA are supplementary. Let\u2019s call angle BCA x. So 54 + x = 180, which simplifies to x = 180 \u2013 54. x is equal to 126. We already knew that, but what about our other angle, ABH or CBF? We also know that triangle ABC is not equilateral because angle BAC does not equal angle ACB. Therefore, we can use the Law of Sines: AB/Sin(CAB)=BC/sin(BAC). AB/sin(36) = BC/sin(68), where CAB and BAC are the known angles, or 68 and 36, and we plug them into the formula. Now we have sin(BAC)/sin(CAB) = BC/AB, which equals BC/AB = 0.766/0.923 or approximately 0.83. Now we need to figure out how to get this ratio to work. To simplify things, let\u2019s say AB equals x. Then BC would equal approximately 0.83x. This means the sine of angle CAB would be approximately 0.866, which is equivalent to angle AHC being approximately 60\u00b0. Therefore, using angle addition to get the measure of angle AHB, we get 90 + 60 = 150\u00b0. The answer is 150\u00b0.
