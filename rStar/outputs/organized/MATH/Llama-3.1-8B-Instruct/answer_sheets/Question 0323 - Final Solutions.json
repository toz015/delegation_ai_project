Without loss of generality, assume point $B$ is located somewhere on the circle. For segment $AB$ to intersect with either segment $CD$, point $C$ must lie within the semicircle defined by arc $B$ above the chord $AB$. Therefore, the probability that points $B$ and $C$ satisfy this condition is 1/2. Similarly, since segment $CD$ is also formed randomly, the probability that point $D$ lies within the semicircle defined by arc $B$ below the chord $AB$ is again 1/2. However, there is still one more possibility left: segment $AB$ passes through point $C$ or $D$. When that happens, the whole circle becomes the region where $D$ could lie and not intersect $AB$. Thus, our new sample space changes to the entire circle. Since the area of the entire circle is the same as the combined area of the arcs created when $AB$ doesn't go through $C$ or $D$, the probability remains the same.

For the purposes of determining the probability of the segments intersecting, we'll assume that the four points A, B, C, and D are placed equally on the circumference of the circle, each being separated by 90 degrees. Now, let's consider how many ways there are to arrange the points such that the segments AB and CD intersect. Given that A and C are always going to be on opposite sides of the diameter of the circle because of our assumption of even spacing, segment AC will also run along the same line as the diameter. The same goes for points B and D. Because of this, we know that the other side of the diameter must contain either B or D. There are $2^4=16$ possible arrangements of the points A, B, C, and D around the circumference of the circle. By counting the number of arrangements that satisfy our desired outcome, we see that $8$ out of the 16 possible arrangements cause the lines AB and CD to intersect.
