Given that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, it follows that $ab=210\\cdot 210^3=44100\\cdot 210$ by the formula $ab=(\\gcd(a,b))(\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b])$. Because $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $210$, the prime factorization of each of $a$ and $b$ must include exactly one factor of $2$, one factor of $3$, and one factor of $7$. However, since $a$ and $b$ are both less than $210^3$ but larger than $210$, each of them cannot contain any additional factors other than those already present within the prime factorization of $210$.
