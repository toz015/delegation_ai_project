Let the length of rectangle ABCD be L and the width of rectangle ABCD be W. If the centers of the diagonals coincide with the center of the rectangle, the area of the smaller rectangle would be $\\frac{L}{2}\\times\\frac{W}{2}=\\frac{LW}{4}$. Then the area of the larger rectangle would be LW. So the desired probability is $\\frac{Area_{smaller rectangle}}{Area_{larger rectangle}} = \\frac{\\frac{LW}{4}}{LW}=\\frac{1}{4}$.
