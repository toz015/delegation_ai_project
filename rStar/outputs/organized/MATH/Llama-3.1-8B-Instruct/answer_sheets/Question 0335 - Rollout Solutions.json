To prove that this pattern holds true, let's assume it does and show that our assumption leads to the conclusion that the pattern really does hold true. If the remainders do repeat every four terms, then we can write $a_n\\equiv b_{n\\bmod4}$ where $b_k$ denotes the remainder of the $k^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence modulo 4. We know that $a_1,a_2,a_3,$ and $a_4$ give us the initial four terms of the Fibonacci sequence, so we can write $a_1=a_2=a_3=1$ and $a_4=3.$", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Thus, we can write $b_1=b_2=b_3=1$ and $b_4=3.$ Furthermore, the recursive relation defining the Fibonacci sequence tells us that $a_{n+1}=a_n+a_{n-1},$ or equivalently, that $a_{n+1}-a_n-a_{n-1}=0.$ Taking both sides modulo 4, we see that $$a_{n+1}-a_n-a_{n-1}\\equiv0\\pmod4.$$Since the first three terms are all congruent modulo 4, we can simplify the expression above to get \\begin{align*}", "2": "a_{n+1}-a_n-(a_n-a_{n-1})&amp;\\equiv0\\pmod4\\\\", "3": "a_{n+1}-2a_n+a_{n-1}&amp;\\equiv0\\pmod4,"}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, $\\ldots$ where each term is the sum of the previous two terms.

To find the remainder when the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by 4, we can look for a pattern in the remainders when each term is divided by 4. We notice that the sequence starts repeating every 12 terms with the remainders being $1,1,2,3,0,5,1,6,7,9,3,2$. Thus, we just need to divide 100 by 12 to see what term we get in this cycle. Dividing 100 by 12 yields a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 4, meaning that the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term corresponds to the fourth value in our repeating list, i.e., it is equal to 3 modulo 4. Hence, $\\boxed{3}$ is the answer to our question. The answer is: 3.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
