To maximize $a$, we need to minimize $c$ and maximize $b$. By plugging in some test points, such as 0 and 1, into $ax^2 + bx + c$, we see that $|c|$ must be less than or equal to $|a|/2$, since at both $x=0$ and $x=1$, the minimum absolute value of the quadratic will occur. If we set $|c|=0$, then it follows that $|a|\\geq 2$, since we also know that the maximum of the quadratic occurs when $x=-\\frac{b}{2a}$. At $x=0.5$, the quadratic evaluates to $ac+\\frac{b^2}{4a}=1$, and we wish to maximize $a$, so let us plug in our known bounds for $a$ and $c$: $$a(\\text{min})^2+(\\text{max}(b))^2/(4a(\\text{max}))=1$$ Solving this, we get $$(\\text{min})^2 a=(\\text{max}(b))^2/(4a(\\text{max})) \\implies (\\text", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the greatest possible value of the sum of the absolute values of $a$, $b$, and $c$?", "subanswer": {"text": "This requires another inequality argument, which is a bit tricky, but basically if we let $M$ be the max of the absolute values of $a,b,c$, and define $q=a/M+b/M+c/M$, then we have $|q| \\leq (1+1/2+1)=2$. However, solving this is too complicated for now. Another approach is trying to directly bound the sum $|a|+|b|+|c|$, using the previous information. This problem seems harder than it looks, so let\u2019s try to simplify it. One idea is to pick a specific set of $a,b,c$, which make everything easy, and try to maximize the sum of their absolute values. So if we choose $c=0$ and $b=0$, then this becomes maximizing $|a|$, but since $|c|$ must be less than half $|a|$, we cannot simply maximize $|a|$. But maybe we can try to pick $|a|=2$ (since $|a|\\geq 2$), so that $|c|<1$, which makes things simple. This lets us pick $c=0$, which simplifies things to just finding the right $a$ and $b$ so that the quadratic stays within the bounds $-1$ to $1$. However, if we look back at the condition we derived above ($a^2=b^2/4a$), we see that $a^2 > b^2/4a$, or $a^2 \\geq b^2/4a$. Thus, in order to maximize the sum $|a|+|b|+|c|$, we want to pick $|a|=2$, $|b|=\\pm 2$, and $|c|=0$, giving a sum of $\\boxed{4}$ for the absolute values.
