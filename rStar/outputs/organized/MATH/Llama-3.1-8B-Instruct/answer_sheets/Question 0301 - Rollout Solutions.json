Since the average price is just the total cost divided by the number of items, we need to know the total cost of the 70's stamps and how many 70's stamps Juan purchased. If the total cost is C and n is the number of stamps, then the average price of a single stamp is C/n. Since we know n=43, we need to find C. The cost of the Brazilian stamps is (6)(12)=72 cents, the cost of the French stamps is (6)(12)=72 cents, the cost of the Peruvian stamps is (4)(6)=24 cents, and the cost of the Spanish stamps is (5)(13)=65 cents. Therefore, the total cost of the 70's stamps is $C=(6)(12)+(6)(12)+(4)(6)+(5)(13)=72+72+24+65=233$ cents. The average price of a single 70's stamp is $\\frac{233}{43}=5.419008...$ cents.
