To begin solving this problem, first consider condition 2. If point P is equidistant from points A and O, then it must lie on the perpendicular bisector of segment AO.

Recall that the midpoint of a segment defined by points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ is the point $(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, \\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}).$ For segment AO, the midpoint is therefore $(\\frac{10}{2}, \\frac{-10}{2})(5,-5).$ Now, let us consider condition 1.

From Condition 2, since point P is equidistant from points A(10,-10) and O(0,0), it is on the perpendicular bisector of segment AO. To find the midpoint of segment AO, we take the average of the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately. Midpoint = ((10+0)/2 , (-10+0)/2) = (5,-5). Now we need to find the slope of segment AO. Slope = change in y / change in x = (-10-0)/(10-0)=-1. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of segment AO, so the slope of the perpendicular bisector is 1. Now we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to get the equation of the perpendicular bisector. Since point (5,-5) is on the line and the slope of the line is 1, we have y - (-5)=1(x - 5). Simplify to get y+5=x-5, which reduces further to y=x-10.
