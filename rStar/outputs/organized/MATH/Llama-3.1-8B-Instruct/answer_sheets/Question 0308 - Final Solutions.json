In particular, the area of each triangular face must be $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot \\text{Area of the Base}.$ Using the fact that the area of the base is equal to the area of the square with side-length $s$ (i.e., area $s^2$), this means that the area of each triangular face must be $$A_{\\triangle}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot s^2.$$ Because the perimeter of the base of this pyramid is equal to four times the length of its side ($4s$), and this perimeter equals the perimeter of the circumscribed rectangle, the height of this pyramid must equal the distance from the center of the square to any corner of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the desired height is $$h=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{2}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}.$$ Plugging this into the formula for the area of a triangle gives $$A_\\triangle=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot s\\cdot \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{s^2}{2\\sqrt{2}},$$ so the desired ratio of the areas of the triangular faces to the area of the base is indeed $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.$ Therefore, each triangular face of the regular square pyramid has area $A_{\\triangle}=\\frac{s^2}{2\\sqrt{2}}$, and the total surface area of this pyramid is \\begin{align*}", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2.
