Now, because $3 + 1 = 4$ and $F_3 = 1$ while 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 and $F_2 = 1$ , we know that the possible remainders of $F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4$ and $F_5$ when divided by 4 are 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 respectively.

We'll start with finding the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence and then determine its remainder after division by 4. Then we consider whether there is a pattern in the remainders of the Fibonacci sequence that repeats periodically. We know that the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. As we calculate more terms, we notice a pattern for remainders after dividing by 4. If we take the first four terms of the sequence - 1, 1, 2, 3 - and divide them by 4, we get remainders of 1, 1, 2, 3 respectively. Continuing to generate terms in the sequence, we find that the next four terms are 5, 8, 13, and 21. When we divide these by 4, we again obtain remainders of 1, 0, 1, and 1. Noticing the pattern in the remainders of the Fibonacci sequence, we realize that the sequence of remainders begins repeating itself every 12 terms.
