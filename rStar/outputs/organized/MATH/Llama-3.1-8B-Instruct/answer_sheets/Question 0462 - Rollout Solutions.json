Let's first calculate how much each girl made in total, assuming each one sold her own variety. To make it easier to add up the numbers, let's convert them into cents. The amounts of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie in cents are $400,600,300,$ and $200$, respectively. Now we need to check whether any of these totals is a multiple of 10 to see if each girl sold exactly 50 boxes of each type. Checking each total shows that only $500$ is not a multiple of $10$. Thus, either none or two girls sold exactly $50$ boxes of each type. If none did, then none sold more than $50$ boxes of any type. For example, Sherry could not have sold more than $44$ boxes of her type because then she would have had more than $2200$ cents, but we know she didn't earn anywhere near that much. Similarly, June couldn't have sold more than $30$ boxes of her type, and so on. However, Linda could still have sold up to $40$ boxes of her type, earning no more than $2400$ cents.
