To solve the problem, let's first consider condition 1 and the hint provided. Since ABCD is a square with an area of 16 square inches, we know that each side of the square has a length of 4 inches. According to condition 2, we have 7 pieces representing different shapes including isosceles triangles and a square labeled as 'e'. However, in order to calculate the area of the shaded piece, we need to visualize how the puzzle could form a shape with just the one shaded piece left over and the rest being filled by other pieces. Considering this, we see that triangle ADE can be formed using three congruent right triangles and the square piece e, forming a square of side length 2 inches. Using the information provided in the hint, we can now conclude that the shaded region represents the difference between the areas of squares of side lengths 4 inches and 2 inches. Thus, we get the area of the shaded piece as follows: Area of the larger square - Area of the smaller square = (4^2) - (2^2) = (16) - (4) = 12.
