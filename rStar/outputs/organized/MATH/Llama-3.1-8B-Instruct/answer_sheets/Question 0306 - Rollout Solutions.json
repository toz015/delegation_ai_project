Condition 2: Whenever $c$ is a root of the given equation, then $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the same equation. Question: How many different quadratic equations satisfy both of the above conditions?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Can the sum of the roots be greater than the square of any possible root?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. If $r$ is a root of the equation $x^2 + ax + b = 0,$ then $r^2 + ar + b=0.$ By the second condition, $c^2 - 2$ is also a root, so it satisfies the quadratic equation. Thus, $(c^2 - 2)^2 + a(c^2 - 2) + b = 0.$ Expanding, we get $c^4 - 4c^2 + 4 + ac^2 - 2a + b = 0.$ Rearranging terms, we have $c^4 - (a - 1)c^2 + (-2a + b + 4)=0.$ Hence, either $a\\geq1$ or else the above polynomial cannot equal zero for some $c$. Let $D=-2a+b+4$. Now suppose that both roots are less than or equal to 1. Then, by Vieta's formulas, $r+s \\leq a$ and $rs=b.$ Combining these two equations yields $a=r+s \\leq r^2+s^2 = rs + (r+s) + 1 \\leq", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many different quadratic equations satisfy both of the above conditions?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since there are only 2 possibilities ($a=3,b=8$ or $a=3,b=0$), there are $\\boxed{2}$ such quadratics.
