Now, let's go back to the original problem. We know that 2004 is not divisible by 4 or 3. We need to determine the remainder when it is divided by 12. To do this, we first note that 2004 is even, so 2004 \u00f7 2 = 1002. Also, 1002 ends in a zero, so 1002 \u00f7 10 = 100.2. Finally, since 100 is divisible by 4, 2004 \u00f7 4 = 501.
