Given condition 2, since the total number, $21420N$, must be divisible by 6, then it must also be divisible by 3. We first determine whether 21420N is divisible by 2. Because 21420N ends in 0, the last digit is even and therefore 21420N is always divisible by 2. Now, let's check divisibility by 3. To do so, we use the rule that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Here, that would mean $(2+1+4+2+0+N) = N+9$ must be divisible by 3.

For condition 2, since the total number $21420N$ must be divisible by 6, it must also be divisible by 3. For condition 1, $21420N$ is already divisible by 2 because it ends with 0. Therefore, we just need to check for divisibility by 3. Given that any multiple of 3 can have units digits 0, 3, 6, or 9, let's consider each possibility: If N=0, then 21420N=214200, which is indeed a multiple of 3. Thus, N=0 is one solution. If N=3, then 21420N=214203, which is not a multiple of 3. So, N=3 does not work. Similarly, 214206 and 214209 are multiples of 3 when N=6 and N=9 respectively. However, we've already seen N=0 satisfy the divisibility requirement, so our answer won't depend on whether or not N=3, 6, or 9.
