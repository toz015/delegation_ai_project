This means that our goal of maximizing $y$ while keeping $l=400$ constant cannot occur unless $x$ is somehow constrained. In other words, the previous assumption that $y$ could take any value has turned out not to be valid. To make progress, suppose that the width of the field $y=x$; then the height would just be a segment of the circle instead of a separate line (we already know $y>0$). This suggests that when $y$ increases (i.e., $x$ decreases), the height of the rectangle increases until it reaches its maximal possible value. We now need to determine how small $y$ can be made while still satisfying the constraint $(4+2\\pi)x+2y=400$, which we previously derived. We solve for $y$ to get $y=200-\\pi x$. Our constraints tell us that $y > 0$ and $l=400$. So $200-\\pi x>0$, hence $x<200/\\pi$. Also, substituting $y=x$ into the equation, we have $(4+2\\pi)x+2x=400$ which becomes $6x+2\\pi x=400$.
