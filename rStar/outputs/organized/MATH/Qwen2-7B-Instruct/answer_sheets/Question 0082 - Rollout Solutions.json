Point $B$ lies somewhere within or on the square which has opposite corners at points $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$. What is the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing points $A$ and $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The slope of the line containing points A and B is maximum when line AB passes through the top right corner of the first square $(2,2)$ and the bottom left corner of the second square $(4,2)$. The slope \\(m\\) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}. \\]\n\nFor our points, let one be \\((x_1, y_1) = (2, 2)\\) and the other be \\((x_2, y_2) = (4, 2)\\). Plugging those into the formula yields\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{2 - 2}{4 - 2} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0. \\]\n\nThis means the line AB would be horizontal since both points share the same y-coordinate.\n\nHowever, since you asked for the _greatest_ possible slope, it actually would occur under different conditions. If you consider the extreme case where point A is at the top right corner of the first square \\((2,2)\\) and point B is just slightly inside the second square but making the vertical difference maximal while keeping the", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
