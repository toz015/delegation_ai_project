Kathy decides to withdraw half of her \\$300 in pounds and half in euros. She ends up with 150 USD in pounds (\\(300 / 2 = 150\\)) and 150 USD in euros, using the conversion rate directly (since 1 euro = 1 USD). After converting these amounts into pounds and euros with respect to the given rates:\n\n- For pounds: \\(150 \\, \\text{USD} \\div 1.64 \\approx 91.46 \\, \\text{pounds}\\)\n- For euros: She already knows she has 150 euros because \\(300 / 2 = 150\\) and 1 dollar = 1 euro in this context.\n\nTo determine how many more euros than pounds Kathy will have:\n\n\\[150 \\, \\text{euros} - 91.46 \\, \\text{pounds} = 58.54\\]\n\nAfter rounding to the nearest whole number, Kathy has \\(\\boxed{59}\\) more euros than pounds.\n\nThe answer is: \\(\\boxed{59}\\).", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Kathy needs money for her trip to Europe.
