As stated, this happens when the fraction is simplified to have a denominator consisting solely of powers of 2 and/or 5. Given the constraint about odd integers, our focus shifts to identifying odd integers whose reciprocals might still meet these criteria due to them potentially being of the form \\(3^n\\). \n\nRecall that \\(3^k\\) is not generally associated with terminating decimals unless we multiply it by some power of 2 to get an entire power of \\(2 \\cdot 3^k\\), but since we\u2019re dealing with odd numbers here, the direct relevance of \\(3\\) is limited to our context. However, we\u2019re considering the reciprocal scenario directly, which fundamentally relies on the divisibility properties of the original numerator (in this case, the odd integer itself) rather than focusing on powers of specific primes as a precondition for termination.\n\nGiven the hint's clarification that the only primes involved (besides 2 and 5) that could affect termination when considering odd numbers' reciprocals are powers of 3 (\\(3^n\\)), this implies our primary concern shifts towards understanding how an odd integer\u2019s composition influences whether its reciprocal terminates.
