To find the remainder of their sum when divided by 4, you can add together the contributions from each cycle's sums. In other words, if you take the sum of the remainders for one cycle (1+2+3+0), you have your base unit which is 6, and indeed, when 6 is divided by 4, the remainder is 2. Considering this unit gets repeated twice in our full list from 1 to 12, effectively adding them up as (6+6)=12, the final remainder when this total is divided by 4 is still derived directly from its component parts: **the remainder of the sum is 2**.
