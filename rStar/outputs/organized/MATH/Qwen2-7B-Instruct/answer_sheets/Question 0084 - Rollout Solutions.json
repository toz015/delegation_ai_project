Let's break it down:\n\nGiven:\n\\[(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6.\\]\n\nExpanding both sides using distributive property, we get terms involving different powers of \\(t\\). To match coefficients on both sides, let's compare corresponding coefficients directly:\n\n- For \\(t^4\\) term, we see the coefficient is \\(12\\), so no need to adjust.\n- For \\(t^3\\) term, comparing coefficients yields \\(3b + 20 = 26\\).\n- For \\(t^2\\) term, considering how \\(t^2\\) comes about, we have \\(-6 + 5b - 2a = -8\\).\n- For \\(t\\) term, again combining like terms gives us \\(ab - 10 = -16\\).\n- For constant term, it's already accounted for as \\(a(-2) = 6\\).\n\nSolving:\n1.
