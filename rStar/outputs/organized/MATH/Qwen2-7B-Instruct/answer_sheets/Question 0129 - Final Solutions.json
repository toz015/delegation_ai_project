Then, using the area relationship (area = 1/2 * base * height), since $CD$ is the height and $AB$ is the base, $height = (2*Area)/base = (2*60)/17 = 24/17$. Because D is on AB, AD is part of AB so $AD = 17 - (BD)$. However, knowing that $BD = CD$ due to perpendicularity and creating 2 similar triangles (with heights CD and area of ACD being 1/3 of total area due to similarity ratio squared), we could also deduce $BD = DC = sqrt(AC^2 - CD^2) = sqrt((8)^2 - ((24/17))^2) = sqrt(64 - 576/289) = sqrt((64*289)-576)/289 = sqrt(18241 - 576)/289 = sqrt(17665)/289$.
