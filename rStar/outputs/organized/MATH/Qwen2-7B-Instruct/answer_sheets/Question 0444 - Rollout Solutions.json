Let $E$ be the midpoint of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$. It follows that triangles $AOE$, $BOC$, $COD$, and $DOA$ are congruent. Because each angle in a triangle is less than $180^\\circ$, point $E$ is farther from vertex $A$ than from $O$. Thus, every point inside triangle $EOB$ is closer to $O$ than to $A$ (or $C$). Similarly, every point inside triangle $DOC$ is closer to $O$ than to $B$ (or $D$). Thus, the region consisting of points closer to $O$ than to any vertex is the intersection of triangles $EOB$ and $DOC$.
