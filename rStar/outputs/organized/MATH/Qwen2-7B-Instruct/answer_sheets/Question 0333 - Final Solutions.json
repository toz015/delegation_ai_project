However, knowing key properties and historical expansions provides insight.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning.\nGiven typical approaches to finding \\(b\\), and acknowledging historical expansions, one might reason that due to the complexity and non-repetitiveness of the pattern for higher roots compared to square roots, direct calculation isn't simply a matter of applying a mechanical rule. Instead, it leans more on recognizing that certain elements repeat according to mathematical properties and theorems related to continued fractions.\n\nFor example, using the fact that the continued fraction representation of \\(\\sqrt[n]{k}\\) for natural numbers \\(n,k\\)", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{2} = a + \\cfrac{1}{b + \\cfrac{1}{c + \\cfrac{1}{d + \\dotsb}}},\\]where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ $d$ are positive integers, compute $b.$", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What does the equation represent?", "subanswer": {"text": "The equation represents the continued fraction representation of the cube root of 2, written as:\n\n\\[a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\cdots}}}\\]\n\nHere, $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, etc., are all positive integers. The sequence $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, ... continues indefinitely because it is a representation of the irrational number $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ through an infinite continued fraction.\n\nGiven that one of the questions asks for the value of $b$, and assuming that $a=1$ based on common knowledge (as seen with rational approximations of square roots like $\\sqrt{2}$, often represented as $1+\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2+\\ddots}}}$), the typical continued fraction representation of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$ would start:\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\dotsb}}}\\]\n\nWithout specific calculations or further context, we cannot precisely determine the exact numerical values for $b$, $c$, $d$, etc., but in the", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What is the pattern in the continued fraction representation of $\\sqrt[3]{2}$?", "subanswer": {"text": "The pattern involves repeatedly taking the integer part and continuing with the reciprocal of the remainder until it repeats.
