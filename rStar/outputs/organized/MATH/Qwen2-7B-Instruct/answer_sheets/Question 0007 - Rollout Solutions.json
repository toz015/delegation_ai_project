Let\u2019s say that the common value of $2x$, $3y$, and $-z$ is equal to some parameter $t$. Thus we can write:\n\n$$\n2x = t \\\\\n3y = t \\\\\n-z = t.\n$$\n\nNow let's solve each equation for $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{t}{2}, \\\\\ny = \\frac{t}{3}, \\\\\nz = -t.\n$$\n\nFrom this, it becomes clear that any point on the first line can be expressed as a linear combination of vectors that correspond to the coefficients of $t$ in the above expressions. That would make the direction vector of the first line proportional to the vector formed by those coefficients when arranged as follows:\n\n$$\n(x, y, z) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, -1).\n$$\n\nTherefore, without scaling, the direction vector of the first line is \n\n$$\n(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, -1),\n$$\n\nor", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The direction vector of the first line is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, -1 \\right)$.\n\nSimilarly, let's determine the direction vector of the second line described by $6x = -y = -4z$. Again, expressing everything in terms of a parameter $t$, we get:\n\n$$\n6x = t, \\\\\n-y = t, \\\\\n-4z = t.\n$$\n\nSolving for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we obtain:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{t}{6}, \\\\\ny = -t, \\\\\nz = -\\frac{t}{4}.\n$$\n\nConstructing a vector from these ratios,\n\n$$\n(x, y, z) = \\left( \\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\\frac{1}{4} \\right).\n$$\n\nThus, without scaling, the direction vector of the second line is\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\\frac{1}{4} \\right),\n$$\n\nor more conveniently written:", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy\n\\[2x = 3y = -z\\]is a line.\n\nThe set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy\n\\[6x = -y = -4z\\]is another line.\n\nFind the angle between these lines, in degrees.", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What are the direction vectors of the two lines based on their equations?", "subanswer": {"text": "Based on the given equations, the direction vector of the first line is $\\langle 3/2, 1, -1\\rangle$ and the direction vector of the second line is $\\langle -6, -1, 4\\rangle$.
