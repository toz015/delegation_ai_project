Remember that adding or subtracting multiples of \\(23\\) doesn't change the equivalence class mod \\(23\\). Hence,\n\n\\[ -1 \\equiv 22 \\mod(23) \\]\n\nSo our equation now becomes:\n\n\\[ t \\equiv 22 \\mod(23) \\]\n\nBut since \\(22\\) isn't odd, we look for an equivalent odd solution. Notice that \\(22 \\equiv -1 \\mod(23)\\), but considering only odd solutions, we consider \\(t = 22 - 2*23 = 22 - 46 = -24\\). Adjusting for positive values within the range using addition of multiple of \\(233\\ the modulus\\), we get, it:\n\n\\[", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
