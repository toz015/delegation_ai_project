Let $y = x^2$, so our equation becomes:\n\n$$ -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21 $$\n\nNow, we'll split this into two inequalities:\n\n1. $y^2 + 4y + 4 > -4$\n2. $y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0$\n\nSolve the quadratic inequalities one by one.\n\n**For the first inequality**, add 4 to both sides:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0 \\]\n\nThis inequality holds true for all \\(y\\) except when \\(y + 2 = 0\\), i.e., \\(y = -2\\). However, since \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(x^2\\) cannot take negative values, \\(y\\) is always greater than 0. Thus, this inequality doesn't restrict our domain further; it only tells us that \\(y \\neq -2\\).\n\n**For the second inequality**, move everything to one side:\n\n\\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 <", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
