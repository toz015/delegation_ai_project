Given that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we substitute these values into our equation:\n\n\\[210 \\times 210^3 = ab\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ab = 210^4\\]\n\nNow, remember that $a$ and $b$ share a greatest common divisor of $210$, meaning both $a$ and $b$ include the prime factors of $210$ within themselves. Therefore, $a$ is a multiple of $210$. To determine how many multiples of $210$ can fit into $210^4$, consider that each additional power of $210$ adds another zero to its prime factorization representation, because $210 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\cdot 5\\ =", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What does the prime factorization of $210$ look like?", "subanswer": {"text": "To find the prime factorization of $210$, let's start dividing it by the smallest prime number possible:\n\nStep 1: $210 \u00f7 2 = 105$\n\nNow, $105$ cannot be divided evenly by $2$, so we move onto the next prime number, which is $3$:\n\nStep 2: $105 \u00f7 3 = 35$\n\nNext, $35$ is not divisible by $3$, so we proceed with $5$:\n\nStep 3: $35 \u00f7 5 = 7$\n\nFinally, $7$ is a prime number itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the prime factorization of $210$ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Prime Factorization: } 210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What does the product of $210^3$ represent?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's break it down:\n\n\\[210^3\\] represents \\(210\\) multiplied by itself three times:\n\n\\[210 \\times 210 \\times 210.\\]\n\nThis could potentially represent calculating the volume of a cube whose side length is \\(210\\).
