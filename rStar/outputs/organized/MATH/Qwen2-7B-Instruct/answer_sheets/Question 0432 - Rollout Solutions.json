Thus, since the pattern repeats every 1985 steps ($f(1) = f(1986)$), the sum simplifies down to just considering $f(1)$, as every other term cancels out due to the alternating signs and the periodicity provided by $f(1) = f(1986)$. So the series reduces to finding a multiple of $f(1)$. The answer is that the entire sum reduces to multiples of $f(1)$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Knowing the relation, what's the final value of the series?", "subanswer": {"text": "To solve this problem, let's first use the given recursive formula to find \\(f(2), f(3),\\ldots,f(1986)\\) step by step starting from \\(f(1).\\)\n\nGiven that:\n\n\\[f(n + 1) = (-1)^{n + 1} n - 2f(n)\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[f(1) = f(1986)\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\(f(2)\\):\n\n\\[f(2) = (-1)^{2 + 1} 1 - 2f(1) = -1 - 2f(1)\\]\n\nNext, calculate \\(f(3)\\):\n\n\\[f(3) = (-1)^{3 + 1} 2 - 2f(2) = 2 - 2(-1 - 2f(1)) = 2 + 2 + 4f(1) = 4 + 4f(1)\\]\n\nThen, calculate \\(f(4)\\):\n\n\\[f(4) = (-1)^{4 + 1} 3 - 2f(3) = -3 - 2(4 + 4f(1)) = -", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Continuing this pattern reveals that for any odd index, the formula results in some multiple of \\(f(1)\\).
