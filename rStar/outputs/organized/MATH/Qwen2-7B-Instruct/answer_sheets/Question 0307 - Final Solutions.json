Thus, for $0^\\circ < x < 180^\\circ$, both $\\sin(x)$ and $\\sqrt{\\sin(x)}$ yield real results because $\\sin(x)$ is non-negative within our specified domain. \n\nNow, look into the logarithmic part $y=\\log_2(\\sqrt{\\sin(x)})$. When you take the log base 2 of any value from 0 to infinity (since we've established $\\sqrt{\\sin(x)}$'s range is valid for this operation), the output ranges over all negative real numbers as well as zero since $\\log_2(1) = 0$ and $\\log_2(x)$ becomes arbitrarily negative as $x$ approaches 0 from above (because taking logs of very small positive numbers yields large negative numbers). \n\nHence, the range of the function $y = \\log_2(\\sqrt{\\", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "What is the range of the function $y=\\log_2 (\\sqrt{\\sin x})$ for $0^\\circ< x < 180^\\circ$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What is the domain of the square root function $\\sqrt{\\sin x}$ for $0^\\circ< x < 180^\\circ$?", "subanswer": {"text": "The domain of $\\sqrt{\\sin x}$ within $0^\\circ< x < 180^\\circ$ is where $\\sin x \\geq 0$, which occurs between $0^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$.
