Daniel's claim translates into the equation \\(S \\cdot C = k\\), where \\(k\\) is a constant of proportionality.", "2": "Given that when \\(C=1500\\) dollars, \\(S=15\\) customers bought it, we can solve for \\(k\\) as follows: \\(15 \\times 1500 = k\\)."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, calculate the constant of proportionality \\(k\\) using the initial information given. According to the hint, we plug the known values into the equation \\(S \\cdot C = k\\):\n\n\\[15 \\times 1500 = k\\]\n\nSo, \n\n\\[k = 22500.\\]\n\nAccording to Daniel's claim, the popularity (number of sales) is inversely proportional to the cost of the television, which could be expressed as:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{k}{C}.\\]\n\nGiven that we're looking for the number of customers (\\(S\\)) who would buy a television costing $\\$$2500, we substitute \\(C = 2500\\) and \\(k = 22500\\) into our equation:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{22500}{2500}.\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n\\[S = 9.\\]\n\nTherefore, according to Daniel's theory, \\(\\boxed{9}\\) customers would buy a television that costs $\\$$2500. The answer is: 9.\n\nHuman beings have developed various types of methods to control the spread of infectious diseases such as smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis,", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
