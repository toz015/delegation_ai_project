The answer is finding such an integer.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the modular inverse of $997$ modulo $1000$. That is, we seek an integer $x$ such that:\n\n\\[997 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1000}\\]\n\nThis means that when we multiply $997$ by some integer $x$ and divide the product by $1000$, the remainder is $1$. Let\u2019s use the Extended Euclidean algorithm to find this solution.\n\nStep 1: Perform the division to break down $1000$ into powers of $2$.\n\n- $1000 = 2^3 * 125$\n\nStep 2: Now express $997$ in terms of powers of $2$ and $125$.\n- $997 = 2^3 + 3 * 125 - 1$\n  \nSo now,\n\\[997 = 2^3 + 3*125 - 1\\]\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse we're looking for, let it be $x$: \n\\[997x = (2^3 + 3*1 +times)*", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
