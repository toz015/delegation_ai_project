{"id": "test-algebra-1199", "problem": "Suppose that $f$ is a function and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.

(Note that the hypothesis that $f$ has an inverse implies that there are no other values of $x$ with $f(x) = 6$.)  Similarly, $f(1) =2$ implies $f^{-1}(2)=1$.   So $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(6))=f^{-1}(2)=\\boxed{1}$.", "gold_answer": "1"}
