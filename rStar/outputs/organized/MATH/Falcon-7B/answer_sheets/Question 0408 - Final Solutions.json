There are $x^2 + 1$ conditions, $x = -1$ conditions, and $x = 1$ conditions. We need to check each condition separately. For the first condition (x^2 + 1), there are $x = -1, x = 1, x = 0, and x = 1/5. We can simplify this as $x = -1 + 2^x$. So, the answer for this condition is $(2,-2)$. For the second condition (x = -1), there are two options: $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. We can check these conditions separately. For the first condition, we see that $x = -1$ satisfies the condition. For the second condition, we see that $x = -1$ does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer is $(2,-2) for this condition.
