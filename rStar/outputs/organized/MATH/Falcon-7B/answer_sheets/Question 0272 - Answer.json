{"id": "test-number_theory-533", "problem": "If $0.\\overline{1331}$ is written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ with $a$ and $b$ being positive integers with a greatest common divisor of 1, what is $a+b$?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let $x = 0.\\overline{1331}$, so $10000x = 1331.\\overline{1331}$. As a result, $9999x = 1331$, so $x = \\frac{1331}{9999}$. We can factor out 11 out of both the numerator and denominator, so $x = \\frac{121}{909}$. Thus $a+b=121+909 = \\boxed{1030}$.", "gold_answer": "1030"}
