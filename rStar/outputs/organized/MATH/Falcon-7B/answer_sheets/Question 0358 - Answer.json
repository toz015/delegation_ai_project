So, we suspect this equation defines an $\\boxed{\\text{ellipse}}$. To verify this we write \\[\\left(\\frac x2 - 3\\right)^2 = \\frac 14 \\left( x - 6\\right)^2,\\]and we see that the equation \\[ \\frac{\\left(x - 6 \\right)^2}{4} + y^2 = 10 \\]is the equation of an ellipse.", "gold_answer": "\\text{ellipse}"}
