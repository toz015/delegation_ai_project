Then we subtract $6$ from the $y$ coordinate: $2 = -4$. Answer: (2,-4). Therefore, if they sell all the cartons, there will be $2$ left. The answer is: $2$.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If 4 daps = 7 yaps, and 5 yaps = 3 baps, how many daps equal 42 baps?", "ost_step": {"1": "A dap is 1/4 of a yap. Therefore, 4 daps equal 1 yap."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Since 4 daps are equal to 1 yap, 1 yap is equal to 1/4 daps. We know that 4 daps = 7 yaps. Therefore, 1 yap = 7/4. Also, we know that 7 yaps = 42 baps. Therefore, 1 yap = 42/7. Solving the two equations, we get $1 = 42$ and $1/1 = 42$. Therefore, the answer is: 42.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
