To solve this problem, we will use a technique called substitution. In this particular case, we want to know the number of solutions for $5 + 3$. We can write this problem as $5 + 3 = 8$. Now, we want to solve for $8$. We can do this by combining the two equations. This gives us $8 = 5 + 3$. To solve this equation, we need to find the number of solutions to $5 + 3$. One way to do this is to separate the variables. We can then factor out $8$ and simplify the resulting equation. There are two solutions for $5 + 3 = 8$ because $8 = 4*2$.
