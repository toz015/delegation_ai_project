{"id": "test-algebra-529", "problem": "The sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is $3^7$. What is their median?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The median of a set of consecutive positive integers is equal to the mean of the set of integers.  Therefore, we can find the median by dividing the sum by the number of integers: $3^7/3^3=3^4=\\boxed{81}$.", "gold_answer": "81"}
