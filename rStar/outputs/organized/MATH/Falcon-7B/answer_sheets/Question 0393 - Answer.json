{"id": "test-algebra-518", "problem": "It's a well-known physics formula that force equals mass times acceleration.  Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball.  If the softball has a mass of $200$ g and the baseball has a mass of $150$ g, what is the ratio of acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's?  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If $j_1$ is the acceleration of Jen's ball and $j_2$ is the acceleration of Jack's ball, then we have $$j_1 \\cdot 200 = j_2 \\cdot 150\\qquad \\Rightarrow\\qquad \\frac{j_1}{j_2} = \\boxed{\\frac 34}.$$", "gold_answer": "\\frac 34"}
