Since the cost of paint is proportional to the surface area of the painted material, the cost of the paint is proportional to the volume of the painted material. Since we want the paint to cover the entire surface area of the cube, the cost of the paint is proportional to the volume of the cube. The formula to calculate the cost of paint per cubic inch is: $C = V * P$ with $C$ being the cost of the paint, $V$ being the volume of the painted material, and $P$ being the price per cubic inch of paint. To determine the price per inch of surface area, we can calculate the price per cubic inch of paint: $P = V * P$ with $V$ being the volume of the painted material, which is proportional to $\\boxed{2}$.
