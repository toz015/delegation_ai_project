Therefore, if $\\alpha = \\boxed{2}$ and $y = \\boxed{2}$ and $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ then the answer is: $z = \\boxed{2}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is $y$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Substituting $y = \\boxed{2}$ into the given equation results in $z = \\boxed{2}$.
