{"id": "test-algebra-791", "problem": "Positive integers $a$, $b$, and $2009$, with $a<b<2009$, form a geometric sequence with an integer ratio. What is $a$?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The prime factorization of $2009$ is $2009 = 7\\cdot 7\\cdot 41$. As $a<b<2009$, the ratio must be positive and larger than $1$. Hence, there is only one possibility: the ratio must be $7$, and thus $b=7\\cdot 41$ and $a=\\boxed{41}$.", "gold_answer": "41"}
