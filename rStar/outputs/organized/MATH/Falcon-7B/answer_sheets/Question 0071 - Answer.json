In this case, we begin by noticing that the last three digits are worth $110_2=6_8$. The next block of three digits is $001_2=1_8$. Continuing, we find that the next two digits (moving right-to-left) are $101_2=5_8$ and $010_2=2_8$. Altogether, we find that $10101001110_{2}=\\boxed{2516_8}$.", "gold_answer": "2516_8"}
