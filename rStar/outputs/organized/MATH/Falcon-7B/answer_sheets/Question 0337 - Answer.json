{"id": "test-prealgebra-1730", "problem": "The product of three consecutive integers is 120. That product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. What is the largest of the three consecutive integers?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Call the integers $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Their mean is $n$; their product is $(n-1)(n)(n+1)=120$ and their product divided by their mean is $(n-1)(n+1)=24$. Dividing the first equation by the second, we get $n=5$. The largest of the three is $n+1=\\boxed{6}$.", "gold_answer": "6"}
