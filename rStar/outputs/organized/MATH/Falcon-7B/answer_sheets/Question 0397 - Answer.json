{"id": "test-prealgebra-977", "problem": "If $3x + 2(1 + x) = 17$, what is the value of $6x + 5$?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Expanding and collecting terms on the left hand side of the first equation gives $5x+2=17$. Subtracting 2 from each side gives $5x=15$, then dividing each side by 5 gives $x=3$. Now that we know what $x$ is, we can substitute it into $6x+5$ and get $6(3)+5=18+5=\\boxed{23}$.", "gold_answer": "23"}
