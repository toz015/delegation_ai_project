We want to find the smallest integer in the set of integers $x$ where $|x-2|\\leq5.6$. The set of integers can be written as $[2,3,5]$. If $x$ satisfies the condition $|x-2|\\leq5.6$, then we need to check if $x$ is in the set. If $x$ is in the set, we can set $|x-2|=0$. If $x$ is not in the set, we can set $|x-2|\\leq5.6$ and $x$ can be any integer in the set. Therefore, the solution set is $[2,3,5]$. The smallest integer in the set is $2$. Therefore, the answer is: $2$.", "value": 0.4375}}}, "rollout_id": 5}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "How many integers are in the solution set of $|x-2|\\leq5.6$ ?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What is the smallest integer in the set?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
