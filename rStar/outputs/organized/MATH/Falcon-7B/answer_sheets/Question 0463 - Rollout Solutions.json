The square of the $x$ variable is: $x^2 = x+2$. Since $x^2 - 6$ is defined, it is a constant and can be substituted into this expression. So, $x^2 - 6 = x+2$ is equivalent to: $x - 2 = 6$. However, $x - 2 = 4$ and not $6$. Therefore, the first condition is not met. Let's try the second condition: $x - 2 = 6$. Here, $x - 2 = 4$. We know that $x - 4 = 2$. So, $x = 2 + 2$.
