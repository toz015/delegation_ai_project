The first equation in the list is $(x,y,z,etc.)$, which means $x,y,z,etc.$ must be a function of each other. Here is an example: $(2,4) = 2$. Now we can use substitution to find the equation of the other variables. For example, $(1,2) = 3$. We can keep going like this to find the other variables. After substituting in the system, we have $(2+4,3,x,y,z,etc.) = 5$. Therefore, $x,y,z,etc.$ are functions of $t$. Therefore, we have $4$ equations in the system.
