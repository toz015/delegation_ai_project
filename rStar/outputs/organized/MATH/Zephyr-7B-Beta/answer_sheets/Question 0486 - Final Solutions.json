The shortest distance between opposite corners of the sphere is the diameter, which is twice the radius. Since the sphere is being carved out of the cube, the sphere's diameter fits inside each edge of the cube. This means that the sphere touches all six faces of the cube. Let's call the edge length of the cube $x$. Since the sphere touches all six faces, it's also touching the corners. This gives us a right triangle with legs of $x$ and hypotenuse of $3$. By Pythagorean theorem, we know that the height of the triangle is $\\sqrt{x^2-(3/2)^2}$.

The radius of the sphere is 3/2 inch. Hence, the diameter is 3 inches, and so the radius of the circle formed by cutting off each corner is 1.5 inches.

Now, since the edges of the original cube meet at right angles, we can see that the corners form a smaller cube inside the larger one.
