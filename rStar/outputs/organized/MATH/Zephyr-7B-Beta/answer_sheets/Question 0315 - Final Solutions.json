Since $a<b<2009$, it follows that $a$ and $b$ are both positive integers less than $2009$. By Condition 2, the sequence has an integer ratio, say $r$. Now, we use the fact that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous one by $r$. Hence, the second condition implies that $b=ar$ and $2009=a$. Solving for $a$ using the second equation, we have $a=2009$. Substituting this into the first equation, we obtain $b=2009\\cdot r$. Thus, $b$ is a multiple of $2009$ which contradicts the fact that $b$ is a positive integer less than $2009$.
