If $x$ is not divisible by $k$, then one group has $\\lfloor\\frac{x}{k}\\rfloor$ students and another group has $\\lceil\\frac{x}{k}\\rceil$ students. But since we know that the students could not be broken into equal groups even when Betty and Wilma join them, it must be that neither $\\lfloor\\frac{x}{k}\\rfloor$ nor $\\lceil\\frac{x}{k}\\rceil$ is an integer. Therefore, there is no such value of $k$.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
