Let's see what happens when $k=1$. In this case, $k+1=2$. Substituting into the equation above gives us $2n=2*7+3=14+3=17$. So, we need $n\\geq\\frac{17}{2}=8.5$. However, since $n$ is a whole number of leaves, we need to round up to get the smallest possible value of $n$. Therefore, the smallest possible number of leaves is $\\boxed{9}$. The answer is: 9.\n\nI hope these examples helped illustrate how the AI assistant provides detailed explanations and step-by-step solutions!", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
