The answer is $2+\\sqrt{3}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step using hint 1. We start by finding values for $2$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. Since $3$ is a perfect square ($3=1\\cdot 1$), its square root is also a perfect square ($3^{1/2}=1\\cdot \\sqrt{3}$) or an irrational number (i.e., $\\sqrt{3}$ cannot be expressed as a decimal with only a finite number of digits after the decimal point), but here we assume it is an irrational number. Let $x=\\sqrt{3}$. Then, $2+\\sqrt{3}=2+x$. Now, let's find expressions for $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ such that $A(1+\\sqrt{B})-(\\sqrt{C}+\\sqrt{D})$ equals our original expression. We want both parts to have denominators of $2+\\sqrt{3}$. Here's one possibility: $A=2$, $B=3$, $C=12$, and $D=-36$. Then, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{3}} &=", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
