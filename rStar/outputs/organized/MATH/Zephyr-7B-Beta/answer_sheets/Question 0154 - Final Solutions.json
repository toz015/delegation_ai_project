To calculate the shortest path, the gecko can either follow the wall to reach the fly or it can climb the ceiling and reach the fly directly.

The path the gecko takes along the ceiling follows a straight line segment with slope $0$, i.e., it follows the $x$-axis. So the equation of this path is $y=8$.
