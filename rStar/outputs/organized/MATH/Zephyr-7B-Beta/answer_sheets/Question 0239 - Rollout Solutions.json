Let's start with the first parallelogram. The slopes of the parallel sides are $m_1=a$ and $m_2=b$. Since they're parallel, their slopes are equal.

Because the lines are parallel, the base and height of each parallelogram are also parallel. Let's call the common height $h$. Then, we can write the expressions for the bases: $base_1=(d-c)/b$, $base_2=-(d-c)/a$, and $base_3=(d-c)/b$, $base_4=-(d-c)/a$. Using the fact that the areas are known, we have $18=bh$ and $72=bh$. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get $h=6$ and $h=12$. The smallest possible value of $h$ is 6, so let's use it. Plugging $h=6$ into one of the area formulas, we obtain $18=6b$, which leads us to $b=3$. Now, we know that the height and base of the first parallelogram are $h=6$ and $base_1=(d-c)/b$. Substituting $b=3$, we get $base_1=(d-c)/3$. Similarly, the height and base of", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
