Since $42!$ contains all the integers from 1 to 42, it can be written as $42\\cdot 41\\cdot 40\\cdots 2\\cdot 1$. Now, let's focus on finding how many zeros appear at the end of this number. Whenever we multiply a number by 10, the digits stay the same but the decimal point moves one place to the right. If we continue doing this enough times, the decimal point will eventually move out of our field of view, meaning that there will be trailing zeros. To count the number of trailing zeros, we look at the prime factorization of the number. For example, $10 = 2\\cdot 5$. When we multiply $10$ enough times, some zeros will be added to the end. Let's apply this concept to our problem. The number 42 has no factors other than 1 and itself, so it won't contribute any trailing zeros. But both 41 and 40 have 5 as a factor.
