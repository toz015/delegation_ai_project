By hypothesis, the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. That is, $r_1r_2\\cdots r_n=\\dfrac{a_0}{a_n}=11$. Using the hint, let's write this product using the root variables: $(r_1)(r_2)\\cdots(r_n)=11$. Now, using the fact that the product of the roots is the same as the product of their absolute values, we get $(|r_1|)(|r_2|)\\cdots(|r_n|)=11$. By hypothesis, the roots are distinct integers, so each $|r_i|$ is equal to 1 or the opposite of another root; say, $|r_i|=r_j$ or $|r_i|=-r_k$. In either case, $|r_i|$ is one of the integers among $r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n$.
