Now, let's find the number of seatings when the fixed seats are Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas. Without loss of generality, let's say that Pierre sits in seat 1, Rosa sits in seat 2, and Thomas sits in seat 3. Then, the remaining 5 people can sit in any order around the table. So, there are $5!$ ways to arrange them. Now, we need to count the rotations. Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are fixed, the rotations involve only the other 5 people. Each rotation moves each person around the table a certain number of seats. So, there are $2\\cdot 5$ rotations. Putting it all together, the number of possible seatings is $5!\\cdot 2\\cdot 5=240$.
