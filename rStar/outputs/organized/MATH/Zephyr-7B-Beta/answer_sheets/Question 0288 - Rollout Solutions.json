The point $(-3,1)$ satisfies this equation when $t = 0.$ So, the parametric equations are $(x,y) = (-3,1) + t[2,5].$ This means that the line passes through any point $(x,y)$ that is obtained by moving $t$ units along the direction vector $[2,5]$ from the point $(-3,1).$ The answer is $(x,y) = (-3,1) + t[2,5].$", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Condition 2:  A second line is defined by the equation $y=-2x.$ Which condition describes a vertical line passing through the point $(5,2)?$\n\nHint 2: Which line passes through the point $(x,y)$ and has slope undefined? For a vertical line, the independent variable is the $x$-coordinate. So, this line is described by the equation $x=k,$ where $k$ represents the $x$-coordinate of any point on the line. The given point $(5,2)$ lies on this vertical line, so substituting $5$ into the equation for the line gives us $x=5,$ which is equivalent to saying that the $x$-coordinate of any point on this line is $5.$ Therefore, the equation of the vertical line passing through $(5,2)$ is $x=5.$ The answer is: $x=5.$", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "One line is defined by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -10 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} + t \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -9 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]Another line is defined by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 6 \\end{pmatrix} + u \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ -18 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}.\\]These two lines are parallel.

To find the direction vector of the first line, we subtract the starting point from the endpoint: $(3, -10, 1) - (0, 0, 0) = (3, -10, 1) = v$. For the second line, the starting point is $(-5, -3, 6)$, so the endpoint is $(-1, 3, 2)$. Subtracting the starting point from the endpoint, we get $(2, -6, -4) = w$.
