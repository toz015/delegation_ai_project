What is $x$ when $y=3$?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. When $x=24$ and $y=15$, we know that $y$ varies inversely as $\\sqrt x$. In other words, $y\\cdot\\sqrt x=k$, where $k$ is a constant. Replacing $x=24$ and $y=15$ in this formula, we obtain $15\\cdot\\sqrt{24}=k$. Isolating $\\sqrt x$, we get $\\sqrt x=\\dfrac{15}{\\sqrt{24}}$. To find $x$ when $y=3$, we use the same formula, but replace $x$ and $y$ accordingly: $3\\cdot\\sqrt x=\\dfrac{15}{\\sqrt{24}}$. Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{24}$, we get $3\\sqrt{24}\\sqrt x=15$. Finally, isolating $\\sqrt x$, we have $\\sqrt x=\\dfrac{15}{3\\sqrt{24}}$, and squaring both sides, we have $\\boxed{x=225/72}$. The answer is: 225/72.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
