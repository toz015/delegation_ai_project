To find the domain of a function, we need to find the set of x-values for which the function is defined. Here, our function is defined using division by a quantity under the radical symbol. So, we check if the denominator is ever zero or negative. Let's calculate the discriminant: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x^2 - 5x) + 6 = (-5)(x)(x) + 6 = b^2 - 4ac$. If the discriminant is negative, the expression inside the square root sign is not real. In fact, it's a nonreal number because its square would produce a negative value. So, we need to make sure that the discriminant is always nonnegative. To do so, we set the discriminant to zero and solve for $x$. Then, we compare the result with the expression's coefficients. After some algebra, we get $x^2-5x+6=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=\\frac{5\\pm\\sqrt{25-24}}{2} = \\frac{5\\pm3}{2} =", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "What is the domain of the real-valued function $f(x)=\\frac{2x-7}{\\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}}$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Under what conditions would the denominator of the fraction equal zero?", "subanswer": {"text": "The denominator of a fraction is equal to zero when the bottom term of the fraction is zero.

To find when the denominator equals zero, we set it equal to zero: $\\sqrt{x^2-5x+6}=0$. Now, we need to check whether this equation represents a valid condition. When the square root of a negative number is taken, we say that the value of the square root is imaginary. However, since the function asks for a real-valued function, we cannot accept this possibility here. Therefore, inside the square root sign, the expression $x^2-5x+6$ cannot be negative. For this reason, it must be greater than or equal to zero: $x^2-5x+6\\geq0$. This inequality represents a parabola in the coordinate plane.
