To find how much of the pie Louis and Jack consume altogether, we need to add the amounts consumed by both of them. Louis consumes $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the whole pie, so his consumption is $\\frac{1}{5}$ times the entire pie. Similarly, Jack consumes $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the remaining pie. Let's call the size of the whole pie $P$. Then Louis consumes $\\frac{1}{5} P$ and Jack consumes $\\frac{2}{3}$ times what's left over after Louis eats. To calculate how much of the pie Jack eats, let's call the remaining part $R$. After Louis eats, we have $P-R$ left for Jack to eat. So Jack eats $\\frac{2}{3}$ of this: $\\frac{2}{3}$ of $P-R$. Now let's substitute $R$ using the fact that Louis ate $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the whole pie: $R=P-\\frac{1}{5} P=\\frac{4}{5} P$.
