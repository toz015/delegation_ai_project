Since the points are chosen randomly and independently, each central angle is equally likely to occur. Thus, the probability that a random arc measures less than a certain value is the same as the probability that a random number less than that value is chosen from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2$\\pi$.\n\nTo calculate the length of arc $AB$, we need the central angle $\\theta_{AB}$. Let's say the angles at $A$ and $B$ are $a$ and $b$ respectively. If we draw the line segment connecting points $A$ and $B$, it forms chords $AC$ and $BC$. Since the lengths of these chords are known ($d_{AC}$ and $d_{BC}$), we can find the lengths of the corresponding arcs ($l_{AC}$ and $l_{BC}$) using similar triangles.
