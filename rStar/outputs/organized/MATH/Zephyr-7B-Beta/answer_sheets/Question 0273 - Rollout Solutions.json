First, let's convert the price of gelato in Italy to dollars using the conversion rate in 1992: $1\\text{ USD} = 1726.2\\text{ lire}$. This means that one dollar was worth 1726.2 Italian lire. Now, let's use this conversion rate to find out how much 1200 lire were worth in US Dollars: $1200\\text{ Lire} = \\frac{1200\\text{ Lire}}{1726.2\\text{ Lire}/\\text{USD}} \\approx \\$0.70$.\n\nNow, let's find out how many US dollars were worth 1 million lire back then. Since 1 US Dollar was worth 1726.2 lire, we can divide $1\\text{ Million Lira}$ by $1726.2\\text{ Lira}/\\text{USD}$: $1,000,000\\text{ Lire} = \\frac{1,000,0", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
