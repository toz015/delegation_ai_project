However, since the degree of the numerator (12) is greater than the degree of the denominator (10), the Degree Test for Horizontal Asymptotes does not directly apply here. Instead, we need to check if there's any real number such that the degree of the polynomial in the denominator is strictly greater than the degree of the polynomial in the numerator. Indeed, setting $3x^3-2x^2+5x-1=0$ and solving for x, we get $x=-1/3$ or $x=\\infty$ or $x=\\infty$ again. The latter two cases correspond to the denominator becoming infinitely large. In fact, it follows that $|x|^k$ becomes infinitely larger than $cx^m$ as $x$ approaches positive or negative infinity whenever $k>m$. Therefore, the function behaves like $4x^9/(3x^{10})$ as $x$ approaches infinity or minus infinity, which tends to zero because the degrees of both polynomials are different but $k > m$.
