Since quadrilateral CDEG is a square, its diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at right angles. Also, since E is the midpoint of diagonal AC, it follows that E is also the midpoint of diagonal BD.

Furthermore, since EF is one of the base of the parallelogram, we have EF = BD - ED = 3 - 1.5 = \\boxed{1.5} (because ED = EC = 3/2).

Using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle DEF, we see that DF = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(16) = 4.
