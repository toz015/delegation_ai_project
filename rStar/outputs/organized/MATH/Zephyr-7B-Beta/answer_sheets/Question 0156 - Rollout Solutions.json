Then the distance $OP_A$ covered by Runner $A$ is $d_{OP_A} = 3 \\times 1800 = 5400 m$ and the distance $OB_A$ covered by Runner $B$ is $d_{OB_A} = 3 \\times 5400 = 16200 m$. Therefore, $OP_A = OB_A$. Since the speeds of both runners are constant, let their respective speeds be $v_A$ and $v_B$. So, we have $|v_A| = \\frac{5400}{3} = 1800 m/min$ and $|v_B| = 3|v_A|$. Using Pythagoras theorem on right angled triangles $AOP$ and $BOCP$, we have $(5400 - |v_B|t)^2 + (1800 t)^2 = 16200^2$ and $(1800 t)^2 + (1800 t)^2 = 16200^2$. Equating the squares of the common side, we get $5400 - |v_B|t = 16200$. Simplifying this gives us $|v_B| = 24000 - 1800t$. Since $|v_B| > 0$, $t < \\frac{24000}{1800} = 13\\frac{1}{3}$ minutes. So, Runner $B$ takes less than 13$\\frac{1}{3}$ minutes to cover the remaining distance $16200 - 5400 = 10800 m$.
