Among the possible values of $t$ that satisfy this condition, we further have:\n\n- For $t=1$: $t+2=3$ is not invertible modulo 23, since 23 does not divide into 3.\n- For $3 \\le t \\le 21$: By trial and error, it is easy to see that no such integer $t+2$ exists, since all such integers are either too small or too big compared to the size of the prime 23.\n- For $t=23$: Here, $t+2=-1$. Since the inverse of -1 modulo 23 does not exist, Condition 3 is violated.\n\nTherefore, there is no value of $t$ that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. Hence, the answer to the question is: No such value of $t$ exists.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
