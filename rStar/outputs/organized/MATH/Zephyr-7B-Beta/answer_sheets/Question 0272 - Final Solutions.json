Question: How many times does the repeating decimal digit of this fraction appear in its expanded form when it is expressed as an integer multiple of itself?\n\nHint 2: What digit appears after the decimal point when this fraction is expressed as a decimal number? Let's think step by step. Since this fraction is expressed as an integer multiple of its repeating decimal digit, let's call this integer multiple $m$. When this fraction is multiplied by 12, it becomes an integer: $\\frac{a}{b}\\times 12=c$. Expanding this expression, we get: $a\\times c = b\\times 12$. Now, let's find out how many times the repeating decimal digit appears in this expression. Well, since this fraction is expressed as an integer multiple of its repeating decimal digit, the digit will appear once in the first term ($a$). But, this digit will also appear in each subsequent term because every time we multiply by 12, one more digit appears. Therefore, the digit appears $c$ times in this expansion.
