After arranging the first letter 'E', we are left with 'LLIPES'. We can arrange the second letter 'L' in 2 ways (at the beginning or somewhere else). After fixing the second letter, we are left with 'LLIEPSE'. Now, we can arrange the third letter 'L' in 3 ways (the second 'L' could be either the third or fourth or fifth letter). Continuing like this, we see that we can arrange 'L' in each position until we get to the seventh position. The seventh letter is 'E', so we can arrange it in only one way.
