Solving for x: $x = 18 - 235 = -217$. But since we cannot have negative representatives, we need to subtract the difference of the representatives from the 7th grade and the actual representatives of the 8th grade from the total number of representatives: $-217 - 235 = -452$. Subtracting the difference from the total number of representatives, we get: $18 - (-452) = \\boxed{464}$.
