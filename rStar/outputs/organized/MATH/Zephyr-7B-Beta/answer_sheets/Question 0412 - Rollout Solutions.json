Thus, $P(x)$ is obtained by shifting the quadratic $x^2$ upward by $3$ units and downward by $2x^2-4x$ units, so that its discriminant is negative. This shift can also be done by multiplying $x^2$ by a constant factor, which is $1/(2a)$, followed by adding a constant term of $-3/(4a)+b/(4a)-1/(4a)$ (which makes the graph pass through $(1,181)$), as shown below: $$P(x)=((1/(2a))x^2)-(3/(4a))x+(1/(4a))$$ To calculate $a, b,$ and $c$ explicitly using the information provided, we substitute $x=11$ into the inequality $x^2 - 2x + 2 \\le P(x) \\le 2x^2 - 4x + 3$ and equate the bounds with $P(11)$: \\begin{align*} 121 - 22 + 2 &\\le ((1/(2a))*121)^2-((3/(4a))*11)^2+((1/(4a))*181)\\\\ &\\le 2*(121^2)-4*(121)*1\\\\ &\\text{Solving for }a:\\quad\\frac{1}{2} \\le ((1/(2a))*121)^2-\\left(( \\frac{3}{4a}) * 11\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{4a}\\right)*181\\\\ &\\text{Taking square roots of the inequality and simplifying:} \\quad|121| \\le |2a|*|\\sqrt{1-\\frac{19}{121}}|*\\sqrt{\\", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is $P(16)$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Using the calculated values of $a, b,$ and $c$ and substituting $x=16$ into $P(x)$ yields the answer: $P(16)=\\boxed{409}$.
