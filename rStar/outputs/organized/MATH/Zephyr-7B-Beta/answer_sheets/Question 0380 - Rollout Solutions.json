To simplify our lives, let's consider two cases: when $x^2 - 81$ is nonnegative, and when it is negative. When $x^2 - 81$ is nonnegative, the absolute value expression collapses to just $x^2 - 81$. When $x^2 - 81$ is negative, the absolute value expression becomes $-(x^2 - 81)$, since the negative sign is outside the absolute value bars. Now let's analyze the inequality. Inside the absolute value bars, $x^2 - 81$ is either nonnegative or negative. When $x^2 - 81$ is nonnegative, the inside expression of the inequality is less than zero, which is impossible since any number less than zero cannot be less than another number. When $x^2 - 81$ is negative, the inside expression becomes $-(x^2 - 81)$, and we have to compare this expression with zero. Since $x^2 - 81$ is negative, then $x^2$ and $", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
