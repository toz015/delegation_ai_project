By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two consecutive blocks of bits with different values. These blocks of bits could be 1's followed by 0's, or vice versa. Without loss of generality, assume the first block consists of 1's, and let its length be $m$. Then, the next block can have at most $12 - m$ 1's in order to satisfy the requirement that the last digit is 1 as well. Since each digit of the second block can be either 0 or 1, the total number of possible configurations for the second block is $2^{12-m}$. However, not all of these configurations correspond to a valid multiple of 450. Specifically, any configuration that does not end in 1's would fail to be a valid multiple of 450. Therefore, there are only $2^{12-m} - (2^{12-m-1}-1)$ valid configurations for the second block (subtracting the number of invalid configurations ending in 0's from the total number of configurations).
