Let's try finding the 10th term of the sequence using the pattern we've observed:\n\nThe first term is 0, so the common difference ($d$) is 1. The second term is 1, so the first multiple ($m$) is also 1. The next term is produced by adding $md$, which is $1*1=1$. Continuing in this way, the 9th term is produced by adding $md$ nine times: $9*(1*1)=9$. Since we want the 10th term, we need to add one more time: $10*(1*1)=10$.
