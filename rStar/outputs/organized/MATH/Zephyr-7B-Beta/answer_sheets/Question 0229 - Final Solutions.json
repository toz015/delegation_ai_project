Since they cannot pick the same dish as the other person, each person has to choose from the remaining 9 dishes. By condition 4, the order doesn't matter. This is the concept of combinations where we select k items from n items without replacement. Thus, the number of ways Yann can choose his dish is $\\binom{9}{1}=9$. Similarly, Camille also has $\\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways to choose her dish. Therefore, each person has $\\boxed{9}$ choices if they cannot pick the same dish as the other person. The answer is: 9.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many total choices are possible for Yann and Camille to choose from?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since the order doesn't matter, there are $\\binom{10}{2}$ ways in which they can choose their meals, i.e., $10C2$.
