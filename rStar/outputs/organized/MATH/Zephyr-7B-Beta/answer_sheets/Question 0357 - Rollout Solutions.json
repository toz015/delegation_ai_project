We know that the number of ways we can choose $5$ cards from $54$ is ${54}\\choose{5} = 11,440$. We also know that the remaining $54 - 5 = 59$ cards can be distributed among the other $(x-1)$ players, each receiving at least $5$ cards. Let's call the number of ways we can do this $f(x)$, where $x > 1$. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:\n\nNumber of ways to distribute the remaining cards:\n\n$$ f(x) = {59}\\choose{5(x-1)} - {59}\\choose{5(x-2)} + ... - {59}\\choose{5(x-1)-5} + {59}\\choose{5(x-1)-10} $$\n\nWe add terms because some players might receive more than $5$ cards. Since each term is negative except for the last one, we can rewrite the equation:\n\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{10", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
