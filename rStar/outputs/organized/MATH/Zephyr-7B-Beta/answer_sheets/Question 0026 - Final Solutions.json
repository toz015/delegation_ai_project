First, let's label the seats around the table as $1, 2, 3, ..., 7$. Since we know that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas cannot occupy adjacent seats, we need to make sure they are not next to each other. There are $4!$ ways to arrange the remaining four people, but we need to subtract the arrangements that violate our condition. Here, we have three cases to consider. Case 1: Pierre sits at seat 1. In this case, Rosa and Thomas cannot sit at seats 2 and 3, respectively. So, we have $2!$ ways to arrange the remaining two people at seats 4 and 5. After arranging the people at seats 1, 4, and 5, we can arrange the remaining person at any of the remaining four seats. So, the total number of arrangements in this case is $(1)(4)(2!)=16$.
