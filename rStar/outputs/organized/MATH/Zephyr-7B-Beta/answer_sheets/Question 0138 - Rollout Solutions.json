The answer is $\\frac{1}{36}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "What is the probability that the contents of their bags are now identical?", "subanswer": {"text": "This happens only if Alice and Bob each end up with a ball of each color. In other words, Alice has to pick the right ball and put it into Bob's bag and then Bob has to pick the remaining ball of the same color that he didn't have at first.
