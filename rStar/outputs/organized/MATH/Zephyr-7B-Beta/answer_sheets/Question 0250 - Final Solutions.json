Thus, the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other. So the slope is $-\\frac{1}{4}$, which means that $m = -\\frac{1}{4}$. The answers are $b$ (for the $y$-intercept), $-4b$ (for the $x$-intercept), and $-\\frac{1}{4}$ (for the slope).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The sum of the values represented by $a$, $b$, and $m$ is: $a + b - 4b = b(1 - 4) = -3b$. Since we don't know the actual values of $a$, $b$, and $m$, we cannot determine the exact sum. However, we know that it depends on the value of $b$. The answer is: -3b.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
