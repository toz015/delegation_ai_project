To find out in how many three-day periods Suzanne has to walk eight miles to reach the fewest possible total number of miles she can walk in February, we need to first find out how many miles Suzanne has walked in one month (February has approximately 31 days). Each time Suzanne walks four miles, she walks a total of $\\frac{4}{3}\\approx 1.33$ miles in one day. So, in a whole month, she walks approximately $1.33\\times31\\approx 41.33$ miles. If she wants to have as few miles left over as possible after walking eight miles every three days, she needs to complete exactly one full cycle of walking eight miles three times plus some remainder miles. She cannot complete exactly two cycles because that would require walking a total of $16+16=32$ miles in two cycles, which is less than the total of approximately 41.33 miles she needs to walk in a whole month. Since each cycle takes three days, she completes her last cycle on the $(3\\times 2)+3=9$th day of February.
