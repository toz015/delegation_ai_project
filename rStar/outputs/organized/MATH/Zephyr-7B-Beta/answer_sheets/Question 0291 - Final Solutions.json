The length of the rectangle's sides is $10$ (found by taking the absolute value of the difference between the corresponding x or y coordinates of the vertices). Using the formula for the area of a rectangle ($Area=Length\\times Width$), we know that the width is also $10$. This means that there are $\\boxed{100}$ square units in the rectangular region. Each square unit contains exactly one point with integer coordinates, except for the vertices and boundary points. However, we subtracted those points when finding the interior points, so we need to add them back in. By looking at the vertices, we see that there are $\\boxed{4}$ such points in total. Therefore, the total number of interior points with integer coordinates is $100+\\boxed{4}=\\boxed{104}$. The answer is: 104.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
