Condition 1:  A wheel with the numbers 1,2,3,4,6,9 evenly distributed around its circumference is spun twice. Condition 2: The numbers indicated by the pointer on the second spin determine the row and column of a checkerboard (see diagram), with each remainder being equally likely. Condition 3: A checker is placed on the intersection of the column and row determined by these spins.

Since the wheel is spun twice, each number appears twice in the row and column selections. Also, since there are no odd numbers on the wheel, each remainder is equally likely to determine the row or column. This means that each square on the checkerboard has an equal probability of having a checker placed on it. So, the number of shaded squares on the checkerboard is the same as the number of squares on the checkerboard, which is $\\boxed{36}$. The answer is: 36.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78536344/127013946-dcd4a62a-c1e9-4bcb-bbf3-5ba3b99f07b2.png)", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard?", "subanswer": {"text": "As explained above, each square has an equal probability of having a checker placed on it.
