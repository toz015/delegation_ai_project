The circle lying outside $S$ has its center at a vertex of the nonagon. Its radius is the distance from the center of the circumcircle to the farthest point of $S$. This distance is equal to half the diameter of the circle. The diameter is twice the radius. First, let's find the radius of the circle lying outside $S$. As we have found the radius of the circle that lies inside $S$, we know that they are both equal. Let's call the radius of both circles $r$. In order to find the radius of the circle lying outside $S$, we need to calculate the distance between the vertices and the edge of the nonagon. We can draw a triangle that has one vertex on the circle lying inside $S$, another vertex on the edge of the nonagon and the third vertex is the farthest point from the edge, where it touches the circle lying outside $S$. This distance is also half the diameter of the circle lying outside $S$. By Pythagoras Theorem, we find that the height of the triangle is $h=\\frac{s}{\\sin(20^\\circ)}$, where $s$ is the length of one side of the nonagon. The base of the triangle is the distance between the vertex of the nonagon and the edge, which is $r$. Thus, the altitude of the triangle is $h=\\frac{2}{\\sin(20^\\circ)}=4.2$. The length of the base is $r$. Finally, we find that the distance from the vertex of the nonagon to the edge is $\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}$.

The perimeter of $S$ is the sum of the perimeter of the regular nonagon and the perimeter of the circle lying inside $S$. To calculate the perimeter of the circle lying inside $S$, we use the fact that the circumference of any circle is $2\\pi r$. To calculate the perimeter of the regular nonagon, we need to find the number of sides and the length of each side. Since we assume that the nonagon is regular, we use the same method as before.
