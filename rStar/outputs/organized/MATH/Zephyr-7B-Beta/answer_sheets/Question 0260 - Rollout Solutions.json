We first need to find these distances. Using the distance formula in three dimensions, we get:\n\n$|AC|^2 = (x_c-x_a)^2 + (y_c-y_a)^2 + (z_c-z_a)^2$\n\nSimilarly, for $|AB|$:\n\n$|AB|^2 = (x_b-x_a)^2 + (", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Let $A = (1,-11,2),$ $B = (3,-4,1),$ and $C = (-2,1,-1).$  Compute $\\angle ABC,$ in degrees.", "ost_step": {"1": "To compute the angle between three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, we first find the vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AC}$."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
