Based on Hint 3, the area of one small square is $1$ square unit. To find the total area of the shaded region, we need to count how many small squares are included in the shaded region and multiply that number by the area of one small square. From the diagram, it seems like there are $12$ small squares included in the shaded region. Multiplying that by the area of one small square ($1$ square unit), we get a total area of $12$ square units for the shaded region.
