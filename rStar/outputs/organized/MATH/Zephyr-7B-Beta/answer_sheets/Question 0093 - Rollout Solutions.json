Here, we have $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$. Comparing the forms, we see that $a=0$ and $b=-6$. Substituting back, the radius is $r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-6)^2} = |-6| = 6$. Now, let's calculate $c$ using the quadratic formula: $c = -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}/2a$. Note that here $a=0$. Using the substitution $y = -\\dfrac{10}{6}x + \\dfrac{c}{6}$, we can transform the equation into the standard form $x^2+\\left(\\frac{10}{6}x+\\frac{c}{6}\\right)^2=\\frac{c^2}{36", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
