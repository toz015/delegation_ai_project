Now, we can write the second and third terms using the formula: Second term = First term + Common difference\nThird term = First term + 2 * Common difference\nSo, $15=7+d$ and $23=7+2d$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives us $18=d$. So, the common difference $d$ in this arithmetic sequence is $\\boxed{18}$. The answer is: 18.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Now that we have found the common difference, let's use it to calculate the middle term of the given sequence: $3^2, x, 3^4$. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a+(n-1)d$. If the nth term is the middle term, then n = (number of terms)/2 + 1 (because the sequence starts from the first term). Now, let's put the values in the above mentioned formula: $x = 3^2 + ((number of terms)/2 - 0.5) * d$. Here, the sequence consists of three terms ($3^2$, x, and $3^4$). Hence, the number of terms is 3. Using this information, the formula becomes: $x = 9 + ((3)/2 - 0.5) * 18$. Simplifying this expression, we get: $x = 3 * (3 * 3 - 1) = \\boxed{81}$. The answer is: 81.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
