Now, equate coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and constants: $b^2=3.6$. Subtracting $b^2$ from both sides of the equation, we get: $x^2+2bx=(2.6)x+3.6-b^2$. To make the coefficient of $x$ zero, set $2b=-2.6$. Solving for $b$, we get $b=1.3$. Substituting $b$ into the equation for $b^2$, we get $b^2=1.764$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $3.6-1.764=\\boxed{1.836}$.
