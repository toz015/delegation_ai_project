This means that the sum of all the proper divisors of $S$ includes the proper divisors of each of the integers in $S$. For example, if $S$ were $12$, then we would include the proper divisors of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Now consider the case where $S$ is $284$. Then the sum of all the proper divisors of $S$ would include not only the proper divisors of each of the integers in $S$ but also the proper divisors of their sum, which is $S$ itself. Since $S$ appears twice, once as its own proper divisor and once as part of the sum of its proper divisors, we need to subtract $S$ itself from our total sum. So the actual sum of all the proper divisors of $S$ is $S$ minus $S$, which is zero.
