Since $x^4$ is divisible by 4, the coefficient 1 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Each $x^3$ is also divisible by 4, so the coefficient 5 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Each $x^2$ is divisible by 4, so the coefficient 9 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. The $x$ term is not divisible by 4, but since it appears inside the exponent, it still contributes a remainder of 0 when dividided by 4.
