The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

We'll call the smaller number $a$ and the larger number $b$, so that $a \\leq b$. Then the difference between the larger and smaller number is $d = b - a$. Now, let's apply this to our problem.
