We need to find the equation of the line that passes through the midpoint of the segment joining $(4,1)$ and $(5,0)$, and is perpendicular to the line passing through these points. The midpoint of $(4,1)$ and $(5,0)$ is $(\\frac{4+5}{2},\\frac{1+0}{2})=(4.5,0.5)$. To find the slope of the perpendicular bisector, we first find the slope of the line joining $(4,1)$ and $(5,0)$. The slope of a line can be found by taking the difference in $y$-coordinates divided by the difference in $x$-coordinates: $m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Applying this formula to our line yields: $m=\\frac{0-1}{5-4}=-\\frac{1}{5}$. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the original slope. So, the slope of our perpendicular bisector is: $m=-\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot (-5) = 1$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To summarize, our midpoint is $(4.5,0.5)$ and our slope is 1. Using point-slope form, we can write the equation of our perpendicular bisector as: $y-0.5=1(x-4.5)$. Simplifying, we get: $y=x-1$. Now, let's see how we can use this equation to obtain the ordered quadruple $(a,b,c,d)$. The point $(4,1)$ is reflected over the perpendicular bisector. After reflection, the new $y$-value is $-(x-4.5)$. Substituting $(4,1)$ into the equation of the perpendicular bisector, we get: $-(x-4.5)=x-1$. Simplifying, we get: $x=-(y-1)+5$. Next, we can determine the quadratic part of the image equation. Notice that the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ all involve $y$. Since the origin is fixed under the transformation, we know that $(0,0)$ remains fixed. Thus, we know that $x$ and $y$ terms in", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
