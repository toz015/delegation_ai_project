We want to find the number of boxes that contain only pens. To do this, we need to count the number of boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils and subtract it from the total number of boxes. Since each box contains either pens or pencils, we cannot have a box containing just pencils and no pens, or vice versa. However, we could have a box containing neither pens nor pencils, since some boxes contain only pens and others contain only pencils. Let's call the number of such boxes $x$. The number of boxes containing only pens is then $4-x$. To calculate the value of $x$, we use the fact that the total number of boxes is $10$. Of those $10$ boxes, $2$ contain both pens and pencils, leaving $8$ boxes containing either pens or pencils, but not both. Out of those $8$ boxes, let's say that $x$ of them contain neither pens nor pencils. Therefore, the other $8-x$ of those boxes contain both pens and pencils.

Again, we're trying to find the number of boxes containing only pencils. Let's call that number $y$. The number of boxes containing only pencils is then $5-y$. Since every box must contain either pens or pencils (or both), we cannot have a box containing only pencils unless we already have a box containing only pens. Therefore, if the number of boxes containing only pens is $4-x$, then we should have $5-y$ fewer boxes containing only pencils because there are now fewer boxes to contain pencils. That means that $y+x=5$. But we already found that $x+4-x=8$, so we have another equation relating $x$ and $y$. Now we can solve the system using Gaussian elimination. First we add $-x$ to both sides of the first equation, giving us $y=5-x$. Then we subtract $y$ from both sides of the second equation, giving us $x=3-y$. So our final system is $y=5-x$ and $x=3-y$. Using the second equation to substitute $x$ into the first equation, we obtain $y=5-(3-y)=8-y$. This says that the sum of $x$ and $y$ is fixed ($10$), but we can move pencils from one box to another, effectively changing $x$ and $y$. For example, if we take a pen out of one of the boxes that initially contained only pens, and put it in a box that initially contained only pencils, we have decreased $x$ by $1$ and increased $y$ by $1$. On the other hand, if we took a pencil out of one of the boxes that initially contained both pens and pencils, and put it in a box that initially contained only pencils, we would leave $x$ unchanged and decrease $y$ by $1$. In other words, taking a pen out of a box containing only pens is equivalent to taking a pencil out of a box containing both pens and pencils.

This tells us that the difference between the number of boxes containing only pens and the number of boxes containing only pencils is a constant ($8$). This implies that the number of boxes containing neither pens nor pencils is $x+y$ (since we have already accounted for the boxes containing only pens or only pencils).
