To find the coordinates of point M, we need to find the midpoint of side QR. The coordinates of Q are ($0$,$34$), and the coordinates of R are ($34$,$32$). The midpoint of QR is $\\left(\\dfrac{0+34}{2},\\dfrac{34+32}{2}\\right)=\\left(17,\\dfrac{66}{2}\\right)\\approx\\left(17,33\\right)$. Now we know that median $\\overline{QM}$ meets side PR at point M, which lies on the line segment joining P and R. Let's assume M is located at ($x,y)$, and draw perpendicular bisectors for both QP and QR. These bisectors intersect at M. The equation of the perpendicular bisector of QP is $y = -\\dfrac{34}{32}(x - 0) + 34$. And the equation of the perpendicular bisector of QR is $y = -\\dfrac{34}{34}(x - 34) + 34$.

Question: What is the relationship between the medians of these two triangles? Let's think step by step. From the first condition, we know that median $\\overline{QM}$ meets side PR at point M, whose coordinates are approximately $(17,33)$. Let's call the midpoint of side ST as N. Since all medians of any triangle meet at the same point called centroid G, we can say that the median drawn from N towards R is concurrent with the median drawn from M towards R. This is because all medians of any triangle meet at the same point called centroid G, and G is located on the medians drawn from each vertex of the triangle to the midpoints of the opposite sides. To find the coordinates of N, we need to find the midpoint of side ST. The coordinates of S are ($x_1$,$y_1$) and the coordinates of T are ($x_2$,$y_2$). The midpoint of ST is $\\left(\\dfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\dfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
