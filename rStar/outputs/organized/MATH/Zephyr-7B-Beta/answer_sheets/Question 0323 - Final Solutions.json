From the law of cosines, this occurs when the angle between the arcs $AB$ and $AC$ is less than the sum of the angles between the other arcs. Using symmetry again, this is equivalent to requiring that the smaller of the two angles between $AB$ and $AC$ is less than the sum of the other two angles. Therefore, we have $|AB|<|AC|+|BD|$.
