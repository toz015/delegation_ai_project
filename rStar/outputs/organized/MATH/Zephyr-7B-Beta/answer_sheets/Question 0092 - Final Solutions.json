Now, let's find the probability that exactly four of the islands have treasure. Let $q$ be the probability that exactly three of the islands have treasure. Then, since the probability of finding treasure on any single island is $p$ and the probability of not finding treasure on any single island is $(1-p)$, the probability of not finding treasure on exactly $k$ out of $n$ independent trials is ${n \\choose k}(1-p)^k p^{n-k}$. Using our previous calculations, we know that the probability of finding treasure on exactly three of the seven islands is $q = {7 \\choose 3}(1-p)^3 p^4$. Therefore, the probability of finding treasure on exactly four of the seven islands is ${7 \\choose 4}(1-p)^4 p^3$. Note that the product of the probabilities of finding treasure on exactly three and exactly four islands is equal to the probability of finding treasure on exactly three or four islands, since exactly three or four islands includes either finding treasure on exactly three islands or finding treasure on exactly four islands, but not both.
