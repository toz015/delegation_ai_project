Both denominators in the first term and both denominators in the second term contain a quadratic equation that is not factored. So, we cannot easily determine the possible rational roots. However, for the third term, notice that both denominators contain the same quadratic equation $x^2-(m+6)x-36$, where $m$ is the leading coefficient of the quadratic equation in the denominator of the second term. This means that, if any real root exists, it must also be a root of the quadratic equation in the denominator of the third term. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $d = (-m-6)^2-4(-1)(-36)\\approx 63744$. Since $d>0$, there are no real roots. Therefore, there are no real roots in this equation. The answer is: None.
