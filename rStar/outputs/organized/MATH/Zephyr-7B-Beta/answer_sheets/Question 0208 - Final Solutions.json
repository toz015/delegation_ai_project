An integer is divisible by three if its last digit is either zero, three, or six. Thus, there are three possible last digits that satisfy divisibility by three.

Now, let's see how many integers satisfy all three divisibility conditions simultaneously. First, note that any multiple of fifteen (which is the product of three, four, and five) automatically satisfies all three divisibility conditions. However, not every multiple of fifteen is within the range of the first hundred positive integers. So, we need to count both cases separately. Secondly, there are no other numbers that satisfy all three divisibility conditions, because if any two conditions are satisfied, the third condition cannot be met since three, four, and five do not share a common multiple.
