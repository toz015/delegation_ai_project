First, we draw a picture of the rectangular field. Draw one side as the length and the other as the width. Make sure to mark the corner where Jim and Martha start. Draw Jim's diagonal path and Martha's path along the length and width. Connect the ends of both paths to show that they meet at the same spot. Now let's calculate the distances Jim and Martha travel. Jim travels along his diagonal path, so we use the distance formula for a slanted line to find the length: $d=\\sqrt{length^2+width^2}$. Martha travels horizontally for the width and vertically for the length. Her distance is: horizontal distance + vertical distance = width + length. Subtracting Jim's distance from Martha's distance gives us how much farther she walked: $width + length - d = Feet$. So, the formula becomes: $300+400-\\sqrt{300^2+400^2} = Feet$. Simplifying: $Feet = 700 - \\sqrt{1200000}$. Therefore, Martha walks $\\boxed{700 - \\sqrt", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
