Therefore, the product $3m + 4n$ is a multiple of both 9 and 12, hence a multiple of lcm(9, 12) = 36."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Since $3m + 4n$ is a multiple of 36, we can write it as $36q$, where $q$ is some integer. Substituting this into the original equation, we get: $3m + 4n = 36q \\Longleftrightarrow m = 12q - \\dfrac{4}{3}n$. We can see that if $m$ is smaller than $n$, then $q$ would be negative, leading to larger absolute difference between $m$ and $n$. On the other hand, if $m$ is greater than $n$, then $q$ would be positive, leading to the same absolute difference between $m$ and $n$. Therefore, the minimum value of $|m-n|$ occurs when $m$ is equal to $n$. In other words, the smallest possible value of $|m-n|$ is $\\boxed{|m-n|=|0|=0}$. The answer is: 0.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
