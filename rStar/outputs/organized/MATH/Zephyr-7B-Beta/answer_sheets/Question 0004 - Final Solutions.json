Based on the hints, the student who finished at point $(8,0)$ ran the furthest distance. However, we cannot determine who had the greatest average speed based solely on distance. To find the student with the greatest average speed, we need to calculate each student's average speed. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance covered by the total time taken. From the graph, we see that Evelyn ran a distance of approximately 4 units in approximately 1 unit of time, Carla ran a distance of approximately 5 units in approximately 1 unit of time, Briana ran a distance of approximately 2 units in approximately 1 unit of time, Debra ran a distance of approximately 3 units in approximately 1 unit of time, and Angela ran a distance of approximately 2 units in approximately 1 unit of time. Using these measurements, we can calculate the average speeds of each student:\n\n- Evelyn: $4\\text{ units}/1\\text{ unit}=4\\text{ m}/\\text{s}$\n- Carla: $5\\text{ units}/1\\text{ unit}=5\\text{ m}/\\text", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The results of a cross-country team's training run are graphed below.
