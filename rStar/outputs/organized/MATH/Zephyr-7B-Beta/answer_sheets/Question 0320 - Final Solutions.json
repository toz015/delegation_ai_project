Since the total area of the original square was also $s^2$, the areas of both the original square and the $16$ smaller squares added together are equal, which makes sense since they fill up the entire diagram.\n\nCondition 3: If the length of one side of the square is $x$, how many smaller squares fit exactly within the larger square? Since each smaller square has side length $\\frac{x}{2}$, the width of the row of smaller squares is $\\frac{x}{2}$. There are $8$ rows in total because there are $8$ vertical rows of smaller squares, each containing $2$ smaller squares, plus the top and bottom rows which contain only $1$ smaller square", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 10}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
