So, we can select any three types of cookies from this minimum requirement. There are $\\boxed{20}$ ways to do this since we can choose three out of the three possible types. Alternatively, we can select three out of the twelve cookies available. These three selected cookies could be all the same type or could include one or more from each type. Thus, there are $\\boxed{220}$ ways to do this. Step 6: However, we also need to take into account the fact that we cannot distinguish between multiple cookies of the same type. For example, if Pat selects three chocolate chip cookies, then the selection is not distinguishable from another selection of three chocolate chip cookies. So, we need to divide our result by the number of indistinguishable selections of each type: $20/2^3=5$. Therefore, the number of distinguishable selections of six cookies from the tray is $\\boxed{120/5=24}$.
