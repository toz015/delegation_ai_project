Two circles can intersect each other in several ways: they may touch, cross twice, or not intersect at all.

Therefore, when we fix one circle, the second circle can take an infinite number of positions in the plane. For each position, there are finitely many possible intersections, and hence there are at most a countable infinity of points of intersection of the two circles. If we consider two different circles, the same reasoning applies. Hence, the maximum number of points that two circles can share is countably infinite.
