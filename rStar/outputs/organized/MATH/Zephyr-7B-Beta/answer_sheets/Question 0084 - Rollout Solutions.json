Let's take another look at the given expression for the product. We observe that the term involving $t^4$ is $12t^4$. The leading coefficient of the term in $t^4$ is $12$, whereas the leading coefficients of the terms in $t^3$, $t^2$, $t$, and constants are missing.

To find $a+b$, we compare the coefficients of $t^4$ in the original expression and the expression inside the parentheses. We know that $a=12$. The coefficient of $t^4$ inside the parentheses is also $12$. Therefore, $b$ is equal to $12$, so $\\boxed{a+b=12}$. The answer is: 12.\n\nAlternative solution:", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
