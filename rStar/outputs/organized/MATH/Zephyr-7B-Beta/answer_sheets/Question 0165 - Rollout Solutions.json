After taking two books off each shelf, the new number of books on each shelf is:\n- Top shelf: $8-2=6$ mystery books\n- Middle shelf: $10-2=8$ math books\n- Bottom shelf: $6-2=4$ science books\n\nTo find the total number of books remaining, add up the number of books on each shelf: $6 + 8 + 4 = 18$. Now, to find what fraction of the books remaining are math books, we divide the number of math books by the total number of books remaining: $\\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{2}{6}$. To convert it into a common fraction, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3: $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{6}{18} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The answer is: 1/3.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
