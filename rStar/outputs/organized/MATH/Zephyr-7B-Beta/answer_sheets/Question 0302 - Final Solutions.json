The answer is $\\overline{0.272727}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. To find how many digits repeat, we need to analyze the decimal. Since the decimal becomes repeating, we write it as a fraction with a vinculum above it, i.e., as $\\overline{0.272727}$. Now, let's look closely at the repeating part: $0.27\\overline{27}$. Notice that there are three digits repeating. Hence, the number of digits repeating is $\\boxed{3}$. The answer is: 3.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
