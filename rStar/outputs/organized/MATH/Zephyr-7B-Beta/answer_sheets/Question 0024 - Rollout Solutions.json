According to condition 2, the person deposits their entire annual wage ($20,000$) into the savings account at the end of each year. After making three deposits, the total amount in their savings account is $3A$. Since the deposits earn interest over time, we cannot simply add up the amounts deposited to find the total amount in the account. Instead, we need to take into account the interest earned over multiple years. Let's use algebra to calculate the interest earned over the course of three years. After making their first deposit, the person earns simple interest on that deposit for two years (until the end of their second year). The formula for simple interest is $I=prt$, where $p$ is the principal (the initial amount invested), $r$ is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and $t$ is the number of years the investment is held. In our case, the principal is $20,000$, the interest rate is $r$, and the time is two years. So we have $I_1=20,000r2$. Next, after making their second deposit, the person earns compound interest on the total balance (which includes the principle and any accumulated interest) for one year. The formula for compound interest is $FV=PV(1+r)^n$, where $FV$ is the future value (the final amount owed or received), $PV$ is the present value (the initial amount invested), $r$ is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), and $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year. In our case, the principal is $3A$, the interest rate is $r$, and the number of compounding periods per year is 1 (since compounding occurs annually). So we have $FV_1=3A(1+r)=3A+3Ar$. We're interested in finding the value of $r$. Notice that we've already calculated the simple interest earned during the first two years, but we haven't factored in the compound interest earned during the final year. That's why we added $3Ar$ instead of just $3A$ to $FV_1$. After making their third deposit, the person again earns compound interest for one year.
