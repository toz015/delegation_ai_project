Since $x$ appears on both sides of the equation, we need to isolate it on one side. Let's first square both sides: $x^2=11-2x+16x-32x^2$. Now, let's collect terms involving $x^2$: $x^2=-32x^2+11-16x$. To solve for $x$, we set the coefficient of $x^2$ equal to zero: $-32x^2=0$. This means that either $x=0$ or $x^2=0$.
