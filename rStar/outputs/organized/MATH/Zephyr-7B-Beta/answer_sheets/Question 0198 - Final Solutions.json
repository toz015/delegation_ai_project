So, we need to divide the number of arrangements when the positions of the boys are fixed by 2. Therefore, there are $\\dfrac{6!\\cdot 2!}{2}=360$ possible arrangements for them to sit in a row with the condition that the 2 boys want to sit next to each other.

Since the positions of the boys are fixed, we can arrange the 6 girls around them. There are 8 seats altogether, so we can arrange the 6 girls among those 8 seats using combinations. We choose 6 objects from a group of 8 objects, which gives us $\\binom{8}{6} = 28$ arrangements.

Since they want to sit next to each other, we can swap their positions without changing the arrangement of the other students. This means that there are actually only 2 ways to arrange the boys: one where they're sitting side by side, and another where they're swapped. With our previous calculation of 28 arrangements when their positions are fixed, this makes a total of $2\\cdot28=\\boxed{56}$ arrangements possible. The answer is: 56.\n\nHint 2: Use symmetry to reduce the number of arrangements. If you look closely at the symmetrical positions of the students, you will notice that some of them are equivalent. For example, if we exchange the leftmost boy with the rightmost girl, the arrangement is still the same as long as the position of the boys remains unchanged. Based on this observation, we can further reduce the number of arrangements. Let's think step by step. When we exchange the leftmost boy with the rightmost girl, it's like rotating the entire row by 180 degrees. However, since the positions of the boys are fixed, the rotation doesn't", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
