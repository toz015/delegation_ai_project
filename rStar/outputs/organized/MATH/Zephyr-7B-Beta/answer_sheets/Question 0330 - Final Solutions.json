Therefore, the number of ways to select a subcommittee of size 5 with exactly three Democrats is ${6}\\choose{3}{8}\\choose{2}=288$. Summing up the cases above, we get the total number of ways to select a subcommittee of size 5 containing at least one member from each political party: $96+288=384$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{384}$ ways to make this selection.
