We want to combine terms in such a way that the product of their coefficients is minimized while keeping their sum equal to the corresponding term in the initial expression. Let's start with $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Multiplying their coefficients gives us $a=1$. Now, let's try combining them by adding their coefficients: $1+\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Simplifying, we get $1+\\sqrt{2}$. We don't want the square root in the coefficient since it's not an integer. To eliminate it, we'll multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$. This leads to $1+\\sqrt{2} = \\dfrac{1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}+1\\cdot\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\dfrac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Combining this new term with $\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$, we get:\n\n$$\\dfrac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c} = \\dfrac{\\left(\\dfrac{2", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If we write $\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ in the form $\\dfrac{a\\sqrt{2} + b\\sqrt{3}}{c}$ such that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $c$ is as small as possible, then what is $a+b+c$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Is $\\sqrt{2}$ equal to $\\sqrt{3}$?", "subanswer": {"text": "No, since $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142$ and $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$, $\\sqrt{2}$ is less than $\\sqrt{3}$.
