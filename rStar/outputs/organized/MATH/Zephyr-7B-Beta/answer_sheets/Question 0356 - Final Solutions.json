The same logic applies to the second inequality, since we want $4-\\sqrt{176}$ to be greater than or equal to $0$. This would mean that $x^2$ is less than or equal to $0$, but we also know that $x^2$ is greater than or equal to $-5.25$. These solutions contradict the initial inequality as well. The answer is: There are no possible values for $x^2$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Based on the hints, there aren't any real values of $x$ that satisfy the given inequality. This is because when we solve for $x^2$, we get values outside the range of possible values for $x^2$. The answer is: No real values of $x$ satisfy the given inequality. The answer is: $\\emptyset$.\n\nI hope you found these explanations helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}]
