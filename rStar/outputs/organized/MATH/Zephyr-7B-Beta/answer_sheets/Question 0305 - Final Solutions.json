When we square both sides of an equation, we keep the equality intact because any side of an equation can be multiplied by a positive real number without changing the value of the side. Therefore, when we square both sides, we ensure that the equation remains valid and we create more opportunities to simplify expressions. For example, in this case, squaring both sides allows us to remove the square root symbols, making it easier to isolate $x$.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 6}]
