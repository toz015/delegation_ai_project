Since $x$ lies between $0^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$, we have $0^\\circ < x^\\circ < 180^\\circ$. To convert $x^\\circ$ to radians, we use the conversion formula $x^\\circ = \\dfrac{\\pi x}{180}$ radians. This leads to: $0 < \\dfrac{\\pi x}{180} < \\pi$ radians. Now, let's calculate the value of $\\sqrt{\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi x}{180})}$. Since $\\sin(\\dfrac{\\pi x}{180})$ is a non-negative number between $0$ and $1$, we can take its square root without any restrictions.
