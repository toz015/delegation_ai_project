Condition 1:  There are $N$ students, where $N<50$, on a field trip. Condition 2: When their teacher forms groups of eight, the final group has five students remaining. Condition 3: When their teacher forms groups of six, the final group has three students remaining. Question: What is the total sum of all possible values of $N$?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We can represent the situation using variables. Let $a$ be the number of groups with 8 students each and let $b$ be the number of groups with 6 students each. First, since $N$ is less than 50, $N$ cannot form more than 8 groups of 8 students each, so $a\\leq 50/8=6.25$. Second, since the final group has 5 students left, there are $5=(a+b)\\bmod 8=a\\bmod 8+b\\bmod 8$ students left when all groups finish, and it turns out that $N-(a*8+b*6)=5$ also holds. Thus, $N=(a*8+b*6)+5$. Using the condition that $N<50$, we can get a system of linear inequalities:\n\n$a\\leq 6$   \n$b\\geq 0$    \n$(a*8+b*6)\\leq 50-5$  \n\nFrom the first inequality, it is clear that we don't need to consider negative values of $b$,", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A group of $N$ students, where $N < 50$, is on a field trip.
