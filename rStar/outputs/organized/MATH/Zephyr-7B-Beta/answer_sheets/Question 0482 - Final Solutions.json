First, we need to determine $|S|$, the number of terminating decimal values for the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010. There are two cases:\n\nCase 1: The odd integer has a factor of 2. For example, 1998 could be written as $999\\cdot2$. In this case, the denominator of the fraction has a factor of 2 as well, leading to an infinite decimal expansion. Therefore, the reciprocal does not have a finite decimal representation. Case 2: The odd integer does not have a factor of 2. For example, 1315 could be written as $657\\cdot2^3$. To determine whether the corresponding decimal representation is terminating, we need to look at how many times 2 appears as a factor. If it appears an even number of times, the decimal representation is repeating and hence not terminating; otherwise, it is terminating.
