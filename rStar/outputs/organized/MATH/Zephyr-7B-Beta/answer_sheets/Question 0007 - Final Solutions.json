Let's call the point on the first line $(a,b,-c)$, and the point on the second line $(d,e,-f)$. From condition 1, we know that each pair of variables satisfies a multiple ratio. For example, $2x = 3y$, so $x = \\dfrac{3}{2}y$. Similarly, we get $x = -\\dfrac{1}{2}z$ from $2x = -z$. Plugging these expressions into the second equation in condition 1 ($z = -y/2$) gives us $-\\dfrac{1}{2}(-y/2) = x$. Now, let's find some points on each line. Point $(a,b,-c)$ on the first line can be found by solving the system of equations:\n\n\\begin{cases}\n2a = 3b \\\\\n-a = b\n\\end{cases}\n\nThis system has no solution because the equations are not compatible.

From Hint 1, we know that $z$ is proportional to both $x$ and $y$. By setting $z$ equal to a common value, we can eliminate $z$ from both equations, leaving us with equations for $x$ and $y$. Let's try $z=1$. With this substitution, the first equation becomes $2x=3y$, and the second equation becomes $6x=-y$. Now, let's calculate the slopes. Using slope form for the first line, we have $(1,0,1) \\rightarrow (0,1,0)$ as a direction vector for the modified first line. Its slope is $m'_1 = \\dfrac{0-1}{1-0} = -1$.
