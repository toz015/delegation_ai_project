The answer is: 3x.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Using the hint, let's think step by step. We want to find the value of $6x + 5$. We can start by finding the value of $3x$. Since $x$ appears inside parentheses in the second term, we need to distribute the coefficient $2$ to both terms inside the parentheses: $2(1 + x) = 2 + 2x$. Now, substitute this expression for $2(1 + x)$ into the original equation: $3x + 2(1 + x) = 17$. Combining like terms, we get $3x + 2 + 2x = 17$. Grouping the terms involving $x$, we get $(3 + 2)x + 2 = 17$. Now, we can solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{15}{5} = \\boxed{3}$. Using the value of $x$, we can now find the value of $6x + 5$: $6(3) + 5 = 18$. Therefore, the value of $6x + 5$ is $\\boxed{18}$. The answer is: 18.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 10}]
