By condition 1, we know that the quadratic equation has the form $x^2 + x + b = 0$. By condition 2, let's say that whenever $c$ is a root of the equation, then $c^2 - 2$ is also a root of the equation. This happens when $(c^2 - 2)/(-1)$ is also a root of the equation. Therefore, equating these two roots, we get $c^2 - 2 = (c^2 - 2)/(-1)$, which gives us $a = 1$. The quadratic equation that satisfies both conditions is $x^2 + x + b = 0$, where $a=1$. Therefore, any such quadratic equation is uniquely determined by the value of $b$. Conversely, given any value of $b$, we can construct a unique quadratic equation satisfying both conditions. Hence, infinitely many quadratic equations satisfy both conditions. The answer is: Infinitely many.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
