There are several ways to approach this problem.

Let's calculate them separately.\n\nFirst, let's find the number of positive factors of $10!$. By definition, a positive integer $d$ is a factor of $10!$ if and only if $10!$ is divisible by $d$. But, we already know that $x$ is a positive factor of $10!$. That means $10!$ is divisible by $x$. Now, since each integer $d$ that divides both $10!$ and $x$ is a factor of $x$ and a factor of $10!/x$, the number of positive factors of $10!$ is equal to the product of the number of positive factors of $x$ and the number of positive factors of $10!/x$.

Applying this method to $10!$, we see that it has $4$ digits, so it contributes $4$. It also contains primes $2$ and $5$, both appearing $5$ times.

So, the possible integer values that $x$ takes are the positive factors of $10!$. Now, let's look at the condition more carefully. $10!$ contains many zeroes. The last digit of $10!$ is a zero, and there are nine trailing zeroes. Therefore, some of the factors of $10!$ are multiples of $10$. For example, $5$ and $2$ appear five times each in $10!$, so $25=5\\cdot5$ and $20=2\\cdot10$ are factors of $10!$.
