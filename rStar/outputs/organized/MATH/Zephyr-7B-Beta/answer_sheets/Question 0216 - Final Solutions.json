To convert drinkets to trinkets using Condition 1, we need to convert drinkets to blinkets first. So, we divide the number of drinkets by 3 to get the number of blinkets. For example, to convert 56 drinkets, we divide it by 3: $56 \\div 3 = 18$. Next, we use Condition 1 to convert 18 blinkets to trinkets: $18 = 4 * \\text{number of trinkets}$, so $\\text{number of trinkets} = 18 \\div 4 = \\boxed{4.5}$ (since we can't have decimal trinkets, we round up to nearest integer).
