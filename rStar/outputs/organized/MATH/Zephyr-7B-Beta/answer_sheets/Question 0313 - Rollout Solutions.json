During one revolution, the wheel moves a distance equal to the circumference of the wheel. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C=2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

We then multiply this by 2 revolutions to get the total distance covered in 3 seconds. The calculation is as follows: First, let's convert seconds to radians: $180^\\circ = \\pi$ radians.
