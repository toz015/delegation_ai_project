We know that the sum of the interior angles of any polygon is equal to $(n-2)180^{\\circ}$. This is because each interior angle is supplementary to the exterior angles formed by extending the sides of the polygon outside, and the exterior angles themselves form a straight line (which is $180^{\\circ}$). In our problem, we know that the sum of $(n-1)$ interior angles is $1070^{\\circ}$. So, we have $(n-1)180=1070$, or $n-1=\\dfrac{1070}{180}$, or $n=1070\\div180+1=\\boxed{6}$.
