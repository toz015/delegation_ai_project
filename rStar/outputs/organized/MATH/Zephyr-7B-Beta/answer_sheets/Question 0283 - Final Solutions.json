First, let's simplify the expressions inside the parentheses: $\\left(4\\dfrac{5}{8}\\right)^{55} = \\left(1+\\dfrac{5}{8}\\right)^{55} \\approx 319.406$. Second, let's find out how many times we need to raise $1+\\dfrac{5}{8}$ to get $319.406$: $\\left(1+\\dfrac{5}{8}\\right)^{55} \\approx 319.406 \\Rightarrow 55 = \\log_{1+\\dfrac{5}{8}}\\left(319.406\\right) \\approx 12.41$. Therefore, the same exponentiation applies to both expressions: $\\left(\\dfrac{8}{37}\\right)^{55} \\approx 3.194 \\cdot 10^{-41}$.

This decimal is approximately $5.78125$. Now, let's raise it to the power of 55: $5.78125^{55}$. As for the second term, the decimal equivalent of $\\dfrac{8}{37}$ is approximately $0.216$. So, now we have: $5.78125^{55} * 0.216^{55}$. Simplifying the exponents, we get: $(5.78125)^55 * (0.216)^55$. Using a calculator, we find that the product is approximately $23.5897$.
