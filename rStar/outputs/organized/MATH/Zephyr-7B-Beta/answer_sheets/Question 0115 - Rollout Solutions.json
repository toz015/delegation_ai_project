An arrangement is determined by placing each L in one of the seven spaces between them. There are $\\boxed{7!}$ ways to do this since the order matters. However, we need to subtract out the number of cases where two or more L's line up vertically because those arrangements would not look different. To do this, we first consider that we don't care about the vertical position of the leftmost L since it determines the vertical positions of all other L's. This means we can choose any one of the seven spaces for the leftmost L, giving us $\\boxed{7}$ options. Now, we want to fill in the spaces between the leftmost L and the rightmost L with the remaining six L's without allowing two L's to line up vertically. For this, we can use the same reasoning as before, but now we have five spaces instead of seven. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{5!}$ ways to place the remaining L's.
