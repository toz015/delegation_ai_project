We can write the sum as $(1+1)\\times(6\\times10^4)$, since 12 adds up to 120, and 123 adds up to 1,230, and so on. Note that each pair parentheses represents an instance of adding 1 followed by adding a multiple of 120. Now, let's use the first condition: $1+12=13$, which is not congruent to 0 when divided by 9. However, for larger pairs, the sum modulo 9 gets closer to 0. For example, $123+1234=123+123=246$, which is congruent to 0 when divided by 9. Therefore, the last digit of $n$ would be 6, and hence, we can say that $n$ ends with the digit 6, leaving us with $9-6=3$ digits before it. But how many leading zeros does it have?
