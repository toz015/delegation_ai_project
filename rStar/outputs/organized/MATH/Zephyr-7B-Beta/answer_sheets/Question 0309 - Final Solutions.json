If the smallest integer in our set is $x$, then the next integer must be one more than $x$. This integer would be $x+1$. Now, the third integer would be one more than $x+1$, so it would be $x+2$. Continuing like this, the sum of our integers would be $x+x+1+x+2=5(x+1)$. Since $x+1$ is a positive integer, it must be greater than or equal to 1. To minimize our sum, we want to make $x+1$ as small as possible. The smallest possible value for $x+1$ is 1, making $x=0$.
