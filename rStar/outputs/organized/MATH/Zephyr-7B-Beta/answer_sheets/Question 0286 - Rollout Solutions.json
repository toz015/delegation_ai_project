However, we also need to make sure that both $a$ and $c$ are positive integers. So, for each $a$ that satisfies these conditions, there are finitely many possibilities for $c$.

First, let's figure out what $T$ is. This is asking us about sets of triples where the three side lengths form a valid triangle. We know that a triangle can be formed if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Let's call these sides $a$, $b$, and $c$. Here are some examples:\n\n- If $a = 3$, $b = 4$, and $c = 5$, we have a valid triangle because $a + b > c$ ($7 > 5$) and $b + c > a$ ($9 > 3$). - If $a = 5$, $b = 5$, and $c = 5$, we also have a valid triangle because all three sides are equal. - However, if $a = 7$, $b = 6$, and $c = 5$, we do not have a valid triangle because although $a + b > c$ ($13 > 5$), $b + c$ is less than $a$ ($11 < 13$).
