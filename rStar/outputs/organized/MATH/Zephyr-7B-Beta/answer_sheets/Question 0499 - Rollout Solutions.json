Since altitude $\\overline{BE}$ is perpendicular to side $\\overline{AC}$, we get $\\angle EAH = \\angle ACB = 132^\\circ$. Now, since $\\angle ABH$ is an exterior angle of $\\angle AHB$, it is supplementary to the interior angle. Therefore, $\\angle ABH + \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$. Substituting our previous angles, we have $132^\\circ - \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ$. Solving for $\\angle AHb$, we get $\\angle AHb = \\boxed{18^\\circ}$.
