For this problem, we need to find the conditions for having exactly one real solution for the logarithmic equation. One condition is that the arguments of both logarithms must be positive. That is, $kx > 0$ and $x+2 > 0$, since taking the logarithm of negative numbers results in complex values. Another condition is that the expressions inside the logarithms must not differ too much, or else the equation may have multiple solutions. That is, $kx \\approx x+2$. Using some logarithmic properties, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n$$kx=2\\log(x+2)\\Leftrightarrow k=\\frac{2\\log(x+2)}{\\log(kx)}=\\frac{2}{\\log(x+2)/(\\log(kx))}\\approx\\frac{2}{\\log(x+2)/(\\log(x+2)-\\log(x))}=2\\left(\\frac{x}{x+2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we need to check whether the above approximation produces exactly one real solution. If we solve it for $x$, we get:", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
