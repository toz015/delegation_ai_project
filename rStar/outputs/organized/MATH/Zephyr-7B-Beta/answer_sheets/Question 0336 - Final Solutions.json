Since the bases are different here, we need to use the rule of changing the base: $a^m = b^m$, then $a = b^q$, where $q = log_b(a)$ is the power that $b$ needs to be raised to become equal to $a$. Applying this rule, $13^5 = 3^5*13^5 = 243 * 13^5$ since $log_3(13) = 3$. Similarly, $13^{-3} = \\frac{1}{13^3}$. Now, using the distributive property, we get $\\frac{1}{13^3} * 13^5 = \\frac{1}{3^3} * 13^2 = 13^{-3} * 13^2 = 13^0 = 1$.
