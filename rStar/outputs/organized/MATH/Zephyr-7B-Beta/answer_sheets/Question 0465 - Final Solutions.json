The first few triangular numbers are $1, 3, 6, 10, ...$. The pattern is obvious. Each row has one more dot than the previous row, so the nth row has $n$ dots. So the nth triangular number is $T_n = 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2$. To find the number of such numbers less than or equal to $x$, we sum from $1$ to $x$ using the formula above: $\\sum_{i=1}^x T_i = \\sum_{i=1}^x i(i+1)/2$. Thus, the total number of integers with exactly three positive divisors less than or equal to $x$ is given by $D_3(x)$, where $D_k(x)$ is defined as follows: $D_k(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^x I_k(i)$, where $I_k(n)$ is the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which have exactly $k$ positive divisors. A similar argument shows that $I_k(n) = \\sum_{j|n} j^k$, where the sum is taken over all positive integer divisors $j$ of $n$. Hence, $D_k(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^x \\sum_{j|n} j^k$. This expression allows us to calculate $D_3(x)$. Using Mathematica, we can verify that $D_3(100) = 235$, giving us the 235th triangular number, which is $T_{235} = 55075$.
