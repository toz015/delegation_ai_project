After condition 3, Bob has all seven colors in his bag, and Alice's bag contains one less random ball. So, there are $\\binom{6}{1}=6$ ways to choose the ball that Alice removes from her bag. Alice's new bag will contain five random balls after adding the removed ball to Bob's bag. So, the number of ways to select Bob's final bag is $\\binom{6}{1}$ since there's one fewer ball from Alice's initial bag. Now, let's calculate the number of equally likely ways for Alice and Bob's bags to become identical. After condition 4, both Alice and Bob have a total of six randomly chosen balls. Thus, there are $\\binom{6}{6}=\\boxed{1}$ way for them to have identical bags. Therefore, the probability that the contents of the two bags are now identical is $\\frac{1}{36}$, which is approximately $\\boxed{0.028}$.

When Alice removes a ball, she has five remaining balls of the same colors, and so does Bob because Alice added that ball to his bag. After Bob removes a ball, both bags contain four balls of each color. Since there are six different colors, the total number of ways to select one ball out of six is 6, and the total number of ways to select one ball out of four is 4. Now let's count the number of possible outcomes where the contents of the two bags are identical. First, Alice can remove any ball from her original bag, giving us 6 choices. Then, Bob can remove any ball from his updated bag with Alice's ball, giving us 4 choices. Finally, Alice puts her ball into Bob's bag, and Bob puts his ball into Alice's bag. This leaves them each with five balls, which can be arranged in ${10\\choose5}$ ways. Putting it all together, the total number of ways to make them identical is $6*4*{10\\choose5}$.
