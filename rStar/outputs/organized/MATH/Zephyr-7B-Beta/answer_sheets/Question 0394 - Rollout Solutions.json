Since Brahmagupta plays optimally, the minimum and maximum values of $z$ should occur when Brahmagupta makes the best choice for himself.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $z$, let's find the critical points of $z$ and check whether they are local minima. The partial derivatives of $z$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ are:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} &= 4(2x - y)\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} &= -4(2x - y) - 4y\\\\\n\\intertext{Setting each derivative equal to zero, we get:}\n4(2x - y) &= 0 & \\Rightarrow & x = y,\\\\\n-4(2x - y) - 4y &= 0 & \\Rightarrow & y = 0 \\quad (\\text{since } x = y \\text", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Consider the function $z(x,y)$ describing the paraboloid\n\\[z = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y.\\]Archimedes and Brahmagupta are playing a game.
