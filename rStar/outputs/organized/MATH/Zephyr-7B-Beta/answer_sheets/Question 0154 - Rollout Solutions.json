The path the gecko takes along the ceiling follows a straight line segment with slope $0$, i.e., it follows the $x$-axis. So the equation of this path is $y=8$.

From the hint, we know that the horizontal distance between the gecko and the fly is 10 feet. Since the gecko cannot jump, it must move horizontally first. It can do so by moving along the top edge of the room's front wall. The height of this wall is 8 feet. To calculate how much of it the gecko needs to cover horizontally, we use the ratio of the horizontal distance divided by the width of the wall. The width of the wall is $12 - (10 - 1) = 1$ foot.
