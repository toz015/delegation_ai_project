The congruence equation looks like: $-11213141=18k+18r$, where $k$ and $r$ are integers. To solve this equation, we follow the same steps as before. Here's how it works: We want $-11213141$ to be equal to $18k+18r$. Since we're looking for an integer value of $k$, we need to make sure that the remainder when dividing $18k$ by $18$ is zero. Let's divide $18k$ by $18$: $k$ goes into $18$ times with a remainder of $r$, where $|r|\\leqslant 17$. Now, let's subtract $18r$ from both sides: $-11213141-18r=18k$.

Let's look at why this happens. From the hint above, we know that $k$ goes into $18$ times with a remainder of $r$, where $|r|\\leqslant 17$. Substituting this expression back into the original congruence modulo $18$, we get: $-11213141=18k+18r$. Now let's expand this expression using the definition of the remainder when dividing by $18$: $$-11213141=18(k+\\lfloor k/18\\rfloor)+18r$$ where $\\lfloor k/18\\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $k/18$.
