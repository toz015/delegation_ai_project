The definition of a function is usually written as $y=f(x)$, where $x$ is a variable and $y$ is calculated using some formula involving $x$. When we see a formula like $y=\\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, this means that $y$ is the quotient of $g(x)$ divided by $h(x)$. If $h(x)=0$, then division by zero occurs, causing an error. Therefore, the part of the definition of $f(x)$ that causes division by zero is when $h(x)=0$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Now let's find the values of $x$ for which either $|x^2+3x-4|=0$ or $|x^2+9x+20|=0$."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step using the hint provided. Setting $|x^2+3x-4|=0$ gives us $x^2+3x-4=0$, which cannot be true because the absolute value inside $|x|$ represents the distance from the origin, which cannot be negative. Similarly, setting $|x^2+9x+20|=0$ gives us $x^2+9x+20=0$, which cannot be true as the quadratic expression inside $|x|$ represents the position of the roots relative to the $x$-axis, and we know that the square root function is undefined for negative arguments. Since neither equation can hold true simultaneously, it follows that $f(x)$ does not have any restrictions on the values of $x$, implying that the whole real line is in the domain of $f(x)$, and therefore, the answer is: none.
