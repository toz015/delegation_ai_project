The projection is given by $(x, y)+(7-6)(6-5)=(7-6)(7-5)+(6, 8)=(1, 8)$, which is the left endpoint of the base when we rotate the parallelogram counterclockwise by $180^\\circ$. Therefore, the coordinate of the right endpoint is $(1, 8)+\\sqrt{17}(7-5)=(2, 8+\\sqrt{17})$. Since $x > 7$, this vertex lies to the right of the base.
