Now let's look at what happens when we redistributed the coins to get rid of the excess. For each bag, we take away some number of coins and add it to another bag. That means that each bag loses $d$ coins and gains $d$ coins, where $d$ is some difference. Before adding up the differences, notice that we're subtracting the same number of coins ($d$) from each bag, and adding the same number of coins ($d$) to each bag. Since there were originally seven bags, and there still are, the total number of coins cannot change. Hence, the total number of coins before distributing again is still $8x$.

Since we still have more than 200 coins, we know that $7y > 200$. From condition 2, we know that $7x = 8y$. Substituting $7y > 200$ into $7x = 8y$, we get $x = \\dfrac{16y}{8} = 2y$. So, before finding the bag of 53 coins, the smallest possible number of gold coins we could have had is $2y = x$, where $x$ is the original number of coins per bag, which is determined by $7x = 8y$.
