The answer is: $25 + 10\\sqrt{5}$ cm.\n\nCondition 2: There are $27$ white balls and $18$ blue balls in a box. How many more blue balls than white balls are there in the box?\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. To find the difference between two quantities, subtract the smaller quantity from the larger quantity. In this case, let's find the difference between the number of blue balls and the number of white balls. Since we know both quantities, we can write the difference as follows: Number of blue balls - Number of white balls. So, the difference is $18 - 27 = -9$. However, since negative quantities don't make sense in this context, we interpret the difference as meaning that there are $9$ fewer white balls than blue balls in", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
