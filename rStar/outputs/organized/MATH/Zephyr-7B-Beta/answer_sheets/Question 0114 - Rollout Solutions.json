However, when $x$ approaches $-8$, we get $CD=-x^2(-8+8)(-8-3)=-x^2(-5)(-11)$, which is a finite number that approaches negative infinity as $x$ approaches $-8$. When $x$ approaches $3$, we get $CD=x^2(3+8)(3-3)=x^2(11)(0)$, which is zero. Therefore, $CD$ approaches zero as $x$ approaches $3$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Now, let's substitute the value(s) of $x$ we found earlier into our expression for $CD$:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nCD &= x^2(x+8)(x-3)\\\\\n&= (\\sqrt{21}-1.25)^2(\\sqrt{21}+10.25)(-\\sqrt{21}-1.25)\\\\\n&\\quad+ (\\sqrt{21}+1.25)^2(\\sqrt{21}-1.25)(-\\sqrt{21}+1.25)\\\\\n&= (\\sqrt{21}-1.25)(\\sqrt{21}+10.25)(-\\sqrt{21}-1.25)\\\\\n&\\quad+ (\\sqrt{21}+1.25)(\\sqrt{21}-1.25)(-\\sqrt{21}+1.25)\\\\\n&= -1800\\cdot 2\\cdot (-2\\sqrt{21})\\\\\n&= \\boxed{3600\\sqrt{21}}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNote that $CD$ is undefined when $x=-8$", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
