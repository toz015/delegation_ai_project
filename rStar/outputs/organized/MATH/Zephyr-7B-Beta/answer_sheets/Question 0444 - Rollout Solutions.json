To calculate the probability of the chosen point being closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices, we need to find the ratio of the area inside the circle centered at $O$ with radius $r$ to the area of the rectangle $ABCD$. We know that the area of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $2a\\cdot 2a=4a^2$. The area of the circle centered at $O$ with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2$. So, the probability is $\\frac{\\pi r^2}{4a^2}$. Substituting $r$ and using the hint again, we have $r=a\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{d}{2a}\\right)^2}$.
