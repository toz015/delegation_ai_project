Exponentiating both sides with respect to 2, we get $2^8=4^x$. Now, let's use the exponent property that $a^m=b^m$, when $a$ and $b$ are of the same power, we get $2^8=4\\cdot4^{x-1}$. Simplifying the right side, we have $2^8=2^3\\cdot4^{x-1}$. Using the exponent property that $a^m=a^k\\cdot a^{m-k}$, where $k$ and $m-k$ are also powers of the same base, we get $2^8=2^3\\cdot 4^{x-1}$. Now, using the exponent property that $a^m=a^k$ when $m=k$, we have $x-1=3$. Adding 1 to both sides, we get $x=\\boxed{4}$.
