The answer is: (x = 144/220), (simplified fractional answer: 3\u221a[4]x/(2\u221a[4](3x-1)))", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "The answer is: $\\frac{144}{220}$.", "2": "To solve this equation, we need to cross-multiply: $\\sqrt{2x}\\cdot\\sqrt{3x-1}=\\frac32\\cdot\\sqrt{3x-1}$."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
