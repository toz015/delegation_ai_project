Each number has an equal chance of being selected, so Paul has a $\\frac{2}{6}$ or $\\frac{1}{3}$ chance of choosing 2, and he has a $\\frac{18}{6}$ or $\\frac{3}{1}$ chance of choosing 18. Since both players' selections are independent events, we can find the probability of this event occurring using the formula $P(E) = P(Paul\\ chooses\\ 2)\\cdot P(Jesse\\ chooses\\ odd)\\cdot P(even\\ sum) = (\\frac{1}{3})\\cdot(\\frac{1}{2})\\cdot(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$. Alternatively, we can use conditional probability to find the probability of Jesse choosing an odd number, given that the sum is even, and then finding the probability of Paul selecting 2 or 18. To do this, we need to calculate the conditional probability that Jesse chooses an odd number, given that the sum is even. Since we know that the sum is even, we also know that Jesse's selection is odd. There", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
