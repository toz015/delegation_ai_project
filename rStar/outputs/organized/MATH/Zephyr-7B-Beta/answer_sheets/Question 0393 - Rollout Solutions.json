Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We want the force applied by Jen to the softball to be equal to the force applied by Jack to the baseball. Force is defined as mass times acceleration ($F=m\\cdot a$). Setting these expressions equal to each other, we get:\n\n$$Jen:\\quad F_{softball} = m_{softball}\\cdot a_{softball} = 200g \\cdot a_{softball} = Jack :\\quad F_{baseball} = m_{baseball}\\cdot a_{baseball} = 150g \\cdot a_{baseball}$$\n\nDividing one equation by the other, we obtain:\n\n$$a_{softball} = \\dfrac{150g \\cdot a_{baseball}}{200g} = \\dfrac{3}{4}a_{baseball}$$\n\nThus, Jen's softball experiences a smaller acceleration than Jack's baseball. Specifically, the ratio of accelerations is: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{a_{softball}}{a_{baseball}} = \\dfrac{3}{4}}$. The answer is: 3/4.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
