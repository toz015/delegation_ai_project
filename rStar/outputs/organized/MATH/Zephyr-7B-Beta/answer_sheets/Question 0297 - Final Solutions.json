Since we want the smallest possible value of $n$, we want the smallest possible value of $x$. To minimize $x$, we need to make the expression inside the parentheses as small as possible. Note that $x$ is already a nonnegative integer, so we cannot make it negative. The smallest possible value of $7x+1$ is $0$, since $x$ itself cannot be negative. So, $7x+1=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=-1/7$. However, this is not a valid value of $x$, since $x$ must be a nonnegative integer. Therefore, $x=0$ is the smallest possible value of $x$.
