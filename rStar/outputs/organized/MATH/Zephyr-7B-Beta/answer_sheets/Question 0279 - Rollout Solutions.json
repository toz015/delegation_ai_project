To find the areas, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is $A=\\pi r^2$. The area of region $Z$ is $A_Z=\\pi(7)^2=49\\pi$. The area of region $X$ is $A_X=\\pi(4)^2=16\\pi$. The area of region $Y$ is $A_Y=\\pi(6)^2=36\\pi$. The difference between the area of the region with the greatest area and the area of the region with the smallest area is $A_Z-A_X=49\\pi-16\\pi=33\\pi$. Therefore, the difference between the areas is $\\boxed{33\\pi}$.
