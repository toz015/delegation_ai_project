Recall that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is the largest common divisor, while $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is the smallest common multiple. The expression $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$ tells us that both $a$ and $b$ have at most three prime factors. Since $a$ is less than $b$, it follows that $a$ cannot have more than three distinct prime factors.\n\nNow, since $a$ and $b$ share the same gcd of $210$, let's write out all possible factorizations of $210$. Any prime factorization of $210$ can be written as:\n\n$$ 210 = 2^4\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5 \\implies a = 2^{r_{a1}}3^{r_{a2}}5^0, b=2^{r_{b1}}3^{r_{b2}}5^0 $$\n\nwhere $r_{ai}$, $r_{bi}$ are non-negative integers satisfying:", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, and $a<b$, how many possible values are there for $a$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Can you find the prime factorization of $a$ and $b$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since $\\gcd(a,b)=210$, their prime factorizations must include only the primes that divide 210.
