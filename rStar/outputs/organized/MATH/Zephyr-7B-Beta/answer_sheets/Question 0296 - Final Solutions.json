For example, does the condition about the radius of a circle give us any insights into which equation might result in the largest value for $x$? Let's think about this. If the radius is between 0 and 3, and we're trying to find the largest possible value of $x$, it makes sense to consider equations that relate to circles, since the radius determines how large a circle can be. One possible equation that involves both $r$ and $x$ is $x=r\\cos(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is some angle between 0 and 2\u03c0 radians.
