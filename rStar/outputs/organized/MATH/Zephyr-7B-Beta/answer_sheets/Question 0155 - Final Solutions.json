Let's consider the points satisfying both conditions: all points inside the rectangle $[0,8]\\times[0,4]$ and below the line $x+y=4$. The set of all such points is the triangle with vertices $(0,4)$, $(0,0)$, and $(4,0)$ in Cartesian coordinates. To find the area of this triangle, use Heron's formula: $Area={1\\over2}bh$, where $b$ and $h$ are the base and height of the triangle, respectively. In our case, $b=4$ and $h=4-0=4$, so $Area=2\\cdot4\\cdot2=16$. Therefore, the area of the region containing the points satisfying both conditions is $16$.
