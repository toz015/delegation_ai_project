Let's consider the first car; it can choose any of the three lanes. For the second car, it also has three choices as the first car has already taken one lane. This process continues for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cars until each car has a choice of two available lanes. The number of ways to arrange six distinguishable objects in a row with some restrictions (i.e., each object has to occupy exactly one spot and cannot overlap with another object) is given by the formula $P(n,r)$, where $n$ is the total number of objects and $r$ is the number of positions to fill. In this case, $n=6$ and $r=3$, so the number of possible arrangements is $P(6,3)=\\dfrac{6!}{3!(6-3)!}=20$.
