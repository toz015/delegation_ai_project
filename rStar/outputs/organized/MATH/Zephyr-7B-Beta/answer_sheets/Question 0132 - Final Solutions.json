By condition 3, Rick and Steve are both considering the same integer divisor. By condition 1, the divisor of 14 is a positive integer. By condition 2, the divisor of 42 is also a positive integer. Let's call this common divisor $d$. Now, let's find the least possible value of $d$. Since 14 is a multiple of $d$, we can write $14=kd$ for some nonnegative integer $k$. Similarly, since 42 is a multiple of $d$, we can write $42=l d$ for some nonnegative integer $l$. Since $d$ is the smallest possible divisor common to both 14 and 42, we know that $k$ and $l$ cannot both be zero, because then $d$ would not be a common divisor. Without loss of generality, assume $k\\geq l$. Divide both sides of the equation $42=l d$ by $l$ to get $42/l = d$.
