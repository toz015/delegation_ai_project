Here\u2019s my proposed strategy:-First determine what exactly type variable transformation needed;this could range anywhere within linear algebra realms ranging up till higher order calculus depending upon context requirement.-Then identify relevant formulas available online relating closely enough concerning source material relevancy -there may exist specialized references focused explicitly addressing pertinent transformations sought during investigations performed thus requiring prior familiarity obtained earlier whilst studying fundamentals underlying subject area knowledge base beforehand-.If lack any background information previously acquired however still pursuing desired outcome nevertheless proceed ahead seeking guidance / help form external sources besides textbooks otherwise attempt recreating derivations independently employ mathematical reasoning skills already developed throughout course work completed sohither leading oneself closer toward complete comprehension achieved ultimately satisfying personal curiosity goals simultaneously fulfill academic prerequisites mandatory completion tasks assigned teacher instructor classroom lectures etc..
