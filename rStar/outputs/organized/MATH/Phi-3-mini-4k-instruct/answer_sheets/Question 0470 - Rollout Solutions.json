This step considers that if you apply AM-GM three times over five variables\u2014you're essentially equating them pairwise while ensuring they sum up to ten. Hence why 'bc', etc., appear inside parentheses under division signs; those represent additional applications of equality needed so our expression ends looking like just abc raised to various powers according to how often elements repeat across total summation constraints (\\(a+b+c+d=10\\)), which reflects using every term equally within overall product scope set forth initially but not exceeding individual variable limits defined by problem context ('positive reals').
