six-sided dice being thrown. Let \\( P \\) represent the event when exactly two out of those n dice display a non-1 face up upon rolling each die. When considering any individual die roll resulting in either 1 (\"one\") or not equal to one (which encompasses faces {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}), respectively denoted X=P(\\*) and Y=P(!\\*), since it\u2019s stated initially that every single die faced during this trial round was uniformly randomized \u2013 indicating no inherent bias towards landing on 'ones' versus \u2018non-ones,\u2019 both events possess identical probabilities represented mathematically via pX=pY=(1/6). Consequently, applying combinatory mathematics combined with said probabilistic foundations culminates into determining the required overall chance (\\( P \\)), correspondingly described within mathematical formalism employing binomial distribution expressions \\(\\binom n k * (p^{k}*(1-p)^{n-k})\\).

When dealing with standard six-sided dice ($d=6$), every roll offers 'six possibilities,' hence n dices yield a potential range of combinaisons equalling '$6^n$.' However, determining specific probabilities like exact duplicates involves combinatorial calculations taking into account orderings; it often requires advanced mathematical tools such as permutations/combinations along with binomial coefficients. For instance, let us denote P(X) - Probability function related to X event occurrences among N trials following Bernoulli distribution principles\u2014P(X;N,p) . Here p denotes success rate while q signifies failure chance computed via (q=1\u2212p). Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function comes handy too \u2014 F(k;N,p)=P(K\u2264k)+CDF[K< k].
