To calculate $513^2 - 487^2$, we can use the difference of squares identity: $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$. Here, let $a=513$ and $b=487$. Thus, $a+b = 513+487 = 1000$ and $a-b = 513-487 = 26$. Using the identity above, $513^2 - 487^2 = (513+487)(513-487) = 1000\\cdot26$. Multiplying out, we get $1000\\cdot26 = 26000$. Hence, the exact numerical value of $513^2 - 487^2$ is $26000$. The answer is: 26000.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "What is the value of $513^2 - 487^2$?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Can you factorize expressions like $a^2 - b^2$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Yes! It's known as the difference of squares formula which states that $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$. This property holds true because if we apply multiplication distributively over addition or subtraction inside parentheses (( ),), our expression expands back to its factored form ($(a+b)(a-b)$). So yes, I know how to handle such scenarios using mathematical properties and formulas. Applying this knowledge here simplifies things quite nicely since we only need basic arithmetic skills rather than advanced mathematics concepts beyond high school level understanding.
