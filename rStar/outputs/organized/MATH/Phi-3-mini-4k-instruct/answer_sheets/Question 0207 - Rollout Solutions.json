So if he'd like have *two* distinct toppings per pizza, as opposed to only one unique set across multiple slices/topics, they would appear under separate categories (*i.e.* you don\u2019t count `{tomato sauce}` being picked alongside `pepperoni` vs picking tomato instead alone); therefore she should consider her options separately according to having either (`no`) double counts allowed versus allowing duplicates within ordered pairs `(A, B)` wherein A &amp; C may pair same while still satisfying requirements e.g.: `[{(},{},),(Both_selections})]` meaning permutations which require equal consideration regardless whether ordering differs amongst constituent sets i.e., treat such scenarios identical rather distinguishing their sequential arrangement despite factual content remaining constant through said rearrangement thus ensuring equality irrespective positional differences\u2014this logic follows directly upon excluding unordered groups due solely based off lexicographical sequence alignment without regard towards actual composition variation hence fostering consistency throughout evaluation process thereby eliminating bias against those opting diverse approaches ultimately resulting uniformity achieved via mutually exclusive choices available hereby facilitating streamlined decision making procedures benefitting users alike.] Here again let me clarify my intention since previously mentioned clarification might lead readers astray\u2026 It means every time someone chooses something else other than pepperoni \u2013 say mushrooms\u2013makes our sum bigger because now people who didn\u2019t before also got another option added onto list so consequently increase amount total variety potential.. Therefore I think best explanation involves breaking down possibilities manually using formulas involving factorial notation shown below:\\\\[\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\\hline {\\text{Number Of Toppings}}&\\text{# Ways}\\\\ \\hline 0&{{8}\\choose{0}}=1\\\\ \\hline 1&{{8}\\choose{1}}=8\\\\ \\hline 2&{{8}\\choose{2}}=28\\\\ \\hline\\end{array}\\][1]: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial%7C8%7D [2]:", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Finally, add together the values obtained above to determine the total number of different pizzas Mikka can make.", "subanswer": {"text": "Adding the three quantities calculated yields $1 + 8 + 28 = 37$.

But since you cannot have fractions/decimals as your final solution here means our calculation needs revision because if taken literally would mean some 'order' does not exist resulting due to fractional possibility; therefore only whole integer values make sense hence giving proper solutions i.e., total no.of possibilities should also form part of those possible orders. So let me correct my previous statement now! After recalculating correctly while adhering strictly onto integers rather than decimals or fractions etc.: To determine how many unique pairs of toppings Mikka can pick without repeating them within themselves\u2014which implies selecting either single item OR pair but NOT triplets nor more complex arrangements such as triples being considered valid cases \u2014we must simply evaluate basic combinatorics formulas involving factorial functions like so: Firstly consider choosing just **ONE** distinct flavor option amongst dishes offering LETTERS A through H inclusive ('A',\u2009B,'C','D','E','F','G')and count occurrences accordingly via direct counting methodology thus avoiding double counts altogether whilst maintaining consistent logic flow throughout process regardless whether subset selection occurs based upon individual selections vs paired ones\u200a\u2014\u200aessentially reducing problem scope down further still thereby simplifying matters greatly indeed despite initial impression perhaps suggesting otherwise !
