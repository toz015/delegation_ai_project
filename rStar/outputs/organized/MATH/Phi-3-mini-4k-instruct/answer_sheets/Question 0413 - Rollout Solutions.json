Options: Option (A): Begin solving immediately after understanding all prior problems since they do not impact the current problem significantly. Option (B): Attempting solutions based solely on intuition may lead us astray\u2014carefully analyze expressions before applying mathematical principles like distribution property over addition or subtraction terms involving variables. We must account accurately for signs (+/-). Only use factorization techniques once familiarity with distributive law across products becomes apparent through exploration exercises earlier mentioned herein concerning polynomials & rational equations alike!
