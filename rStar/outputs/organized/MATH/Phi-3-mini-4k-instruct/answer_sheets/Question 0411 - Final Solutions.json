With initially six known witches (as indicated by Point T's location near waterfalls, often associated with magic sites), assuming each had to shake hands with everyone except themselves results in \\( C(6,2) \\) combinations since order doesn't matter when counting pairs. Thus, we calculate the combination function for selecting 2 items from 6 options, leaving zero overlapping cases. Using the formula for combinations (\\( nCr = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)! r!} \\)), plugging in \\( n = 6 \\) and \\( r = 2 \\), we get \\(\\frac{6!}{(6-2)! \\times 2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\\) potential handshakes. These include four couples (a maximum matching problem solution similar to solving the classic Stable Marriage Problem analogy), plus ten single standalone connections left because the last man couldn't form his own couple (since he could match nobody).

calculation since order doesn't matter; thus, you choose 2 out of n entities.
