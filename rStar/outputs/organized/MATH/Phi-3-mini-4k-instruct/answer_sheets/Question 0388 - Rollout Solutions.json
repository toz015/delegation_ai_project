Let\u2019s break down what needs to happen before simplifying the equation accordingly based upon your new example context while keeping focus towards understanding how manipulation affects outcome like so - |\u2212a|=\u00b1a; similarly now let us handle 'expression under square root': $$\\begin{aligned}\\color{blue}{(x-3)^{2}-(x-8)^{2}}&\\equiv\\underbrace{\\left(\\substack{\\color{", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "What is the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of the function $$g(x) = \\sqrt{(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2}~?$$", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. To determine the domain of the function, we need to consider when the value under the square root sign becomes negative because the square root of a negative number is undefined in the reals. Expanding both squares inside the parenthesis gives us $$\\sqrt{(x-3)^2 - (x^2-16x+64)} ~.$$ Simplifying further yields \\(\\sqrt{-x^2+22x-51}\\). For \\(g(x)\\) to yield a valid output (\\(\\ge 0\\)), the quantity within the radical (-x\u00b2 + 22x - 51) must also not lesser than zero i.e., it needs to stay nonnegative. Solving inequality \\[- x^{2}+22x-51\\geqslant 0\\] using standard quadratic solving techniques results into critical points as approximately \\(x=5.58\\) and \\(x=9.42\\). Checking intervals defined by these critical points shows that our desired interval falls entirely below one of them but above another; thus confirming our minimum possible solution lies right about halfway between those roots hence taking form around \\(x=7\\).
