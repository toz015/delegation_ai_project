You recognize it as a difference of squares since \\(x^2\\) stands alone while \\(9\\) is simply a perfect square (since \\(3^2 = 9\\)). Applying your knowledge here means writing our expression as \\(\\frac{y}{(x+3)(x-3)}\\), correct? Absolutely! Your identification of \\(x^2 - 9\\) being factored down using the difference of squares formula\u2014that turns", "subanswer": {"text": "Indeed, applying what I know about algebra allows me to rewrite the fraction as follows: \\[\\frac{y}{(x+3)(x-3)}.\\] As such, yes, my response aligns perfectly with the guidelines provided earlier. Moving ahead based on your instructions \u2014 let's analyze further which integer values cause issues within the context of divisions involved in mathematical expressions. So next up would involve finding those specific integer inputs; right? Precisely! Henceforth, focus shifts towards identifying instances causing undefined behavior typically associated with Zero Division Error situations. In simpler terms, could someone tell at once why certain intgers make no sense mathematically speaking particularly related to not allowing divide by zeros scenario mentioned previously Exactly! And now we arrive at unraveling said mystery concerning undefinability tied directly back to cases involving nonviable divisors leading invariably unto disallowed scenarios pertaining solely to division voidance circumstances", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Considering condition 3 regarding dividing by zero, we first look into when the denominator becomes zero because any value resulting in a zero denominator makes the entire expression invalid according to standard rules of mathematics. Now recall that our original expression was \\[f(x) = \\frac{(x - 5)}{(x^2 - 9)}.\\] Factorizing the denominator yields \\[(x + 3)(x - 3).\\] Thus, setting each factor equal to zero helps us pinpoint where the problem arises. Solving both equations individually results in x equals negative three (\\(x = -3\\)) and positive three (\\(x = 3\\)) respectively, representing the critical values making either part of the denominator disappear hence creating indeterminacies or infinity effects depending upon one's interpretation. Therewithal, combining these insights confirms unequivocally that exactly twice i.e., two separate integral figures namely minus three (-3) & plus three (+3) create problemsatic implications thereby ruling out potential output range limitations under consideration presently", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
