Repeat such process as follows: eight people scoring ninety gets us $8 * 90 = 720$, while twenty people getting one hundred equals $2 * 100 = 200$. Now combine those results ($1600+$720+$200$) to obtain our aggregate grade totals; thus yielding $2520$. Finally, take your combined grades divided by the quantity of individuals present ($\\frac {2520} {30}=84$). Thus, using multiplication/addition before division ensures proper order handling within PEMDAS principles - ultimately giving way to precise averaging methods applied herein! Henceforth concluded hence, indeed 'The answer is: 84'.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A class of 30 students recently took a test.

To calculate the class average (mean), you multiply each score by the number of students who received it, add up those products, and then divide by the total number of students. For scores of 80 earned by 20 students, you would compute $80 * 20 = 1600$. Likewise, eight students scoring 90 results in a product of $90 * 8 = 720$, while two students obtaining perfect marks contributes $100 * 2 = 200$. Adding together your three sums yields $1600 + 720 + 200=2520$. Dividing this figure into the full set of thirty pupils produces an average mark of $\\frac{2520}{30} = 84$. Thus, our solution indicates the overall grade obtained during the examination session averages out to 84%.

Firstly, recall that the formula used to calculate the Mean or Arithmetic Average $(m)$ , given `n` set of data items `(d_k)`, say : $$M=\\sum_{k} d_k / n$$where k ranges over {1,...,n}. Note here that 'mean', also commonly referred to as 'average', might sometimes refer specifically to *weighted* means while others may just denote regular unadjusted ones. Also worth mentioning too would be something called \"*geometric*\" & \"*harmonic*\u201c type measures which require nonlinear calculations whereas our approach uses linear algebra operations instead!
