Multiply $(1+2i)$ times $6$:\n$(1*6)+(2i*6)$= $6+12i$.\nNow let's substitute it into our original expression along with subtraction ($3i$) resulting in $6+12i-3i$, simplifying further yields us $6+9i$. Thus, evaluating $(1+2i) * 6 - 3i$ results in $6+9i$. Note here 'imaginary unit i represents square root of negative one.' .
