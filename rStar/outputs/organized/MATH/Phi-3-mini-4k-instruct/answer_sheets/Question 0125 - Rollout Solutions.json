The ceiling function rounds up any decimal value towards infinity when expressed as an integer. For instance, $\\lceil 3.6 \\rceil=4$, because rounding up 3.6 results in 4. Now let\u2019s evaluate each term separately. $(\\lceil 3.6\\rceil)^2=(4)^2=16.$ To calculate $\\lceil x \\rceil$ you need first to square the original number ($(3.6)^2$) but before squaring apply floor/ceiling functions so here I am calculating using just one example ($\\lfloor {(\\lceil 3.6\\rceil)} ^{2}\\rfloor$). Thus giving us our solution below.$\\lceil (3.6)^2 \\rceil -( \\lceil  3.6 \\rceil ) ^2=\\lceil ({3.6}^2)\\rfloor -( 4)^{2}=$$[\\lceil  12.96\\rceil ]-( 4)^{2}=[13]-16=-3.$$ The answer is: -3.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
