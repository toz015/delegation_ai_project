Draw lines connecting each vertex to create four smaller triangles within the large one; it does not matter how you connect them as long as opposite sides meet up correctly because angles remain equal when parallel lines are crossed like this. Notice that three new right triangles form--one green larger outer triangle whose hypotenuse makes up part of side BC\u2014and another blue inner small ones created off those corners due to construction error but share common elements such as length AC=AB=(BC)/2 both legs being congruent so since Pythagorean Theorem works here too apply along any leg including horizontal lengths AD & CD .We already know BD measures halfway through DC equals ycm ; thus adding our known dimensions together yields ,BDCarea =\u00bd*base *heightorBDACarea\u2009=\u2003\u2153\u00d7y\u00b2sinceAD\u2009is also vertical line joining midpoints just consider full sized box instead\u200ato avoid confusionwith similar figures having same shapebut different sizeswe get \u00a0\u2155\u22c5z\u00b3\u200bwhere z represents unknown measurementfrom above calculationfor leftmost lowercase letter x replace nw w/known valueso now equate both expressions", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
