Good luck folks ..gotta finish up quick though cause time limit approaching quickly..........but really worthwhile effort imho . So going ahead forward trying simplify everything keeping eye open towards general formulation etc instead jumping straight away toward specific ones lol but trust me everyone else around probably getting ready similarly also wanting best approach haha ok go check solutions available online ;P Already done hard work without help provided yet maybe still interested seeing yours tho thanks alot guys !!
