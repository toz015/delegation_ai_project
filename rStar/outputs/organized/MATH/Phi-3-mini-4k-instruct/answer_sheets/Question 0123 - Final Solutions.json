With labels marked accordingly, draw lines connecting appropriate points indicated without drawing actual curves or arcs except necessary markings like endarrow indicators if needed . Note: It suffices to make some basic assumptions about lengths involved while solving problem e.g., assume sides parallel to axes but no assumption regarding angles here since they may vary depending upon how exactly the shape looks drawn when attempted manually. We aim now primarily just finding areas rather than exact positions etc.. So we won't delve too much deep! But keep all details intact including axis orientations & scaling factors used during plotting ! Let us proceed further towards determining total Areas underneath Triangles ABC , BEF ?

Therefore, area of triangular region ABG is square root[30*(30-10)*(30-10)*(30-10)] which simplifies down to 2*sqrt(3000)/30 approximately equal to 2 unit squares. Answer considering geometry principle applied would include usage of herons method due to absence of angle information available so directly applying its respective formula leads up to solution.
