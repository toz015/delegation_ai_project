Condition 1:  The expression we want to maximize or minimize is $ab^2 c^3 d^4$, subject to certain constraints. Condition 2: We know that all four variables ($a, b, c, d$) must add up to 10 since they represent positive real numbers together forming their summation equals ten. To solve this problem optimally, we use AM-GM inequality because it relates arithmetic mean (AM) to geometric mean (GM).
