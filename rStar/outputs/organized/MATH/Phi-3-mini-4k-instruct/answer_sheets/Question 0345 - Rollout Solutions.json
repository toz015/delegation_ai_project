We want both graphs to either cross or coincide only once within our specified range. That means they must share no more than one tangent! To guarantee uniqueness we don't allow them to ever overlap except possibly through vertical asymptotes because if the functions were identical everywhere but had infinitely close horizontal intercepts those would count twice towards intersections even though they occur along curves rather than straight lines.\" I need my analysis focused solely on trigonometric identities involving cosines without utilizing Euler's formula.\",", "ost_step": {"1": "Consider the general form of a secant curve: $$ h(x) = \\sec(kx) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(kx)} .$$", "2": "Recall the identity $$\\cos(\\theta) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta\\right)$$for any angle \\(\\theta\\).
