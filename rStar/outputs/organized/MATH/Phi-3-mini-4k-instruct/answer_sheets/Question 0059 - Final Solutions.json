According to the problem statement, we need to calculate the intersection of sets $M$ and $S$. Using Venn diagrams, it becomes clear that some students might fall into more than one group. Thus, the cardinality of the union of sets $M$ and $S$, denoted as |$M \\cup S$|, equals the total number of distinct elements belonging to either set. From what was specified earlier, out of 50 students, six do not join any clubs, leaving us with forty four eligible participants. To determine the size of intersections based off information known about disjoint groups alone isn't sufficient - especially when assuming absolute nonintersection implies full independence leading erroneously to false exclusion errors potentially compromising accurate result accuracy causing unintended misrepresentations adversely impacting subsequent analyses rendering efforts effectively futile unless supplementary data sources offering independent validation measures utilized subsequently corroborated initially computed estimates align accurately corresponding true observed results uphold veracity integrity maintain legitimacy"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's breakdown the question first before solving using formulas related to Set theory; specifically focusing on De Morgan\u2019s Law & Principle of inclusion/exclusion here because our goal involves finding commonality among subsets rather than dealing directly with individual counts within each subset like usual overlap problems would demand under typical circumstances i.e., counting members inside boxes while avoiding duplications etc..
