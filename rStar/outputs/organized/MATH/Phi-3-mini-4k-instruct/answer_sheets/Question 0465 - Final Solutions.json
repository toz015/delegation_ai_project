Condition 1:  We want to find a specific type of positive integers when they are arranged in increasing sequence based on their property described next. Condition 2: These integers all possess only three unique factors \u2013 namely, one, themselves, and another factor besides those mentioned above, implying prime powers or products involving them exclusively. Condition 3: Specifically addressing our quest hereafter, we aim to identify precisely five instances among these particular integers ordered sequentially starting with 'one.' Question: Which numeral marks its place being the tertiary entry once sorted accordingly under said criteria?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Identify what kind of integer meets condition (ii)? This would imply either primes raised to some power greater than one; thus yielding composite figures but ones which contain solely squares as other divisors apart from unity itself alongside the base count...

guidance in selecting special categories of numbers known as perfect squares multiplied by different factors aside from themselves and potentially added together to create larger sums - also termed quadratic residues derived from applying Euler's theorem concept applied repeatedly onto individual counts leading us eventually to encounter various permutations until arriving at exactly 5 positions following proper sorting considering specified constraints centered mainly around repetitive operations concerning whole sets resulting in outputs limited strictly to triplets signifying basic addition results combined into pairs exhibiting increased complexity stemming directly outwardwards rather than central origination indicative characteristic behaviors associated typically found
