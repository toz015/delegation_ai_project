Let us dissect each query separately starting with condition one considering it represents 'Variables'. Herein lies the premise of setting out definitions prior - namely stating that `$a$,` `$$b$$`, and `$$c$$` encapsulate distinct entities corresponding respectively to Real Numbers (`Real`), Positive Whole Numbers (`PositiveIntegers`) indicating Zero Exclusion criterion along with Nonnegative Entities(`Nonnegatives`). An extension to include Fractions ('Ratios') alongside Decimals('DecimalNumbers'), excluding Negative Figures explicitly adds another dimension whilst concurrently holding onto strictly Numeric Constructs. Henceforth alignments necessitated pivoting approach accommodating Expansiveness versus Precision Tradeoffs inclusive Comprehensibility vis-\u00e0-vis Complexity Management.
