{"text": "To analyze the situation described about creating smaller results from squared negative semiprimes modulo prime squares, it appears that no efficient algorithm exists without resorting to brute force enumeration tests because each value needs to fall under multiple categories simultaneously - specifically requiring three distinct primes p', q', r' with unique exponents e1 <= e2 <= ... <= ek for k > 1. As the text suggests, even though one may attempt polynomial running times up until O(\u221aNlog N), the nature of intersecting intervals makes achieving significantly lower runtimes computationally intractable. Despite attempts aimed at exploiting symmetries or developing advanced counting approaches related to combinatorial mathematics, Mersenne Twister sequences, generalized gamma function approximations, generating functions, Eulerian polynomials, inclusion\u2013exclusion, and Stirling coefficients, none manage to offer substantial improvements against cubic runtime barriers represented mathematically by Delta Big Omega Notations, unless explicit exceptions exist \u2013 although identifying concrete counterexamples proves difficult despite considerable efforts documented online.
