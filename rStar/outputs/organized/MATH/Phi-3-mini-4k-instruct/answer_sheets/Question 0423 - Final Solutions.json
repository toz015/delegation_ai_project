To solve this problem, we need to apply modular arithmetic principles. Let x represent our unknown quantity. Our conditions state three separate equations derived through division remainders:\n\n1. When dividing x by 7, the remainder is 5; mathematically represented as \\(x\\equiv 5(\\mod{7})\\)\n\n2. Similarly, when dividing x by 11, the remainder is 10 (\\(x\\equiv 10(\\mod{11})\\)).\n\n3. And lastly, dividing x by 13 results in a remainder of 10 (\\(x\\equiv 10(\\mod{13})\\)).\n\nThis forms what\u2019s known as congruence relations, setting up simultaneous linear Diophantine equation systems due to each relation being independent yet interconnected via 'x'.
