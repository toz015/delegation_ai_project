What is the minimum number of degrees it must be rotated until it coincides with its original position?", "ost_step": {"1": "There are five sides in a regular pentagon because n=5 represents a polygon with 'p' equal angles as p/n=(sum of interior angles)/(number of vertices * 180). Here, each angle measure equals [(n - 2)*180] / n, or [5*180] / 5 = 180\u00b0; however, since consecutive angles meet one another inside the figure, each measures half that amount, i.e., 90\u00b0. Thus, any rotation equivalent to some multiple m*(the degree measurement within a complete turn) would also coincide with the initial configuration--which implies every whole revolution completes a return to start without distinction amongst them except whether lesser effort was exerted upon first execution. Hence our objective becomes identifying smallest possible value among those viable multiples whose product when multiplied against chosen modulus remains congruent throughout duration whilst ensuring minimal work invested initially yet retain maximal efficiency subsequently...and thus arrives conclusion drawn herein under review presented below accordingly!

To coincide with its original position, each vertex of the pentagon must return to its starting place through one full rotation around the central axis.
