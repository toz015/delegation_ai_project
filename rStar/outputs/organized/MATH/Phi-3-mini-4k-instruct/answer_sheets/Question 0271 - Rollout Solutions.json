One way to do it is using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm; however, because our numbers are small enough, let us try some guesses until finding one that works. By trial, checking multiples of 997, we get that $$997\\cdot 1=997$$ which leaves a residue of -1 when divided by 1000. Hence multiplying both sides by $-1$ yields the following equality $${-997}\\cdot997=-1.$$which also holds true due to distributivity rule since ${-1}=(-1)\\cdot1.$ Thus, solving above equation via substitution proves that $$\\begin{align*} {-997}\\cdot997 &= (-1)(997)\\\\ &\\equiv -1 \\pmod {1000}\\\\ &\\equiv  999.\\end{align*}$$Therefore, ${\\displaystyle 997^{-1}}\\mod{1000}={-997}\\mod{", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Compute $997^{-1}$ modulo $1000$.

Condition 1:  We want to find the inverse of the number $997$ under multiplication modulo $1000$. Condition 2: Modular arithmetic involves finding remainders when integers are divided by another fixed integer known as the modulus ($1000$ in our case). Question: What is the remainder after dividing the product resulting from multiplying $-29$ and its inverse found in step 1 by $1000$? Note: Since we need the result in range $(0,\\! 999)$, if your calculated answer exceeds this interval wrap around backward through the residue system defined above until you get a final value lying inside said boundary set up originally mentioned hereinabove. To solve the problem, let us denote $[m]$ as representing taking the remainder upon division by $1000$. That means $[m]=r$ implies $m = q \\times 1000 + r$ for some quotient $q$. Now, since we are looking for the multiplicative inverse of $997$ modulo $1000$, we essentially seek an integer $v$ such that $$997 v \\equiv_{1000} 1.$$This congruence equation tells us that multiplying $997$ by $v$ gives us a multiple of $1000$ plus $1$. Let\u2019s assume without loss of generality that $997 v=-29$; then$$(-29) v \\equiv_{1000} (-29)$$and hence $$\\left([-29](-29)\\right)=[-7649]=[769],$$giving us exactly enough leeway required to satisfy both given equations simultaneously.
