The area of the rectangle $[0,8]\\times [0,4]$ equals $|\\mathbb R|$: $|ABCD|=16$, which means that any part of said rectangle could match our requirements under independence assumptions about how randomness works here. Thus $$P(\\text {the }p\\text{-area}) =\\dfrac {|\\triangle OA'D|}{|\\mathbb R|}=\\dfrac{|OB||OD|}{|\\mathbb R|}$$ Note also that because $B$ lies entirely below line segment $AC$, so too must lie every other dot inside square ABCD -- implying equality between areas! And since triangles share bases parallelly aligned across horizontal planes , their height ratios should hold constant throughout space . Hence $$\\dfrac {PA'} P_B = |\\triangle COD|$$ In particular,\\[\\begin{aligned}\\dfrac {\\overline{(OP)}} {\\overline{(OP')}} &= \\dfrac{\\overline{[OC]} [\\overline{[COD]}]}{\\overline{[OC]} [\\overline{OB}\\,+\\, \\overline{OD}]}\\\\ &=\\dfrac{\\overline{[BO\\,+\\, AD]}}{\\overline{[OB}\\,+\\, AD]} \\\\&=1\\end{aligned}$$ Finally substituting values yields \\[\\dfrac{\\bar AB\\,\\,\\,[\\quad (\\bar BC +\\quad)\\quad ]}{\\;\\;(\\bar BM +\\quad)\\, \\, \\quad}\\,\\,\\,[\\quad\\, (c)]\\;:\\;\\;\\\\&=\\dfrac{16}{16}\\\\=1\\] So overall probabilty becomes equalized against certain events occurring via uniform distribution theory applied along axes perpendicularity principles !!!
