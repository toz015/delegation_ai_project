The area of a parallelogram formed by four linear equations can be found using determinants as follows: \\[Area = |ab - ac|.\\] For the first set of parallel sides, $|ad - ab|$ represents the absolute difference in areas when comparing side lengths along either pair of opposite sides ($ac$ versus $bd$). Thus, \\(|ab - ad|\\) equals half the original area because both expressions yield twice the length times width but one includes negative contributions due to reflection over y-axis; therefore it equates exactly halves our desired outputted 'area'. Hence \\(\\dfrac{|ab - cd|}{2}=18\\); solving yields no unique solution yet since any multiple combinations would give valid results hence proving irrelevant under stated constraints thus forcing us towards another methodology involving geometry rather than algebraic manipulation alone so let\u2019s proceed geometrically instead focusing solely upon differences amongst variables involved within respective equation pairs giving rise ultimately directly impactful changes regarding scale transformations themselves while disregarding previously derived relationship altogether allowing easier comparison subsequently resulting into obtainment single most desirable outcome immediately through observation i.e., minima among them being critical importance thereby leading naturally toward minimum aggregate summation once satisfied minimizing", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
