Choice set: {Angles} An appropriate description may begin like \u201cThe ___.\u201d or more naturally \u201cIt\u2019s called __\u201d. \\_ indicates blank spaces for additional descriptive words. \\[image\\] Angle Gamma | Rectangle ABCD |\\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \\hline Vertices & Names:\\\\ M&J&\\hspace{.03in}\\\\ T&O&\\hspace{.03in}\\\\ I&&G\\\\ Q&P&F\\\\ E&&H\\hdashline \\end{tabular}| Image caption: Convex Quadrilateral With Right Angles And Other Properties Name nameDescription Type PolygonRectangleConvex Four-Sided FigureQuadrilateralsRight angledTwo internal angles measuring  90\u00b0Angle alphaGamma Alpha -- GBAngle betaBeta -- FOBAlpha plus gamma equals 180 because they are supplementaryTherefore,\\alpha+\\beta=\\boxed{180}$. Answer:$$(a+b)+(90+90)=180$$$a+b=0$$But we know that none of them could possibly be negative, since no angle size would ever yield negatives when measured counterclockwise around its corner.Since none of those quantities makes sense mathematically, if nothing else, then our image contains some faults.So let us review how polygons work\u2026For starters, never forget about exterior measures!Exterior MeasureAn external quantity relating back only indirectly to another part of the same object. It represents something outside itself \u2026 just look closely enough.In fact , looking closer reveals that OQ also bisects AC but again without cutting through anything solid.That tells us even before considering diagonals their intersection divides up sides equally \u2013 meaning triangles formed along either path share corresponding base lengths across horizontal planes parallel above vs horizontally beneath .
