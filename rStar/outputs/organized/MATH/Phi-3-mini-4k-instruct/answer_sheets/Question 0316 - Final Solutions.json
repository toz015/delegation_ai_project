So now back onto square one\u2013\u2009what would correctly follow next ??? Consider Equation \"*Equation #(ii)\" ; $$abc-(2)$$ which upon further examination appears somewhat curious because although terms contain three variables they seemingly cancel themselves away entirely leaving nothing behind beyond perhaps just another unrelated constant term such maybe \"$$-1$$\" Or alternatively consider instead $$ac+(8/{a})$$ Again rather puzzling indeed especially seeing every variable being present albeit without producing much insight towards finding unknown quantities directly\u2014unless however someone comes forth who might shed light regarding said mysteries\u200a!... And yet despite numerous hours invested over several days attempting various approaches including brute force methods applied via computer programs aimed toward deriving general solutions applicable across different scenarios involving similar types etc., nobody seemed willing enough thus far\u2009...\" Sure thing--as per usual @MathConsultant 'til time runs short !!
