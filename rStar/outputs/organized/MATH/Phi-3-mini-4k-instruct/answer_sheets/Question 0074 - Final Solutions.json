Now substitute them into your equation : After substitution you get: [$$\\frac{1/\\cos x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}$$, Simplify further ] You realize next time it reads more clearly because rewriting fraction denominators under single common denominator might help reduce complexity: It would look similar to: [(multiply numerator & denominator inside first bracket with sin x],[(multiply numerator & denominator outside second parentheses with cos x] Hence now transform fractions again considering signs present within brackets: Finally obtain something looking somewhat tidier upwards!
