Add 10 to each side giving:  \n$10^x = 10000$. Take the common logarithm (base 10) of both sides yielding:   \n$\\log(10^x) = \\log(10000)$, apply properties of logarithms resulting in:     \n$x*\\log(10) = \\log(10000)$. As the value of $\\log(10)$ is one because any nonzero real number raised to the zero power always equal to one i.e., $\\log_{b}(b^k) = k$, so you get    \n$x = \\log_{10}(10000)$, finally simplify further knowing that 10^4 = 10000, therefore      \n$x = \\log_{10}(10^4) = 4$.

Given the equation $10^x - 10 = 9990$, our goal is to isolate x. By adding 10 to both sides of the original equation ($10^x - 10 + 10 = 9990 + 10$), you get $10^x = 10000$. Recognizing that any time base equals ten raised to some power results in one followed by four zeros, you identify that such condition holds when the exponent matches that count; hence $10^4 = 10000$. Consequently, comparing exponents leads us directly to conclude that $x=4$. Thus, based solely upon your", "value": 0.625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
