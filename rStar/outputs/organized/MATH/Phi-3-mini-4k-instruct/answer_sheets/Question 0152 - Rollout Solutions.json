By definition, the centroid splits the medians into parts whose lengths maintain a specific ratio \u2013 namely 2:$1$ going toward the midpoint of the opposite side and vice versa starting from the vertices. When lines parallel to another set of lines go through corresponding division points created by transversals cutting straight angles (\\textit{$BC$} in particular), various collinearity rules come into play due to proportional subdivisions resulting in smaller copies inside larger shapes based on similar figures principles.
