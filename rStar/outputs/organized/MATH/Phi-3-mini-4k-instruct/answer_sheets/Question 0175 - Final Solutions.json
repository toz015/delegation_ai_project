Their speeds give them relative speed when moving toward one another: John walks at 4 km/h while Peter moves backward at 2 km/h. When they meet, together they cover the entire length of the road (\\( x + y \\)). Thus, based on their combined rates, time taken before meeting can also be expressed using rate times time equals work done relationship; thus: \\(\\text{Time} = \\frac{x + y}{\\text{Relative Speed}} = \\frac{x + y}{4 + 2}\\) hours.
