Thus reflecting about the unit circle passing though origin perpendicularly to vector $[4,3]$ brings the coordinate system axis defining 'y'-axis downward until intersecting ('cutting')the circumference once more.(This also demonstrates why keeping track of orientation matters!)Since reflections leave length preserved --invariant-- they cannot move any distances parallel to either axes nor rotate around those without violating axiomatic conditions regarding nondegeneracy (i.e.; preserving convex combinations too)! Moreover note while angles remain constant during rotation alone (*counterclockwise direction only*, recall definition relative angle vs arc centered upon common vertex ) rotations preserve lengths everywhere else hence should not change magnitude except perhaps after completing full revolutions ; therefore changing nothing must mean zero net displacement overall despite possibly altering individual components individually(*but together still form exact copies themselves anyway?) ).
