Note that only prime factors lesser or equal to 5 affect whether bisects underneath gcd(). Only consider cases when we use all nonzero primes up to five ($p \\in \\{2, 3, 5\\}$). Since multiplying numerator and denominator changes fractions without changing ratios,\\nthe resulting answers must satisfy $|q_m| > |q_f|$ if they differ based on how much larger q was after multiplication compared to p beforehand.(In particular, since $-2 \\leq 2p_{kle}-1 \\leq 2$ holds true regardless of klesort order due to modular reduction properties.) Similarly $(\u22123)^k(|q_m|^2 \u2212 q_{km}^2)=(\u22121)^{k+1}(\u22123^{k}|q_m|)+(-3)^{k}(\u22123^{k}){|q_m|}>((\u22121)^{k}(\u22123^{k}))^2+(\u22123^{k})^{(k+1)}>0,$so taking reciprocal gives$(\u22123)^{-k}/|r_m|<\\sum_{\\ell<k}(\u22123)^{\\ell}=q_{kl}+(-3)^\\ell>(\u22121)^{k+1}$.Thus starting w/\\begin{cases}{(\u22123)^{-1}}\\div|r_m|&lt;&gt; {({\u22123}^{-k})\\over|r_m|}\\\\{(\u22123)^{-k})\\over|r_m|}&lt;&gt; {{\u22123}^{k}}={q_{kk}+\\cdots}...{{\u22123}^\\ell\\\\&\\quad\\,\\vdots}\\,\\end{cases}$Since ${(-3)({-3})^{-k}}$($=\\bigl\\{{{(-3)^{-\\varepsilon}-\\left({\\large{\\!-3^{\\,-{\\scriptsize\\Large\\!\\!-}\\varepsilon}}\\right)}\\over {\\left({\\large{\\!-3^{-\\varepsilon}}\\right)}{\\left({\\large{\\!-3^{\\,\\,-{\\scriptsize\\Large\\!\\!-}\\varepsilon}}\\right)}}}{\\small+\\left(2{{\\large{\\*}}({-3}^{\\,-", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Let's represent the repeating part as 'abc'.

You mentioned `x = bar{1} - bar{2} i`, which indicates complex conjugate subtraction in terms of imaginary unit `i`. Before proceeding, it appears there could be confusion because usually bars notation doesn\u2019t directly apply unless specifically defining something else like Fourier transform conventions.
