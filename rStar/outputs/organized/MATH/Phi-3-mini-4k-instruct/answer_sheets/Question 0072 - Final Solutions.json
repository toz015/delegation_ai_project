For any sphere, it holds true as follows: V=\u03c0*r\u00b3 , SA = 4\u03c0 * r\u00b2. Equating those terms yields :  \u03c0*r\u00b3 = 4\u03c0*r\u00b2, thus simplifying leads to :     r\u00b2 = 4 =>      r = sqrt(4)    Hence, the value of \u2018r\u2019 satisfies condition 1 - It turns out such radii exists when you consider every possible scenario since our equation derives itself directly from known relationships within geometry.
