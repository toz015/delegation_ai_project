Condition 1:  Triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is drawn inside a circle, with angle $\\angle A$ measuring $14^\\circ$. Condition 2: Side $AB$ acts as the diameter of the circumscribing circle around $\\triangle ABC$. Question: Calculate the measure, in degrees, of angle $\\angle B$ within the triangle. To solve problems involving triangles inscribed in circles, especially those related to angles subtended by diameters or chords, we often use properties specific to semicircles and cyclic quadrilaterals. Here, since side $AB$ serves as the diameter of the circle containing $\\triangle ABC$, key geometric principles apply. One pivotal fact states that if a triangle is inscribed in a circle such that one of its sides is also the diameter of the circle, then the angle opposite the diameter is always a right angle (this stems from Thales' theorem). Therefore, given our scenario, knowing that $\\angle A = 14^\\circ$, we conclude directly about angle $\\angle C$: because $\\angle ACB$ must oppose the diameter ($AB$), hence making $\\angle C$ a right angle ($\\angle C = 90^\\circ$). Now focusing solely on finding the size of $\\angle B$, recalling that the sum of internal angles in any triangle equals exactly $180^\\circ$, we simply subtract the known angles from $180^\\circ$ to find missing measures\u2014specifically herein applying them to determine $\\angle B$.
