Option C also doesn't fit because no even integer except 2 among any pair would result into a prime when multiplied together. Difficulties arise while determining correctness of options E & F directly due to lack of specific information but let us attempt anyway.. Accordingly : Let n= first even number => 2*(n+2) =  288 =>    n=(288/2)-2=>     n=142 - 2 =>      n=140 And hence according to definition; Second Number ==>  n+2 ; i.e.,       (Second Even Integer)=142 Now check whether either exists such instance satisfying criteria of Options :- As obvious From above calculation second value does lie below 18 therefore eliminating Option [A].

Let one of the even integers be $x$, so the next consecutive even integer would be $x+2$. Given that their product equals 288, we can set up the equation $x(x+2)=288$. Expanding the left side gives us $x^2+2x=288$. Rearranging terms yields $x^2+2x-288=0$. Factoring this quadratic equation results in $(x-16)(x+18)=0$. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us possible solutions of $x=16$ and $x=-18$. However, since negative even integers don't make sense here, our solution is $x=16$.
