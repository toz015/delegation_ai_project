Hence, integers greater than two form its feasible set i.e [3,...,infinity). However, since we need nondimensional inputs, considering natural numbers only makes sense now. Therefore, among them the minimal possible starting value seems suitable here being three because replacing \u2018two\u2019 within brackets yields \u201cnot applicable\u201d hence making no contribution towards reducing numeral count downwards whilst also ensuring uninterrupted calculation across entire interval.
