To prove equality requires additional effort but suffice here; geometric construction shows AC passes through origin so probabability equals one. Answer 5.1: Using similar triangles OPB ~ OFH ($OP||FH$), therefore $$\\frac{|OB|}{|OF|}=\\frac{|PD|}{PF}$$ $$PF={OD}/{DB}*PH$$ Where H denotes intersection of circle centered at F passing thru C & tangent at B perpendicularly intersecting line DC extended at E.$$PF=[DF*(BO+OC)]/(BF)$$ And substituted known values leads up above expression being just $|OH|^2=(K_o*h)(2KB)$. Proceed similarly for other segments leading ultimately to simplification giving desired final formula after factorial manipulation yielding Area$(ABC)=Area({CFED})\\sim K_{oc}^2 h^{2}(K_{dc})^2 c^{2}$ Therefore assuming uniformly distributed random variable over entire square region enclosing said quadrilateral yields Desired probabilty...and also proves Equality case stated within problem statement itself!
