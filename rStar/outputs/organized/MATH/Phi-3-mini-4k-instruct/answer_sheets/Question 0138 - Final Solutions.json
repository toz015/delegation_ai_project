For simplicity's sake, assume Bob receives a Ball ('B') first followed by Alice giving away a 'B'. Afterward, whichever player received 'B' now becomes responsible for selecting next, adhering to probability rules dictating that each nonzero option appears twice more often compared to zeros appearing thrice less frequently.
