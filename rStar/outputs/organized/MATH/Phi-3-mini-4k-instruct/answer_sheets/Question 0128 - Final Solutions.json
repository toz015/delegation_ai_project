Assuming 'fewest number of miles', you may interpret it to ask when Suzanne starts her cycle afresh within a calendar month rather than accumulating further distances. Here's why: If someone asks for \"the least amount\" related to mileage while assuming routine exercise sessions throughout the specified duration regardless of frequency changes, technically speaking, even a single session yields zero additional meters upon reaching full completion.

Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nSince Suzanne starts her schedule afresh with either Sundays occurring right after Mondays but skipping Tuesdays, those sets consist exactly of seven active/nonrestful days plus six complete stretches into subsequent weeks when both Saturdays occur immediately preceding them. Each eight-day interval features just five possible pedal pushes because once you hit March 8th, even though April begins precisely on January 3rd itself according to our Gregorian calendar reckoning system \u2013 meaning midsummer still hasn't arrived yet!
