distribution according to your first hint (focus purely on straight forward evaluations devoid of unnecessary explorations):\nStart by organising it into familiar polynomial forms: \\[ (ab + 5b) + (2a + 10) \\] Now perform basic operations - Add both sets individually since no same variable multiples share basis for combining differently denoted terms at present stage.\\[ ab + 5b + 2a + 10 \\] There isn't anything more obvious to simplify without assumptions regarding relationships between different types of terms -- i.e., treating \u2018a,\u2019 \u2019b,' etc. independently unless indicated otherwise.\r\rMoving onto second hints involving repetition removal--with regards again to individual type treatment suggested already: No apparent way exists to repeat/reduce quantities because each item differs significantly.'a', 'b','etc..'. Removal seems fruitless.*No reduction technique observable suggesting duplication even though some might perceive possibility seeing subtraction involved later.--Hints third suggests closer look applied backward to original setup may illuminate useful adjustments missed prior:'We see repeated use of integers'+10+'", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 13}]
