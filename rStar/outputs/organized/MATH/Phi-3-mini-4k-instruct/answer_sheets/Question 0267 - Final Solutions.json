Condition 1:  There exists a circle labeled $J$ centered at $(0,0)$.   Condition 2:  Two lines pass through the center of this circle forming angle $\\angle HOJ$ with another pair of lines also passing through the same location creating angles measuring exactly half their measure respectively. These four pairs of intersecting lines create eight smaller circles or segments inside larger circles called arc sectors, all sharing radii congruent to lengths specified above. One section starts off being completely surrounded without having even contact with its outer boundary while others begin touching only once before meeting along opposite sides eventually completing their path across both boundaries ultimately returning back to starting positions after traversing around either end entirely resulting in shapes formed similar enough patterns throughout depending how far apart they may travel internally based upon distance traveled externally but never actually crossing over due lack sufficient space available given constraints involved during formation process thereby leaving gap spaces left untouched thus remaining open areas free until filled again if needed later because time passes quickly when working alone here today though hopefully everyone gets busy next weekend doing something fun together somewhere nearby tomorrow night sometime soon ; ) .
