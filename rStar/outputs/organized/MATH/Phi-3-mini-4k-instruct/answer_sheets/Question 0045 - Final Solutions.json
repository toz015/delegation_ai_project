Hence 4/sec\u00b2A - 1= sec\u00b2A \\\\ Step 4: Convert into terms of sine using Pythagorean identity. Thus x=(\u221a5)/2 , y=(\u221a5)/2 hence tanA= y / x = ((\u221a5)/2 )/( (\u221a5)/2 )=1 : Answer:: The answer is: \\( \\mathbf{1} \\) . Please note that no specific reference was made as part of instruction regarding any other side length; therefore I assumed it applies universally regardless of what value you give them. For example, let\u2019s say BC = z instead of being just one unit long \u2013 your calculation would still work because ratios remain constant even though absolute lengths may vary based upon how big or small the right triangle gets compared against itself over time! If someone were asking me about triangles outside \u201cright\u201d classification categories like obtuse ones (which aren\u2019t possible here since B already measures precisely ninety degrees\u2026 unless somehow Angles C > A ),etc., my response might change accordingly\u2013 but those scenarios fall beyond our current discussion topic so won\u2019t affect anything else within scope today :)"}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
