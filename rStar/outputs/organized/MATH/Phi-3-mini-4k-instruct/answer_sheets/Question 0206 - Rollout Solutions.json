Condition 1: \u200bIn mathematics, lines like those above may sometimes be referred to simply as linear functions or affinely parametrizations when they describe some function mapping input \\(t\\) onto coordinate vector \\(\\left( {\\matrix{ {x} \\\\ {y} } \\\\ \\right)\\) . Condition 2: The given problem refers to finding parameters of the slope ($m$) and intercept ($b$) based on provided coordinates corresponding to 'parameterization'. We need to determine if we know how to find the slope ($\\dfrac{{dx}}{{dt}}$ )and intercept ('rise over run') formulae related to our vectors involved here (\\((2,3)\\)). Based upon known principles about slopes derived from trigonometry & algebra ,we understand that '$m=\\dfrac{{\\Delta y}}{{\\Delta x}}$, hence substituting,\\($m=\\dfrac{{3}}{{2}}$.

However, your reference seems to imply discussions around analytical representation through algebraic expressions involving variables\u2014think something similar to defining dynamic systems within Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates where independent variable symbols might denote physical quantities varying continuously across temporal axes. Such discourse usually involves concepts encapsulating elements including derivatives which quantify rates changes occurring naturally under specified rules governing their respective domains e.g., motion physics laws etc.).
