whole entity into another smaller unit repeatedly. Using mathematics particularly Number Theory allows us to understand better how objects group together neatly - something quite fascinating! Imagine taking candies out of several boxes placed vertically against each other so tightly packed nothing fits anymore because each box contains ten pieces perfectly arranged inside it without anything extra leftover space anywhere else outside them.. And now imagine doing this action again countless times...
