Specifically, split both inner sums according to whether they involve consecutive integers (\\( j = k + 1 \\)) or differing ones (\\( j > k \\)). By doing so, you decompose the complex single summation into simpler parts that more directly relate to known properties of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), namely those associated with power functions like squared and cubic denominators found in harmonic progressions related to Ap\u00e9ry's constant but here modified slightly for powers less than four._SORT_THESE INTO TWO GROUPS: ONE FOR SUMMATION WITH CONTIGUOUS INTEGERS AND ANOTHER FOR DIFFERENT VALUES OF J AND K_\\n   * Summation Group I contains pairs where \\( j = k + 1 \\): Here, observe that if \\( y = j \\) and \\( z = k \\), then \\( j = k + 1 \\Rightarrow z = k \\). Thus rewrite the pair as \\((z, z+1)\\) showing dependencies clearly through variable substitution making sure no index conflicts arise during simplification.\\n    \\[ \\sum_{j = 1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(j + k)^{3}} \\] Becomes \\[\\begin{aligned} &\\phantom{{}=}\\left( \\sum_{z=1}^{\\infty} \\right) +\\left", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Following your tip about splitting the sum regarding adjacent terms (where \\( j = k + 1 \\)), let\u2019s denote them separately \u2013 what would the expression look like after applying proper adjustments without losing track of which term corresponds to which part within the whole range?", "subanswer": {"text": "One possible arrangement could separate the cases where 'y' starts at zero since any positive integer plus its successor yields unique distinct indexes: \\\\[\\\\text{(i)} \\\\quad S_1(\\\\substack{0\\\\rightarrow2}) =\\; &\\\\frac{1}{1^3}+\\\\frac{1}{(1+2)^3}+\\\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\\\frac{1}{(2+3)^3}+\\cdots+\\\\frac{1}{(n-1)^3}+\\\\frac{1}{(n-(n-1)+1)^3}+\\\\frac{1}{n^3}\\\\]\\nThis accounts for starting from n = 1 upwards while ensuring continuity across successive indexed items ('j', now renamed 'y').
