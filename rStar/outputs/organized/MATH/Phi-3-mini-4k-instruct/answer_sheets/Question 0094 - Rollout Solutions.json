Angle BAD is divided into thirds and similarly, angle CDA is also dividedinto thirds. Labeling their respective angles as follows:\\\\[\\angle BAE = y,\\quad \\angle DEA = z.\\]Question: At what degree measure do lines AF and BE intersect? To solve this problem, we need to find the measures of the smaller segments created by dividing the larger angles bisected earlier. Since both $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CDA$ represent straight angles ($180^\\circ$), they are being split equally among themselves when divided thrice. Therefore, if $\\angle BAD$ equals $180^\\circ$, then its parts would all measure $180^\\circ / 3 = 60^\\circ$. Similarly, since $\\angle CDA = 180^\\circ$, after division it becomes four equidistant sections worth $(180^\\circ / 3)$ degrees apiece or $60^\\circ$. Now let\u2019s look at how those individual pieces add up around vertexes 'A' and 'D'. Starting off near 'A', notice that triangles 'BAE' and 'DEA' combine to give us a half turn\u2014or another word, a complete circle containing only part of our quads sides \u2018BD\u2019 &\u2018AC\u2019.' Consequently,\u2019BE + EF + FA = 180\u00b0.\u2019 Next consider similar relations happening about adjacent vertex 'D': We know '\\('DF + CE + ED = 180\u00b0.''

Condition 1:  Quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled clockwise starting from top left corner \\nis drawn. Angle BAD is divided into thirds and similarly, angle CDA is also dividedinto thirds. Labeling their respective angles as follows:\\\\[\\angle BAE = y,\\quad \\angle DEA = z.\\]Question: At what degree measure do lines AF and BE intersect? To solve this problem, we need to find the measures of the smaller segments created by dividing the larger angles bisected earlier. Since both $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CDA$ represent straight angles ($180^\\circ$), they are being split equally among themselves when divided thrice. Therefore, if $\\angle BAD$ equals $180^\\circ$, then its parts would all measure $180^\\circ / 3 = 60^\\circ$. Similarly, since $\\angle CDA = 180^\\circ$, after division it becomes four equidistant sections worth $(180^\\circ / 3)$ degrees apiece or $60^\\circ$. Now let\u2019s look at how those individual pieces add up around vertexes 'A' and 'D'. Starting off near 'A', notice that triangles 'BAE' and 'DEA' combine to give us a half turn\u2014or another word, a complete circle containing only part of our quads sides \u2018BD\u2019 &\u2018AC\u2019.'
