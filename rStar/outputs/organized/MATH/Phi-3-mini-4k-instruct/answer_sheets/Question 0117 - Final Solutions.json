Condition 1:  Find $x$ when equation given here holds true : $\\sqrt{3x-5} = 2$. \\nQuestion:What set of solutions exists for 'x' based upon above statement?. To solve for $x$, we start by isolating the variable underneath the square root on one side of the equation. We do this by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root. Remembering our rules about exponents tells us $(a^{m})^{n} = a^{(m*n)}$ meaning if we raise something like $c^{-d}$ or ${c}^{k}^{-l}$ then they become ${c}^{(k * (-l))}$. So applying those laws gives $$ (\\sqrt {3x-5})^2 = 2^2$$which simplifies down to $$\\begin{align*} &  3x-5 = 4\\\\ &\\Rightarrow ~~~~ 3x = 9\\\\&\\Rightarrow ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ x = 3 \\end{align*} $$Since we know now that **only** four answers exist because only integers were asked for , but I get more than expected .
