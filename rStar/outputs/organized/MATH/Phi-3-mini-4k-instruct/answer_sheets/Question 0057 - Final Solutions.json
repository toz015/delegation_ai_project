To simplify $|(1-i)^8|$, we first need to express $1-i$ in polar form. Recall that a complex number $z=a+bi$ can be written as $r(\\cos\\theta+\\sin\\theta i)$, where $r$ is the magnitude (or modulus) of $z$, and $\\theta$ is the argument (or angle) of $z$. For our complex number, $r=\\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}=\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\theta=\\arctan(-1/1)=\\arctan(-1)=\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{4}=-\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ (since both real and imaginary parts are negative). Thus, $1-i=\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\cos\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)+\\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)i\\right)$. By De Moivre\u2019s theorem, $[(1-i)]^{8}=\\left[r(\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta)\\right]^{8}=r^{8}(\\cos(8\\theta)+i\\sin(8\\theta))", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "What is $|\\,(1-i)^8\\,|$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Using Euler's formula, which states that $\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta=e^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta}$, we substitute the values obtained earlier back into the expression.
