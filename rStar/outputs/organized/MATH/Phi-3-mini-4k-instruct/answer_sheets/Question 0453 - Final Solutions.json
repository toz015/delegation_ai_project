Condition 3: Both grades share exactly 18 seats among their respective councilors equally distributed across them.Question: Assuming all else stays constant how many additional members would need to join either classroom before we could divide our councils proportionally again? I got wrong answers when solving my own problem.. Answer Correct Solution First find ratio $$\\frac {TotalStudents} {{Ratioofstudents}}$$ Ratio of Students $$=\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\frac {T7}{\\text R}\\\\ \\frac {T8}{\\text R }\\end{bmatrix}=\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\frac {520}{R}\\\\ \\frac {650}{R }\\end{bmatrix}\\right]$$ Where **T** stands Total Population & ***R*** represents its corresponding Grade Now Equation becomes : \\[Fractional\\;ratio =\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\frac {520}{R}\\\\\\frac {650}{R }\\end{matrix}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\frac {\\frac {520}{R}}{\\frac {650}{R}}\\end{matrix}\\right]\\Rightarrow Frac\\{T7, T8\\} = \\frac {520}{650}= \\frac {4}{5}$$Now Find New Combined Populations Let current populations differ By some amount lets call it *P* Lets say new combined population now looks like [\\begin{array}{ccc|cc}1&0&\\color{red}{P}&520+\\color{blue}{P}&\\\\0&1&\\color{green}{Q}&650-\\color{purple}{Q}\\end{array}] Solve Like So \\[\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 && P \\\\0 & 1 && Q\\end{pmatrix}*\\begin{pmatrix}M_1 & M_2 & || & E_{mgmt}|| & V_{total}&&V_{current}======>NewValues============================= \\\\\\hline Interpgrate={Same \\;Value}-InterGrated\\,Error=------------&=\\\\\\hline Error={\\frac{(TargetVal-(CurrentVal)+IntGradePop", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "To keep things simple let's assume intergrade error term (IGE)=0 In which case if following equations hold true...
