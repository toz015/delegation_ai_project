It appears my previous responses were cut off at critical junctures where they should continue logically based on conventional mathematics problem solving techniques including substitution methods specific to optimization problems often encountered within algebraic contexts\u2014essential tools especially relevant now while addressing 'minimum values,' implying potential use case scenarios requiring differentiation strategies alongside initial condition derivation possibly engaging indirect relationships foundational amongst quadratic forms root systems etc..

Answer is yes. This statement holds true because if every instance of variable \u2018c\u2019 gets replaced by its equivalent term (i.e., '2b'), our initial equation remains unchanged since algebraic expressions maintain equivalence irrespective of how they are manipulated provided those terms don't interfere amongst themselves.
