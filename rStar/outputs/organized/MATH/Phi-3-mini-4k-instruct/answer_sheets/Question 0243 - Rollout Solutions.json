If one leg of a right triangle measures 1 unit and another leg measures 3 units, according to Pythagoras\u2019 theorem, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) represents the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) represent the legs of the triangle respectively. Here it would look something like \\(\\text{{leg}}_1^2 + \\text{{leg}}_2^2 = \\text{{hypotenuse}}^2\\). Given \\(\\text{{leg}}_1 = 1\\) unit (\\(\\Rightarrow 1^2\\)) and \\[\\text{{leg}}_2 = 3\\] unites (\\[\\Rightarrow 3^2 \\]), plugging them back into the equation yields \\[1 + 9 = \\text{{hypotenuse}}^2,\\]which simplifies further to \\[\\text{{hypotenuse}}^2 = 10.\\]Finally taking square root of both sides results \\[\\text{{hypotenuse}} = \\sqrt{10}\\].
