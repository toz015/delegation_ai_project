Condition 1:  The scenario involves a rectangular field measuring 300 feet in width and 400 feet in length. Condition 2: Two individuals, Jim and Martha, start from the same diagonal corner. Jim chooses to move directly through the center of the field via a straight path while Martha opts to take turns around both sides. Condition 3: Upon reaching their destination simultaneously without exiting the edges, we need to determine how much further distance did Jim cover compared to Martha during his journey inside the field boundaries. Question: By exactly how many fewer footsteps was Jim able to traverse when considering he walked only halfway toward either edge instead of covering the entirety? To solve this problem, let us consider some key geometric principles related to rectangles. When moving diagonally, like Jim doing, or traversing the whole lengths plus widths\u2014like Martha would do\u2014the shortest path taken covers the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle formed by the side lengths of the rectangle. We use Pythagoras\u2019 theorem here since our shape forms a right angle \u2013 \\(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\\) where 'c' represents the longest side ('hypotenuse'), and 'a' & 'b' represent the shorter sides. Here, c equals \\(\\sqrt{(400)^2+(300)^2} \\approx  500 \\) ft . Hence , if Jim were to go full length ways then he had covered approximately 500ft but going just halfways means travelling about ~250 feet total hence subtracting him travel distances : \\[~250-(300+\\frac{1}{2}(400))=\\frac{1}{2}(500)-350 \\implies -\\frac{50}{2}=-\\frac{50}{2}-(-150)=-25=-125\\] Therefore, given all above calculations based upon provided dimensions, Bob managed to save himself precisely fifteen hundredths (-0.15 meters ) more steps because even though theoretically he needed fifty extra minutes yet practically saved them due oversight thus making calculation relevant despite slight negativity indicating reduced efforts made versus expected results under ideal circumstance assumption.
