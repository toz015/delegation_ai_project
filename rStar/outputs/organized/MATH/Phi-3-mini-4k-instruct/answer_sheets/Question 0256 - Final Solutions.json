Now our equation becomes \\[[\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{8}{7}] * [\\frac{20}{12}].\\] Condition 3: To further reduce complexity, multiply fractions directly without changing order or applying rules like cross-multiplication here because all terms share common factors among numerators and denominators respectively.
