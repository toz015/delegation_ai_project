By nature of how you defined each iteration - starting with one specific real number (\\(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\)), iterating through adding reciprocal terms progressively forms something known in mathematics called 'continued fractions.' These allow for expressions like \\(\\sqrt{2} = 1 +\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{2}}\\) etc., but not directly applicable here because cubic roots don\u2019t yield rational results until reached into extremely high precision computations beyond standard calculations typically done manually/visually.
