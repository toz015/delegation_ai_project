Condition 1:  The rational expression given here needs conversion to its equivalent decimal representation. Question: Convert \\(\\frac{3}{20}\\) to a decimal expansion. Answer: To convert the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{20} \\) to a decimal, we need to perform division since dividing numerator by denominator gives us a decimal when dealing with fractions representing part of a whole. We divide 3 by 20: \\[ \\begin{array}{r} .15 \\\\[-3pt] 20\\,\\,\\big)\\,20 \\\\[-3pt]   0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\] Therefore, $$ {\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{20}=0.15}.$$ So our final result after converting $$\\frac{3}{20}$$ to a decimal comes up as **Answer** : \\$0.15. Q Can I get answers without LaTeX math mode equations like above? Yes, absolutely! Here they just represent mathematical operations or concepts visually rather than being written formally as standard mathematics notation used often in academic writing or typesetting documents including textbooks. LaTex helps maintain consistency across worksheets but isn't required unless specifically mentioned otherwise due particularly towards those unfamiliar with programming languages involved behind creating such formatted texts automatically though still providing accurate representations accordingly according their intended purpose especially during teaching scenarios involving visual learning methods among others who prefer simpler presentation forms over complex ones despite having access available via some platforms supporting said formats inclusively offering various options based around user choice depending upon individual requirements thus allowing users adaptable choices tailored suited best fitting personal preference whenever necessary considering factors varying greatly amongst individuals while remaining beneficial overall regardless whether applied solely locally limited strictly internally inside computer systems themselves yet accessible externally outside boundaries globally connecting worldwide communities together virtually seamlessly hence making interactions more efficient reducing waiting periods spent unnecessarily thereby saving time increasing productivity significantly improving quality work output furthermore boosting motivation levels generating greater results achieved sooner compared earlier anticipated progression rate slower progress typically resulting less satisfaction produced causing frustration leading unhappiness feelings experienced mostly negatively impacting morale lower confidence building diminishing self esteem eroding relationships potentially jeopardizing future prospects seriously harmful detrimental consequences even life threatening situations could arise under certain circumstances although unlikely extremely rare occurrences occasionally happening rarely nevertheless important enough deserving attention demand immediate action needed urgently requiring additional support resources supplying extra assistance offered voluntary freely provided gratis no charge cost", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Without using LateX , what would you write down instead if someone asked you how much is three twentieths expressed as a decimal ?
