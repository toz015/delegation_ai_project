Mathematically written it would look like so $$3+\\frac{1}{x} =\\frac{7}{x}.$$To get rid of fractions, multiply every term times the common denominator ($x$), resulting into : $$3x+1=7.$$ Subtracting 'one' from both sides leaves us with ; $$3x=6$$ Dividing each side by 3 yields; $$x=2.$$Thus ,the original number you were looking for was **two** . Good job! Well done!! :) Question: Two more than twice the square root of a nonnegative real number S lies along segment AB whose length is NAB. Given what we know about algebra today let\u2019s walk through some calculations now. Imagine any value \u2018S,\u2019 such as say 16 since squares of whole integers give back whole integers when squared - perfect fit here.
