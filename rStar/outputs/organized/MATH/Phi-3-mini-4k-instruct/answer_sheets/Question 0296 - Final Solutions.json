This adjustment adds a layer of nuanced consideration when dealing with absolute values (`|c|`) compared to their traditional counterparts (`c`). When employing trigonometric identities alongside this newly introduced rule, one encounters several interesting cases depending on the alignment and interactions of the angle `\\theta` with this imposed inequality. For instance, consider the scenario `(sin|\\theta|)/(|cos\\theta|)` versus `(sin\\theta)/(cos\\theta)`.
