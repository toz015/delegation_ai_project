So ADBC forms part of a rhombus ABCD whose diagonals intersect at right angles bisecting its vertex angles. Thus AC&DB divide the quadrilateral's interior angle sum of 360\u00b0 equally among their intersection vertices whereby they individually split off half those degrees leaving them acute which explains why triangle DBX formed below isn't obtuse since none of its internal angles exceed 45\u00b0 or fall short of less than zero while every other corresponding non-intersecting diagonal cuts through some pair of parallel lines thus creating alternate exterior angles equalling complementary ones so therefore either triangles such as DCY & XBY remain similarly angled thereby ensuring no consecutive external angles surpass straight line values but rather maintain supplementary status making up full turns around shared centers like E within polygons sharing borders lending themselves nicely towards circularity if desired herein lies our clue regarding locating exact placements relative orientations amongst shapes described above ultimately leading toward identifying how much space remains unoccupied inside said figure once determined precisely enough just before proceedings initiate upon actually computing quantities being sought after namely area sums totaled across various regions forming intricate patterns interspaced throughout otherwise mundane layout plans designed primarily via straightforward geometric approaches commonly employed during early childhood education stages typically found lacking appropriate guidance necessitating adult supervision until students reach more advanced levels capable handling complex problem solving skills required involving calculus techniques beyond elementary school curricula standards currently failing miserably fail achieving sufficient competency rates despite considerable investment resources allocated accordingly often resulting dire consequences arising whenever individuals attempt self directed attempts unaided further exacerbating situation only worsening progressively over time consequently rendering majority unable successfully navigate future challenges encountered subsequent years unless drastic improvements implemented expeditiously forthwith hopefully prevent permanent damage done irreversibly forevermore especially critical nowadays technological advancements introducing ever new variables constantly changing landscape significantly altering educational paradigms requiring constant adaptation adjustments modifications revisions updates enhancements refinements optimizations reforms reformulations reconstructions revolutionize teaching methods traditional practices rapidly transforming modernization trends dominated innovation mindset driving whole process forward speedily accelerating pace far faster learning curve slop", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "By using properties of parallelograms (since ABCD shares a common side AD): Let's first consider that ABCD was transformed into APQR under certain conditions without loss of general shape information about it yet keeping important attributes intact.
