Condition 2: One vertex of this triangle is marked A while another called C is given directly opposite its diagonal AM . An additional marking labeled 'D', denotes some spot along side AM , satisfying two criteria : \\n1.) Altitude distance AD equals ten units or more precisely twelve tenths if desired ;   \\n2.) Angle BCD forms triple the amount found inside beta since delta represents angle BAC above. Based on these considerations only,\\nQuestion: Calculate how long would side AC measure in terms of absolute integers without decimals ?
