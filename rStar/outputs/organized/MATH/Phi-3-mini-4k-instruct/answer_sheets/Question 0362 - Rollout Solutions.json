Let me continue answering Question 5 for you now. To solve the problem assuming replacement\u2014meaning once someone gets elected, they return back onto the roster so everyone still has an equal opportunity again\u2014we use basic concepts from probability regarding combined independent events. In simpler terms, think about flipping a coin twice. Regardless of whether heads comes up or tails turns face down, the next throw behaves identically. Therefore, calculating separately allows combining them effortlessly later. Here, replacing means similar thinking applies but translated differently. After applying appropriate formulas & simplifying steps mentioned beforehand, we land at the conclusion expressed through fractions representing various probabilistic aspects associated with running campaigns.
