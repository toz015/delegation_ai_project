If triangles ABC and ADC had congruent heights when extended upwards from BC and DC respectively (considering lines drawn vertically through vertices opposite each other), yet different bases, achieving equality requires additional constraints not specified here. Thus, focusing solely on our current information leads us away from needing exact dimensions.
