Following it sequentially yields :\nStep One: Apply Distributive Property (Rule C says Multiplication Should Take Precedence Over Addition Or Subtraction Inside Brackets ) => Calculate separately both sides multiplying respective elements under corresponding Coefficients ie multiply every element present under bracket respectively:- On Left Side [ $4*(3r^3)+4*5r-4*6$ ]=> $=12r^3+20r-24$ ;On Right side[ $-6 * (2r^3)-6*(r^2)+6*4r$] => $[=-12r^3-6r^2+24r]$ Now combine", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
