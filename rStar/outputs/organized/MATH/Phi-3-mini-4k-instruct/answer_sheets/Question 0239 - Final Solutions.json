of three parallelograms ABCDE and FGHIJ, one needs to focus on obtaining maximum rectangle aspect ratio combinations `(WxH)` both sets simultaneously, i.e., `[Max(|AB| x |EF|)] / [Min(|AE| x |FG|)]`. Given `|AB| = sqrt(a\u00b2+b\u00b2)`, it follows our aim becomes finding `minimum [(a\u00b2+b\u00b2)*(c\u00b2+d\u00b2)]/(Ac\u00d7Ad)`.
