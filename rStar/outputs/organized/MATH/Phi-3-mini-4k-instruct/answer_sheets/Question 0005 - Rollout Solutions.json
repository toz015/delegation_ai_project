Hint 1 tells us each side of the equilateral triangle within the hexagon measures 7 inches. To get the full perimeter of the hexagon, we need to consider how it relates to the single triangle mentioned earlier - hint 2 indicates we do just that. As such, multiplying the value calculated via Hint 1 i.e., 7 inches \u2013 correspondingly representing the length of every singular edge comprising the said polygonic figure \u2013 yields... Multiply them together!.. indeed.
