For a fraction to be positive, either both the numerator and denominator need to be positive, or both need to be negative. However, since our numerator is already set as 1 (which is always positive), it suffices to focus on when the denominator $x-5$ is also positive. Thus, we solve the inequality $x - 5 > 0$, yielding $x > 5$. Hence, any value strictly larger than 5 satisfies the original inequality; so our solution in interval notation would simply be $(5,\\infty)$, meaning all real numbers greater than 5 but not including itself satisfy this condition due to division by zero being undefined. There may appear to be no error here\u2014this reasoning aligns perfectly well within established mathematical principles governing rational expressions\u2019 behavior based upon variable inputs spanning different numerical intervals relative to critical constant terms influencing sign transitions amongst constituent components comprising such functions under consideration.
