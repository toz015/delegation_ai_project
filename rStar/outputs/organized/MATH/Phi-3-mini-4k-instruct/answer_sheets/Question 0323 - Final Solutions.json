chord extensions formed as described overlap each other, first recognize several underlying assumptions and constraints required for precise computation:\n\n1. **Discrete Locations** - Given finite locations (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`) implies discrete configurations rather than continuous variables affecting crossing pathways. Thus traditional measure theories might apply better suited instead of pure probabilistic approaches unless intervals smaller than one pixel size need consideration too broadly distributed yet similar objects causing actual impact cases unlikely except highly controlled settings leading computational models into heavy approximations otherwise rendering results less relevant / reliable. However, it does allow us assuming well behaved setups prevent collision even though rare instances happen rarely enough dismiss practical concerns altogether simplifying matters greatly allowing neglect towards tiny odd chance event counting individually impossible thanks vast selection pool reducing overall expected frequencies making occurrence extremely low nearly ignored providing solid basis eliminating further detailed discussions unnecessary clarifications maintain focus solely address main aspect avoiding excess detail potentially muddling clear understanding essential present topic relevancy importance holds primary purpose supporting argument strengthening persuasion appealing reader attention engagement promoting informed dialogue fostering constructive progress encouragement collaborative effort toward achieving shared goal collectively pursuing common aspiration adv", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
