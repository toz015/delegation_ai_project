We start by assigning probabilities based on the given constraints. Let $p$ represent the probability of landing on face $F$. According to the problem, the probability of landing on the opposite face ($O_F$) is then also $p$. Since those are the only opposites affected differently, they account for more than half but less than or equal to twice the normal distribution since their combined probabilities exceed 1 when added together due to being larger than $1/6$. Therefore, we get:$$ p + p > 1 $$which simplifies to $$ 2p > 1 $$or equivalently $$ p > \\frac{1}{2} $$Given the total probability must add up to 1 across all sides, the rest four faces share equally divided leftover probability.$$ q + q + q + q = 1 - 2p $$Simplifying yields $$ 4q = 1 - 2p $$Now substituting back our expression for $p$:$$ 4q = 1 - 2(\\frac{1}{2}) = 0 $$From here, no side can possibly show because even though none shows specifically 'six', five possibilities exist excluding the already calculated case showing either 'one' or 'two'.
