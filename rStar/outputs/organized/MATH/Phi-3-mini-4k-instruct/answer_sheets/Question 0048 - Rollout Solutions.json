Specifically, when multiplying powers with the same base but different exponents, you add the exponents together; conversely, dividing them involves subtraction. Moreover, any nonzero real number raised to the power zero equals one. Now, since both sides of the provided equality contain bases four ($4$ being evenly distributed among terms involving squares such as sixteen ($4^2$), eight($4^{3/2}$)), it might prove beneficial applying logarithm rules here before further proceedings begin. However another useful approach could lie within converting each side into geometric series whose ratio equates to either half ('$\\tfrac{1}{2}'$) due to division operation required during simplification process thereby making calculations much simpler instead requiring extensive algebraic manipulations usually encountered otherwise! Please note no need resort 'log functions', just basic algebra suffices - remember how quickly those pesky square roots disappear once transformed correctly .
