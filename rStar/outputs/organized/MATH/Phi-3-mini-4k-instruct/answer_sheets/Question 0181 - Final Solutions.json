applying operations like squaring, taking even powers, adding results, multiplying outcomes, and substituting numerical values. Let me clarify each operation along with examples to help illustrate the proper approach:\n\n**Operation 1 - Squaring Variables:**\nWhen dealing with squares ($X^2$), it involves raising a variable X to the second power. For instance, if $X=3$, then $X^2=3^2=9$. Keep substitution outside the brackets unless necessary\u2014only change the value inside once done calculating the initial term. Example: Given $a^2$: replace '$a$' first before squaring.\n\nExample calculation: $a^2$; replacing a with x (common practice): $x^2$ implies computing $(\\text{value} * x)*x$. Remember, multiplication happens last according to order precedence (*before* addition)! Thus, evaluate quadratic forms differently than simple products ($\\text{num}^2$). Do NOT multiply directly into resulting cubic polynomial parts later \u2013 treat squared segments individually throughout computation stages prior to aggregation (+/- subtraction).\n\nImportant", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 12}]
