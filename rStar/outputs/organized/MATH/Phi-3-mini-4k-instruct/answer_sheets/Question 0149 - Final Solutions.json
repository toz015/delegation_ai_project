Essentially, finding out the smallest shared base value k= least common multiplier (LCM) that fits {2k-1 ,  3k-1 ,   4k-1} could imply some unique property linked possibly to certain sequences known elsewhere mathematics called Mersenne Numbers (primes formulated as 2^p\u22121) though traditionally different patterns apply .
