From here Y could equal either zero or some constant value c. If y was not zero I believe you would get more equations...so let assume it equals zero so as our function looks like this : KQ'(X)+C. Now looking back up remember C = f(0)/f'(0)? Plugging into functions using roots give me .8c ..this leads directly to knowing my root/constant value since I am able to plug those specific things straight into FUNCTIONS! Thus giving me one equation..and another upon doing similar process twice again yielding three variables solving them yields [K=-3],[Y]=0,[F]=.5 To simplify even further....since i don't actually need any constants besides F simply substituting known pieces lets say X->1 now because everything else resolves itself leaving just variable B; same thing happens below but changing around terms accordingly.....hence rewriting your problem above based off info thus acquired allows simplifying quite nicely once combined together leading to conclusion !!!

Specifically, according to the Remainder Theorem, if a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by a linear factor $(x - r)$, then the remainder is $P(r)$.\nWe are told that $P(x)$ leaves no remainder when divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4)$ and remains unchanged ($2R(x)$ times something equivalent to original quotient plus some unknown addend) when divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3)$. These conditions lead to several important conclusions regarding the behavior of $P(x)$ near certain critical values: namely, $x = 1$, $x = 2$, and $x = 3$. Moreover, note that since $P(x)$ doesn\u2019t change form over particular intervals, it implies continuity within each interval defined separately due to absence of divisions resulting in nonzero limits approaching boundaries.
