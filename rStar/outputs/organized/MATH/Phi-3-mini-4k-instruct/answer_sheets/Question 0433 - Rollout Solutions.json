So no, not entirely true (i.e., incorrect); thus correct choice must be 'False'. Answer True because if any base were not included among the set of allowable bases ($b$), such common fraction would have been impossible to express precisely within our numeral system; hence every possible denominator includes at least those particular values allowed for its conversion into a finite representation upon division.
