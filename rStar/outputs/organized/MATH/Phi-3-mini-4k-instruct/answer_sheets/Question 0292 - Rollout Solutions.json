Similarly applying same logic throughout till reaching `x_5`: `[(4-3)+(-2)]=[1]`. Observe similar patterns continuously following thus yields series like `{..., [-2],[-1],[0],[1]} => {-2,-1,0,1}` etc., leading us directly into computing required expressions easily via simple arithmetic operations considering just four first digits recurrences within the specified range (`x_1` through `x_4`).
