However, if we interpret this based on your intent:\n\nTo find out how many pencils Faye would have in each group when she divides all the pencils evenly into 14 groups, assuming she has enough pencils so that no grouping is leftover, you'd divide the total number of pencils (which isn't specified here) by 14.\n\nWithout the actual total number of pencils, I can only state the general process:\n\nTotal number of pencils / 14 groups = Number of pencils per group\n\nFor example, if she had 154 pencils,\n\n154 / 14 = 11 pencils per group.\n\nSo, if Faye divided her pencils evenly among 14 groups, each group would contain 11 pencils, provided she had exactly 154 pencils.
