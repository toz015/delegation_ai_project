Given the constraints of the provided data and assuming the aim is to understand whether the number of books purchased exceeds the minimum required to reach his current count of 116 books when factoring in an unknown but assumed non-zero number sold, logically deducing from the direct transactions described (buying 38 books) suggests he indeed bought more books overall than could be attributed to a scenario where he started at zero books and reached 116 solely via purchasing actions, disregarding any specific details on sales volume without contradicting the final book count of 116. Thus, under interpretation focusing strictly on the transactions listed (\"bought\" and \"now has\") and applying basic mathematical operations to account for these steps, one may argue that Paul inherently 'bought' more books conceptually compared to a null sale condition, leading to his possession of 116 books\u2014this perspective acknowledges an oversimplification inherent due to lack of explicit detail regarding exact sales amounts.
