Initially, Olivia must have had 29 (remaining) plus whatever amount she spent at the supermarket. To find out how much she spent, we need to know her starting amount which isn't provided.

As formulated, only the remaining is provided, which would suggest a need for another piece of information to calculate the spent amount. Therefore, without additional context like starting balance or exact change before spending, one cannot accurately calculate what Olivia spent.\n\nHowever, assuming an oversight and aiming for a solution based solely on the concept applied within previous similar scenarios (where a start and end amount were given, leading to calculating change), let's consider an example clarification:\n\nSuppose Olivia started with an unknown but known value X dollars and ended with $29.
