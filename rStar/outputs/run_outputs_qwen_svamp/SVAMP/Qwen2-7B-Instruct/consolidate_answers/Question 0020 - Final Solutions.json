Based on this interpretation, since he went from making or having 121 cakes to potentially ending up with 186 cakes after buying more, it implies the initial sale (not mentioned) was part of reaching or adjusting the final count. However, considering only actions provided:\n\n- Baker initially had 121 cakes.\n- Sold 105 cakes, leaving him with \\(121 - 105 = 16\\) cakes.\n- Bought 170 additional cakes, resulting in \\(16 + 170 = 186\\) cakes.\n\nIn terms of sales directly mentioned: The baker sold **1", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many cakes did baker end up with?", "subanswer": {"text": "The baker started with 121 cakes, sold some and then bought 170 new ones.
