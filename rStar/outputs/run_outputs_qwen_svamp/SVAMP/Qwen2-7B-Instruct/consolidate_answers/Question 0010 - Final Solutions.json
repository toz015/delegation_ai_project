Since 6 storks joined but no storks left (assuming none left), there are now 11 birds and 6 storks, meaning there are 6 - 11 = -5 fewer storks than birds, indicating there are not more storks than birds since we ended up with more birds. However, if you meant 'how many more birds than storks', then it would be 11 - 6 = 5 more birds than storks. The answer depends on whether you're asking about more storks or more birds relative to each other; based on your options provided, assuming you want to find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, the answer is 5.", "value": 0.25}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 birds were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them.
