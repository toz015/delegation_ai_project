Yesterday, 45 people visited the Buckingham Palace. We're looking at the past 85 days without including yesterday. So we subtract one day from the count which makes it 84 days. We assume each of those days had exactly 45 visitors for simplicity. Thus, 84 days multiplied by 45 visitors per day equals 3780 visitors over the 84 days. However, this includes the known 45 visitors from yesterday, so we remove them: 3780 minus 45 is 3735 visitors.
