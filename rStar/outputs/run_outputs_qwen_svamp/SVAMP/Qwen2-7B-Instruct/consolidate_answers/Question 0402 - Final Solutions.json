Let me solve this problem again without relying on the hint:\n\nTo find out how much money the ring toss game made per day over these 30 days, you need to first subtract the earnings from the other game from the total earnings. This leaves you only with the earnings from the ring toss game. \n\nSo we start with the total earnings of all games which was 420 dollars and add the earnings from the other game, which amounts to 22 dollars. That sums up to:\n\nTotal earnings from both games: 420 + 22 = 442 dollars\n\nNow divide this sum by the number of days (30):\n\nEarnings per day from the ring toss game = Total earnings / Number of days = 442 / 30 \u2248 14.73\n\nTherefore, the ring toss game made approximately $14.73 per day.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day.
