Since no new roses were mentioned being added other than what was already in the vase, Jessica must have cut an additional number of roses equal to the difference between the final and initial counts of roses. However, since the question specifies that Jessica cut more roses and orchids without specifying if any were removed, assuming an increase or not changing the count could mean Jessica didn't actually add new roses when considering only the information provided (though common context suggests there might be an oversight or misinterpretation). Given the constraints imposed within the problem statement, the question seems to imply that no new roses were added; thus, Jessica cut 15 - 17 = -2 roses, implying she should logically have considered removing 2 roses from the vase based on the information presented. But in practical terms, if she started with 15 roses, she would need to either remove 2 or not touch the existing roses to ensure the vase count remains unchanged without adding any. Since the original state is given as having 15 roses, the intended interpretation might be questioning how many more roses were needed to reach the final count rather than how many were cut, as cuts typically reduce quantity. If interpreting 'cut' as required to reach the stated end result, it indicates she would have needed to add 17 - 15 = 2 more roses to achieve the specified outcome, acknowledging a potential oversight in the clarity of the question regarding actions taken specifically with roses. Without explicit clarification on whether roses were physically removed from the vase or simply not counted towards adding flowers, this interpretation is speculative. Under standard understanding, since the scenario doesn\u2019t explicitly convey removal and focuses instead on a net addition of items, it implies no physical cutting took place based solely on the numbers given. The answer to the question posed directly, however, considering the straightforward nature of the question and its typical interpretation in such scenarios, should align with the goal of understanding change in rose count in the vase: Since the vase count increased from 15 to 17 roses, and assuming nothing else changed (which isn\u2019t clarified), Jessica effectively \u2018added\u2019 2 more roses to adjust the described scenario's end state\u2014understanding this primarily as conceptual accounting rather than actual action.
