After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 cards in total now, implying she kept 415 - (number of baseball cards) Ace cards.

As the exact number of baseball cards isn't specified, we'll proceed under the assumption that she kept all baseball cards and subtract from the total: Since she started with 309 baseball cards, if none were given away, she should still have those. This doesn't align with the information provided, indicating an error in assumptions. Let's correct our approach: The difference between the total card count before and after giving some to Jeff directly corresponds to the number of cards given away or kept, which is not directly used here but suggests she could've given away any combination of the total 765 cards minus the final count of 415. Assuming no mistake in understanding, however, we should calculate based on what we're given rather than make unwarranted deductions. Given the confusion might stem from misinterpretation or lack of data, let us assume she has equally distributed the change across types due to lack of specifics. Thus, we will take the average reduction considering she had both types of cards and ended up with 415 total. This would suggest she has kept roughly half of each type since she started with 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. Half of each type would then be (309+356)/2=332.5, rounding down because you cannot have half a card, Nell has approximately 332 cards of one type and 333 of the other, implying the slight discrepancy likely comes from rounding.
