The mailman has to give out 14 pieces of junk mail across all houses in a block. Since he gives 2 pieces to each house, we can determine how many houses there are in the block by dividing the total amount of junk mail by the amount given per house:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of houses} = \\frac{\\text{Total junk mail}}{\\text{Junk mail per house}} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\]\n\nThis means there are 7 houses in the block. However, if you're asking how many junk mails the mailman gives per house based solely on what was provided (\"A mailman gives 2 junk mails to each house\"), then without further context or additional information about the specific distribution pattern within blocks (e.g., uniform distribution), we rely only on this rule.\n\nSince it's stated that \"the mailman gives 2 junk mails to each house\" without any indication of variation, the correct interpretation based on the initial statement alone is that the mailman gives \\(2\\) junk mails per house. \n\nTherefore,\n\nThe answer is: \\(2\\).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many houses are there in a block?", "subanswer": {"text": "Given the initial conditions and your clarification, we deduced correctly that with 14 pieces of junk mail distributed evenly among all houses and each house receiving 2 pieces, there must be \\(7\\) houses in a block.
