However, since you've already provided the information about revenue from sales, we can deduce:\n\n- Revenue per jersey: $210\n- Revenue per t-shirt: $240\n\nTherefore, a t-shirt costs $240 - $210 = $30 more than a jersey.\n\nThe answer is: $30.", "value": 0.6875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt.
