Hence, he made 134 pastries - 140 cakes = -6 (which indicates he would need an additional 6 cakes to match the pastries made). But the correct way to compare is to say he made 134 pastries - 140 cakes = -6, meaning he actually needs 6 more cakes to match the number of pastries he made. However, if looking for surplus of pastries over cakes instead, the calculation should be based directly off the total made versus sold, not considering any hypothetical additional production. Since cakes sold exceeds made, it should be calculated as made pastries minus sold cakes directly, indicating an excess of pastries over the cakes sold but not produced. Given the context, the correct interpretation is the difference between the quantity made and sold\u2014thus, 134 pastries minus 140 cakes equals -6, showing he ended up needing 6 additional cakes to match his pastry production; however, focusing solely on surplus pastries over sold cakes yields the insight that he had enough pastries even after selling the cakes without needing any additional cakes production. The answer is 134 pastries - 140 cakes = -6, acknowledging the surplus from production perspective, or directly interpreting the question correctly as asking about surplus relative to actual sales suggests the initial framing aimed for comparison rather than accounting imbalance, leading to clarification needed on the intended approach to measuring surplus. The essence of the query seems to seek the direct comparison between pastries made against cakes sold, thus, considering the context aiming for surplus over sold items, effectively highlighting Baker made 134 pastries surpassing the 140 cakes sold, implying he indeed had a surplus of 134 pastries compared to the cakes sold, given the numbers provided do not suggest production exceeded sale requirements beyond these specific quantities, aligning more closely to finding the disparity in consumption rather than absolute surplus under the original misinterpretation's lens. The answer is 134 pastries - 140 cakes = -6, emphasizing the comparative aspect directly linking to identifying an oversupply of pastries compared to cakes sold within the parameters defined, acknowledging the nuanced interpretation required to accurately reflect the inquiry's intent regarding surplus in relation to the specific transactions involving production and sale figures provided.
