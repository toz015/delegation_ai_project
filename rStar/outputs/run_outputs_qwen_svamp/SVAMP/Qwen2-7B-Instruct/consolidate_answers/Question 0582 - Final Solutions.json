We would assume the minimum case if interpreting '3 more' meant an extra page over no reading at all:\n- If no reading was done, then math pages = 3, but this contradicts the initial math assignment being 8 pages.\n\nGiven these complexities, let's simplify the task. From the provided facts:\n\nMath pages = Reading pages + 3\nWe're told:\nMath pages = 8\n\nSubstituting into our equation gives us:\nReading pages = Math pages - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5\n\nSo, Rachel completed 5 pages of reading and 8 pages of math.
