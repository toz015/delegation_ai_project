The person had a total of 40 saltwater animals across all aquariums. If there are 2 animals in each aquarium, we can divide the total number of animals by the number of animals per aquarium to find out how many aquariums there are. But actually you're asking how many animals are in each aquarium if he divided them equally into groups of 2 in each aquarium already. Since every aquarium has 2 animals, the answer is straightforward: there are always 2 animals in each aquarium. The answer is: 2.\n\nGreat!
