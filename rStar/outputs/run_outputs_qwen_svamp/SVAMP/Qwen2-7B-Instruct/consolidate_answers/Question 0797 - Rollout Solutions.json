However, since you only mentioned what the mailman does per house in a block, let's address just this first part.\n\nSo, if you meant 'How many pieces of junk mail does the mailman distribute in a block?' assuming the entire block consists of enough houses to receive 2 pieces each without specifying the exact number of houses:\n\\[ \\text{Junk Mails per Block} = 2 \\times (\\text{Number of Houses}) \\]\n\nWithout knowing the specific number of houses, we can't provide a numerical answer here as the question stands.
