Given that Melissa scored 21 points across several games, here's the calculation:\n\nTotal points / Number of games = Points per game\n\nSo we'll substitute 21 for 'Total points' since it doesn't specify the exact number of games she played:\n\n21 points / Number of games = 7 points/game \n\nFor this equation to hold true (meaning she indeed scored 7 points in every single game), the number of games must be evenly divisible into 21 without leaving any remainder. When you perform the division, you find:\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7\n\nSince 21 divided by 3 equals 7 with no remainder, it indicates that she played exactly 3 games and scored 7 points in each game.
