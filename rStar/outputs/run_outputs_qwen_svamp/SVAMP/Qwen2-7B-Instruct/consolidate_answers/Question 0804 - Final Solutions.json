Since the question refers to the total produced rather than just the unsold ones, we consider the total baked as the reference point.\n\nThe baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. To find how many more pastries than cakes:\n\nWe compare the total pastries to the total cakes, which is 131 pastries minus 19 cakes. \n\nSo, 131 pastries - 19 cakes = 112\n\nTherefore, the baker made 112 more pastries than cakes.\n\nThe answer is: 112.", "value": 0.5}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
