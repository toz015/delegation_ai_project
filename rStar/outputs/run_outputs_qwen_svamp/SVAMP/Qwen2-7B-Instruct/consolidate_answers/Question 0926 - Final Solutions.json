Let's denote the number of crackers he gave to each friend as 'x'. Since he divided the crackers equally among his 3 friends, we can write this action mathematically as: 3x (total crackers given away). \n\nAfter distributing the crackers evenly among his friends, Matthew was left with 17 crackers. So, if we subtract the total number of crackers given out (3x) from the initial amount (24), we get the remaining amount, which is said to be 17. We can express this relationship with the following equation: \n\\[ 24 - 3x = 17 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) will give us the number of crackers each friend received.\nFirst, simplify the equation by subtracting 17 from both sides:\n\\[ 24 - 17 = 3x \\]\n\\[ 7 = 3x \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{7}{3} \\]\n\nHowever, since crackers cannot be divided into fractions in practical scenarios, suggesting that each friend received exactly \\( \\frac{", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 8}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Matthew had 24 crackers.
