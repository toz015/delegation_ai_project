Without such details, we can't find out Dean's height accurately based only on this information provided.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Depth of water = 2 * Dean's height\n- Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron\n\nTo proceed, you'd need at least one piece of concrete numerical data (Dean's height or Ron's height) to solve for Dean's height using these relationships. Please provide additional details if available.\n\nSince no direct way to solve for Dean's height is clear from the current set of facts, I'm unable to provide a definitive numeric answer without introducing new variable values not presented here.\n\nThe answer cannot be determined based on the information provided.
