The mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. That means the frog jumped 9+3 = 12 inches more than what the mouse did. But we also know that the frog jumped 33 inches further than the grasshopper. Therefore, the distance the frog jumped can be found by adding this extra 33 inches to the original distance of 9 inches, i.e., 9 + 33 = 42 inches. However, since this is already considering the additional jump beyond the grasshopper, it doesn't account for the base jump which was equivalent to what the mouse would've jumped (i.e., the difference part). Hence, the actual jump of the frog is simply calculated by just adding the base difference (from grasshopper) plus its own additional distance over the grasshopper; so, the correct process involves understanding that the 'extra' information about the mouse helps define the base distance the frog jumps relative to the grasshopper - effectively making the calculation simpler as initially interpreted.\n\nTherefore, if the grasshopper jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, then:\n\nFrog Jump", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How far did the frog jump?", "subanswer": {"text": "The frog jumped 9 + 33 = 42 inches.", "value": 1.0}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 6}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest.
