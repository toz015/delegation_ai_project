Hence, considering practical distribution, if we aim to provide whole crackers and assume the context allows for an equal whole number distribution, the question seems to imply an idealized scenario where a fraction isn't considered.

For the purpose of providing a clear numerical answer based solely on the information provided and avoiding any fractional outcomes from the question setup, we should conclude that the total count of crackers shared under equal distribution principles resulted in each receiving 2 crackers, acknowledging practical limitations on perfect division.

The answer is 2. This interpretation assumes standard integer-based distribution under clear instructions for equality in a real-world setting, reflecting a practical understanding aligned with typical interaction guidelines.
