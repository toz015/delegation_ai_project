Paco started with 37 sweet cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies. We need to find out how many sweet cookies he ate which means we subtract the number of cookies eaten from the original amount. \n\nSo, \\(37 \\text{ (original amount)} - 5 \\text{ (amount eaten)} = 32 \\text{ (remaining)}\\)\n\nBut this calculation actually tells us how many sweet cookies he has left, not how many he ate directly. To clarify, when asked 'how many sweet cookies did Paco eat?', it's about understanding that Paco ate 5 sweet cookies specifically as stated in the problem statement. Therefore:\n\nThe answer is: 5\n\nThe response provided earlier was incorrect because it calculated how many sweet cookies remained instead of directly stating how many Paco ate.
