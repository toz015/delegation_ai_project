This means if she adds 'a' cups of flour, she'll have 'a + 8' cups of flour, but it does not specify how much flour was added yet. However, knowing the total required for flour is 6, we understand that the amount needed ('a') plus the excess over sugar makes up this total. Since the problem specifies the relationship rather than asking for a specific quantity solved from equations as initially interpreted, we can deduce based on the requirement for more flour compared to sugar, that she must add 8 cups of flour to meet the recipe's demand.
