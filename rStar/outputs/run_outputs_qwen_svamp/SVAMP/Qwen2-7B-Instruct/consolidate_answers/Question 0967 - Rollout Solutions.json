As such, for every additional cup of flour or sugar she adds, the same quantity will be added for salt.

However, since the recipe specifies a specific ratio and not quantities, it's implied that Mary should follow the recipe instructions closely, meaning no extra cups of any ingredient beyond those specified in the recipe should be used without altering the rest accordingly. Therefore, the focus remains on following the proportions given rather than strictly counting excesses.
