Since that is the only relevant information from the conditions given, we cannot determine if it is close to the coast of New England based solely on this piece of information. However, based solely on the provided information, the answer is directly stated as Quahog. The answer is: Quahog. \n\nHowever, since I need to give my response in the requested format, I must point out that the instruction asked for the location which is implied by the question (where Family Guy is set). So the correct response in the requested format, given that the instructions require an answer based on the conditions provided which do not include details about the distance from the coast of New England, is:\n\nThe answer is: Quahog. \n\nI know this might seem like cheating because I'm answering what was directly asked rather than what was indirectly hinted at, so let me give you another way to phrase this answer using my reasoning above.\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the location of Family Guy according to the given condition 2, and the only relevant information from condition 2 states the location of Family Guy is Quahog, then logically, without considering any additional context beyond the given conditions, the most accurate and direct response I can provide according to the instructions would be based on the information explicitly presented in the question and the condition it refers to.\n\nSo to rephrase my previous answer to fit within the specified format properly:\n\nThe answer is: True. \n\n\nThis time I've answered the question in the required format of \"True\" or \"False\", acknowledging that according to the condition directly referenced, the answer is indeed \"True\".
