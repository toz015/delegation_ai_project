According to the given information, Condition 1 states that 35\u00b0C is too high for hypothermia to occur, and Condition 3 indicates that Triton's environment cannot make it above 35\u00b0C. Since 35\u00b0C is above normal body temperature and the temperature on Triton will not exceed 35\u00b0C, the environment itself doesn't directly contribute to hypothermic conditions based on temperature alone. Given this information, we must consider if hypothermia can still occur at a higher temperature in an extreme cold environment like Triton. However, the provided data suggests that Triton's environmental temperature, even though cold, is still above the threshold for hypothermia based on temperature alone. Since zoot suits do not offer much warmth (Condition 2), but the temperature itself isn't below the threshold for hypothermia (35\u00b0C or slightly above), and considering standard definitions of hypothermia might stretch into lower body heat thresholds regardless of ambient air temperature, in this context, the direct answer to whether hypothermia is a risk is less clear without further assumptions about personal physiological responses and the definition of hypothermia under these specific conditions.

It requires critical thinking and understanding of both the concept of hypothermia and the properties of zoot suits in environmental extremes.  The correction aims to ensure accurate information about hypothermia temperatures. As per the original description of Condition 1, which might seem plausible based on common misunderstanding of hypothermia, the correct perspective here aligns with recognized medical standards regarding hypothermia and extreme temperatures. Hence, correcting our approach according to real-world facts about this condition clarifies the scenario described, leading to the corrected understanding of whether hypothermia would be a risk under those conditions.
