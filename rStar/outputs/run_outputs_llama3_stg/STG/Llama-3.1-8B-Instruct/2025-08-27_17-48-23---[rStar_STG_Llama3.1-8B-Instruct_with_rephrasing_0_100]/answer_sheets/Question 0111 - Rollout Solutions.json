Considering Condition 2, we know that the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena is a former arena located in California, USA, which might imply its size and capacity can accommodate large events. Nevertheless, this assumption is based solely on the fact that it hosted various concerts and sports games in the past, not specifically considering if the arena has sufficient space for festival structures like those at Coachella, which include large stages, tents, and vendors.\n\nConsidering Condition 3, while the arena may have held concerts and sports games, which implies some capacity for large gatherings, festivals like Coachella require significantly more space and logistical support beyond what most arenas traditionally offer. They also demand flexible interior spaces to allow for stage arrangements, vendor areas, camping sites, and so forth, which traditional sports venues often cannot easily accommodate due to design limitations.\n\nTherefore, even though the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena has hosted large events, without specific knowledge about its current layout or post-renovation capabilities, it seems unlikely it would have been adequately equipped to handle the unique demands of hosting an event like Coachella.
