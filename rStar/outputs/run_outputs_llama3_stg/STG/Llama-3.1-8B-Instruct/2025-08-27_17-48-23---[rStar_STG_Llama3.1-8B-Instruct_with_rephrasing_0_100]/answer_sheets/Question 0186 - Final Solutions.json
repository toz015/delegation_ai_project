According to Condition 2, judo is classified as a modern martial art. This indicates that it follows the principles and practices of traditional martial arts, which include a ranking system based on experience and skill level. Given Condition 1, mainstream judo uses a color-coded belt system followed by a numerical rank progression starting at 1st dan. Practitioners can progress through these ranks based on their skills, techniques, and performance in competitions. Since some colors on the belt system are associated with high-level ranks (e.g., black belt), numerical ranks can exceed double digits because after a practitioner reaches a specific black belt rank, they advance through higher dan ranks.

Within traditional and mainstream judo practices recognized by the International Judo Federation (IJF), ranks typically progress from novice, through colored belts, and into black belt ranks starting at 6th dan and continuing upwards. The IJF, which oversees most international competitions and national judo organizations worldwide, uses a unified system that does not extend beyond specific maximum ranks that can vary slightly depending on the organization but generally do not go beyond high single digits. The highest rank achievable under IJF rules is 10th Dan. Therefore, within mainstream judo practices recognized by the IJF, it is possible for practitioners to achieve ranks beyond double-digit numbers when considering systems that award higher ranks such as some honorary or lifetime achievement awards beyond the standard 10th Dan.
