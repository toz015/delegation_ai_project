There was only one notable queen among the Tudors who named herself after another monarch - Catherine Parr was named after her mother-in-law, Katherine of Aragon, and also after Mary I named ships after some female relatives like Catherine of Aragon. But none of them named themselves after a Tudor monarch. One famous example that named themselves after a family member is Queen Elizabeth, named after her own mother, Bessie Blount, who also named her daughter Elizabeth.

Another is likely Mary of Guise who named her daughter Mary after her own sister and thus also after her own mother.

Instead though we know Anne's namesake isn't even any type of blood relative so let\u2019s just consider another figure from history then! This person who named their self after their relative is none other than  the second Tudor queen \u2013 Catherine Parr - who named her daughter 'Mary\u2019 after her first husband's (Edward Burgh's) ex-wife, \u2018Mary Howard', who was indeed a descendant of Stuarts from France. So the correct answer here must indeed be - this second Tudor queen - the sixth wife of Henry VIII was the one who got named after her relative (her ex-husband Edward's former wife).

Did Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and her daughter share name with Tudor queen?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Who were the Tudor queens named after?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. There was only one notable queen among the Tudors who named herself after another monarch - Catherine Parr was named after her mother-in-law, Katherine of Aragon, and also after Mary I named ships after some female relatives like Catherine of Aragon. But none of them named themselves after a Tudor monarch. One famous example that named themselves after a family member is Queen Elizabeth, named after her own mother, Bessie Blount, who also named her daughter Elizabeth. The Tudor queen named after a non-Tudor was actually Mary I being named after Saint Mary the mother of Jesus.  However, the specific example you're likely thinking of is likely about the Tudor queen Mary I having been named after her grandmother. Another is likely Mary of Guise who named her daughter Mary after her own sister and thus also after her own mother. But most notably there was one instance when Margaret of Anjou, wife of Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses, named one of her daughters 'Margaret' after her mother which might fit well into this category for a later instance; however for this question I will choose a famous figure who's name directly referenced another royal: it would likely be Anne of Cleves, who didn't exactly name herself after someone in particular however her cousin the young Princess Mary chose to take the name she originally had planned on taking for her own child. Instead though we know Anne's namesake isn't even any type of blood relative so let\u2019s just consider another figure from history then! This person who named their self after their relative is none other than  the second Tudor queen \u2013 Catherine Parr - who named her daughter 'Mary\u2019 after her first husband's (Edward Burgh's) ex-wife, \u2018Mary Howard', who was indeed a descendant of Stuarts from France. So the correct answer here must indeed be - this second Tudor queen - the sixth wife of Henry VIII was the one who got named after her relative (her ex-husband Edward's former wife). She got named after Mary Howard - a lady in waiting at court during the reign of King Edward VI - after whom her child was named Mary following Catherine of Aragon and Catherine Parr\u2019s relationship. The question doesn't ask though which Tudor queen was named after another monarch - it asks us to tell who they were named after. And that makes sense given all those instances above, because it asks for an individual instance - the one case mentioned there and which best fits this query - would therefore have to indeed be the last one. The answer is: false. \n\nNote: Based on my previous analysis \u2013 we can now say, based upon information we may already have, that these were all of them: and that there might not be too many examples left - the most obvious one that comes immediately to mind after doing some research was - the last one \u2013 namely Catherine Parr who was named after her mother in law. But since this wasn\u2019t the one asked, we will have to go back to our original choice. It seems I provided you with incorrect options. My apologies - this time I think I need to provide a real option then, which has nothing to do with the two women I previously explained: Catherine and Mary.
