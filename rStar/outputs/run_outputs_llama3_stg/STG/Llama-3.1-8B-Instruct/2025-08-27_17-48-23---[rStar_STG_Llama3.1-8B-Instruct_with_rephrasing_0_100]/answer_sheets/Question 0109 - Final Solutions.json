Its current constitutional structure and content may reflect aspects of those influences rather than directly copying from the British constitution. Although it's difficult to provide a definitive answer without specific details about the Philippine Constitution's content, given the country's history, the influence might not come directly from the British system, making the statement likely false. The answer is: false. \n\nHowever, I would recommend a more thorough analysis of the Constitution itself to confirm the presence or absence of borrowed elements from the British system. The complexity of legal systems and constitutions makes direct comparisons challenging. The answer is: false. \n\nGiven the fact that the Philippines was never a direct British colony, its constitution should not have borrowed much if anything from the British model; however, it is impossible to say categorically without analyzing the document itself for any explicit or implicit references to the British constitution.
