People with Anorexia nervosa often experience malnutrition, which can weaken bones and make them more prone to fractures. Furthermore, their bodies may also suffer from changes associated with poor nutrition, such as weaker muscles and poorer overall physical strength, making them even more susceptible to falls and injuries. Given these factors, it seems plausible that a person with Anorexia nervosa would be more likely to break a bone than a regular person. The answer is: true. \n\nHowever, this conclusion might vary based on several individual factors. For example, the severity of anorexia symptoms, the presence of co-morbid medical conditions, and other factors can influence an individual's risk of injury. Hence, caution must be exercised when interpreting general statements about individuals experiencing specific conditions.\n\nIt's worth noting that this problem requires a deeper understanding of human biology and psychology rather than pure logic, so some ambiguity remains in the interpretation of this particular question. To resolve this issue we'll need to refer to medical literature for the most accurate information available. But according to current general knowledge, a person suffering from anorexia nervosa has a higher chance of breaking a bone due to various physiological effects mentioned above. If we want a clear answer without referring to medical literature our result will remain inconclusive.\n\nSo what do we conclude?\nBased on basic reasoning, a more detailed explanation, and a bit of medical context, the best answer we can provide is that it's very likely someone with anorexia nervosa might experience a greater number of bone breaks compared to a normal person. The answer is: true.\n\nPlease note that real-world conclusions require looking into the complexity of issues at hand.
