You can check the official website of the Grand Canyon for up-to-date pricing.\n*   Can you tell me about the history of Japan?\n    *   This is a broad topic, but I'd be happy to give a brief overview of Japanese history. \n        *   Ancient History: Japan has a rich ancient history dating back to the Jomon period (14,000 - 300 BCE). The Jomon people are believed to have arrived in Japan from the Asian mainland.\n        *   Classical Period: Around 400 BCE, Japan entered its classical period, which saw the introduction of Buddhism and Confucianism from China and Korea. This led to the development of a complex social hierarchy.\n        *   Feudal Period: From the 12th century onwards, Japan was ruled by the samurai class during the feudal period. This era saw the rise of powerful daimyos and the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.\n        *   Meiji Restoration: In 1868, the Meiji restoration marked the beginning of modern Japan.
