Condition 3 provides information about a specific object called the king-sized mattress. With this knowledge, let's think logically about the relationship between these two things: the subject (the largest crustacean) and the object (the king-sized mattress). It seems that there is a comparison being suggested between something's size and something else's ability to accommodate it. Given that the king-sized mattress can fit an adult lying flat on it, and considering that some crustaceans like lobsters or even larger ones can extend their bodies, it's theoretically possible that the largest crustacean could indeed spread out across the entire surface of the king-sized mattress if it can physically accommodate it. However, this comparison leans heavily on the assumption that the crustacean's body length can reach or exceed that of the mattress when fully extended. Based solely on Conditions 1 through 3, without additional details about the specific dimensions of both the crustacean and the mattress, we cannot definitively say yes or no, but based on the given conditions and general knowledge about crustacean sizes and mattress sizes, there exists a possibility for it to happen depending on how you define 'stretching'. The answer is: true.\n\nIn order to solve the problem, we need to determine if the conditions are true.
