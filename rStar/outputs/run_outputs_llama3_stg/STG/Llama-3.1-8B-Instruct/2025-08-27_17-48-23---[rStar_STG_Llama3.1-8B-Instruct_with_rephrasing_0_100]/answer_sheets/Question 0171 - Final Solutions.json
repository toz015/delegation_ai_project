Thus, 2015 contains the same number of occurrences of each weekday as a typical Gregorian calendar year. The number of Fridays in a year can vary but will always be 52 since each month has at least 28 days and January and March both have 31 days, which means that these two months alone contribute a total of 62 Fridays (February has either 28 days or 29 days depending on whether it is a leap year).

According to common understanding, every year has exactly 52 weeks, which means each year has 52 Fridays, assuming the week begins on Monday. This pattern does not change from year to year; therefore, the number of Fridays in any given year, like 2015, remains constant. The concept of having more or fewer \"unlucky Fridays\" does not affect the number of Fridays that occur annually based solely on the calendar system. Thus, the number of Fridays in 2015, according to our understanding of these concepts, does not differ significantly from those of other years in terms of being considered \"lucky\" or \"unlucky.\" However, considering the nature of the question seems to ask if the occurrence changes across different years, implying we must evaluate the premise rather than factually count them. Given this, the framing implies a comparison based on a fixed number per year, making the real inquiry about variability in perception or societal interpretation of Friday's luck, not a factual count. If considering interpretation or belief alone, then the premise might imply looking at variations in cultural significance or personal beliefs regarding luck, in which case one might argue interpretations can vary, suggesting the answer might seem different from what is stated above. But the actual question is whether the number of Fridays falls differently depending on the year, based on cultural perceptions. Since that question does not change, we will say that, indeed, Fridays remain constant regardless of the year. The number of Fridays falling during the year 2015 does not reflect a difference in how many \"unlucky Fridays\" occur compared to other years because the base factor\u2014how often Fridays appear\u2014is constant, and it does not change from year to year. The number of Fridays is determined by the calendar structure, making every year equal in this regard. Thus, considering only the information provided without delving into superstitious beliefs, the answer is that the number of Fridays in 2015, in relation to the concept of lucky or unlucky days specifically tied to Fridays and comparing it against other years under this criterion, doesn't directly indicate a variation due to luck.

This conclusion might need further discussion in contexts of psychological study or cultural interpretation, but based strictly on the calendrical definition of Fridays, the premise is incorrect as presented for interpreting differences based on the criteria specified.

Hence, considering just the literal aspect as posed, the logical deduction would point towards \"constant,\" yet acknowledging broader implications of perception and belief, the phrasing of the query leans more toward a misunderstanding or misinterpretation due to its strictness in defining 'different.'

Every year has at least one Friday the 13th, but the frequency or occurrence of \"unlucky Fridays\" per year is what we need to calculate.\n\nSince determining the exact number of unlucky Fridays requires knowing the date of each Friday the 13th within the year 2015, let's proceed under the assumption that these are the only Fridays considered unlucky.\n\n**Step 1:** Identify the total Fridays in 2015.\n\n- There are 365 days in 2015 (not a leap year).\n- Since every week has one Friday, we can divide 365 by 7 to get the total number of Fridays.\n\n365 days / 7 days/week = 52 weeks (with 4 extra days as remainder).\n\nThere are exactly 52 Fridays within the given year, making a total count of 52 Fridays. Given the fact that there will be at least 1 Black Friday occurring throughout the year (which falls on the 13th day of any particular month), some of those might fall on a date that is generally believed to be unlucky.\n\n\nTherefore, if we consider only the ones that are unlucky and use them as a basis of comparison to other years, it suggests that the years with 1 Friday the 13th have a higher number of unlucky Fridays compared to other years without this event.\n\nHence, the year 2015 would have more unlucky Fridays than other years with similar properties, i.e., years with fewer or the same number of occurrences of Friday the 13th.
