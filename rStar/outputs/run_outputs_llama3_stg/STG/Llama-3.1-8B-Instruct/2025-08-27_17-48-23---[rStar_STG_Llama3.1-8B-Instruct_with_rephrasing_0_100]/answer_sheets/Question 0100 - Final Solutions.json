Assuming a typical passenger car weighs around 1500 kilograms, a rough estimate could involve calculating the average deceleration over the duration of the crash, though this is extremely difficult without precise data. Typically, in such accidents, the acceleration and deceleration phases would result in extremely high forces due to the rapid change in velocity. Even an approximate calculation involving known quantities like initial and final velocities, assuming uniform deceleration, might yield an order-of-magnitude estimate of the forces involved.
