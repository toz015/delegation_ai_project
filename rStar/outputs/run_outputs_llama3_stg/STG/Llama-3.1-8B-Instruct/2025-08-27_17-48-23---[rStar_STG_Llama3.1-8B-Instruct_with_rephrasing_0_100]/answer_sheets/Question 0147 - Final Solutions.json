This means a full carton has exactly 12 spaces filled with eggs, but nothing more. So even if Johnny Carson received only 1 Emmy award, he could still fill at least one full egg carton because it already matches the capacity of one carton.

Regardless of the number of Emmy awards Johnny Carson received, since that information isn't relevant to determining the carton capacity, the question is essentially asking if he could fill a full carton with some unspecified number of eggs, which is possible because it doesn't matter what the number is - the carton itself has space for 12.
