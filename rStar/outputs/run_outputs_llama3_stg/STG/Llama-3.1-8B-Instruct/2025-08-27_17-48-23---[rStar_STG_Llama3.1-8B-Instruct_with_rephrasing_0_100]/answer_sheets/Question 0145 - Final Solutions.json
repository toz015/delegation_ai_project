To determine if 200 men lined up end-to-end can cover the base of the Great Pyramid of Giza, we need to consider its dimensions. The base perimeter of the Great Pyramid is approximately 3,025 meters.

So, the base is approximately 1525 meters long. Now, dividing the total base length by individual lengths, we get 1525/1.87=814.35 which results in 815. Now, considering that we want to know whether 200 men could fit along the pyramid's base from one edge to the other, if the number is indeed higher than the estimated 814.35, then they might, but since it is lower (and not even close), it means the men will just fall short of being able to cover the entire base when aligned end-to-end.

First, calculate how long 200 men can stand end-to-end. Given that they are about 6 feet tall each, 200 men would be approximately 1200 feet long when standing end-to-end. Next, we need to find out the total base perimeter length of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The base perimeter of the Great Pyramid of Giza is about 3,025 feet long. Since 200 men standing end-to-end measure 1200 feet, which is less than the base perimeter length, it is theoretically possible for 200 men standing end-to-end to cover part of the base perimeter of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The answer is: true. However, since the total base perimeter length of the pyramid exceeds the length of 200 men standing end-to-end, they cannot cover the entire base perimeter. This statement was wrong; actually, we can say that 200 men can cover at most half of the base perimeter because the actual perimeter is over twice the length of 200 men standing end-to-end. The correct answer should be: yes, but only partially. Thus, this new understanding renders the original assertion incorrect. The revised statement is now accurate as follows: The answer is: true. But since our calculation showed that they only can cover the half, let's change it and rephrase the question: Can 200 men cover the whole base perimeter if we assume that they can stretch much further to fill the space like ropes? With the given assumption,  the new answer will be: true. So considering the revised problem, the real answer will be: The answer is: true. Now if the problem stays as is without any revision and with normal human proportions, then the real answer is: The answer is: false. As we established above when normal proportions were used, thus providing the evidence needed to refute the initial claim. Then the corrected conclusion should look like: The answer is: false. The final answer is: The answer is: false. We know that the base perimeter is larger than the total length that 200 men can occupy, as calculated earlier.
