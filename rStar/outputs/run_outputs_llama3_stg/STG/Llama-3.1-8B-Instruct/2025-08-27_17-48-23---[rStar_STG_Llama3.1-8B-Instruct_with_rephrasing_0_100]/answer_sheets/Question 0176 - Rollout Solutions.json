Here's how you can provide a detailed response:\n\nDuring a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack, the flow of oxygen-rich blood to a part of the heart is blocked. This blockage occurs when a coronary artery becomes narrowed or completely obstructed due to a blood clot, often as a result of atherosclerosis or plaque buildup. As the blood supply is cut off, the heart muscle cells begin to die from lack of oxygen, leading to tissue damage and potentially permanent scarring. If left untreated, a myocardial infarction can cause severe consequences, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and even sudden death.\n\nNow, let me revise my answer to match your required response format:\n\nThe answer is: true.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "I apologize for the mistake earlier.
