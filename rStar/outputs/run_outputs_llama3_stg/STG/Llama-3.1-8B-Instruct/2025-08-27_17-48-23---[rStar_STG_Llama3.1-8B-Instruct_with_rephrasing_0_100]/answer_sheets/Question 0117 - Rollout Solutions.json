Let's break down the information:\n\n*   Clades are defined by the fact that all members of a clade share a common ancestor.\n*   Africanized bees are a type of insect within the genus **Apis**.\n*   Within this genus, Africanized bees represent a distinct species that has undergone hybridization with European honeybees (Apis mellifera), leading to the creation of a new, highly aggressive, subspecies.\n\nHere's a possible answer based on these considerations:\n\n\nThe answer is: true.\n\n\nIn general, the classification and categorization of species can sometimes reflect broader taxonomic relationships and clades. So when considering whether Africanized bees can be classified into various multi-clades or not, bear in mind that they do belong to multiple groups within their species due to their origins through cross-breeding with another closely-related species. This complexity makes them fit into various multi-clades as well as having clear ties to their ancestors. Therefore, the classification of Africanized bees might include both different groups and also their connections to other bees within the same family.
