Under Condition 2, evaluating the legal treatment at the time shows it to be based on outdated and intolerant beliefs about human sexuality. These beliefs do not align with contemporary values of equality and human rights. Condition 3 asks us to consider whether such treatment would be deemed acceptable under current U.S. legal standards.
