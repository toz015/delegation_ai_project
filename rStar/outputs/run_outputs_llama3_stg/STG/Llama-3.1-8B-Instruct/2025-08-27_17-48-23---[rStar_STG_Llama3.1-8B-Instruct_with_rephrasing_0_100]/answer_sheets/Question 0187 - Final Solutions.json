The answer is false.  (The previous response assumed traditional use; but actual answer must consider if either could be trained to respond - both could.)   Therefore the correct answer should consider training ability of both. The response from Question 4 gives insight here: While dogs may generally be considered able to learn association with bells quickly, the conditions under which a Grey seal would be given a bell is certainly possible; and then the seal will also quickly learn. Thus, after training both are equal in time to respond to the bell. And since both can be trained to ring the bell, they should be equally adept to recognize its ringing. Therefore the question is effectively asking whether a dog learns to ring a bell faster than a Grey seal does so. It now seems likely that both could learn about as fast as each other depending on what stimulus is paired with the bell. That leaves room for either dog or seal to initially ring the bell faster, with no basis to say one definitively rings sooner than the other.

There isn't conclusive evidence that Grey seals inherently understand or respond to auditory signals such as bells, unlike some other marine mammals that may use echolocation.
