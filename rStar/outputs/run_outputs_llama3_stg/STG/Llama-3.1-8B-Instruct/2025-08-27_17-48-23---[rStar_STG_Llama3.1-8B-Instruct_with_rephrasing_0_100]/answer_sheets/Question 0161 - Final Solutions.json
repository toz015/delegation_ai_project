Based on Conditions 1 and 2, we know that \"Bonanza\" is a TV series that has been around since 1959 and is classified as a Western/Cowboy show. The length of a Bonanza marathon isn't explicitly mentioned in these conditions, so let's assume a typical TV show marathon lasts several hours. For WWE Heat, given its classification as another TV program in the same hint, it seems reasonable to expect it to last similarly. Let's consider an example scenario assuming they both run for 8 hours straight without any breaks in their respective time slots. If \"Bonanza\" started at 10 AM and ran continuously until the end, by the time \"WWE Heat\" began at 6 PM, there might not be enough time left in the day to watch even half of the WWE Heat marathon before bedtime. However, this scenario depends heavily on the assumption of similar marathon lengths for both programs, which is not explicitly confirmed.

But considering general assumptions, it is indeed plausible under certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, according to our previous instructions and the format required, I must make an educated guess based on common understanding of marathon lengths for TV shows and television programming. Considering most marathon types for TV shows like WWE's, let alone typical, is usually around 1 hour to 45 minutes. Given the typical duration of wrestling events, WWE generally lasts longer but let's take the average WWE marathon as roughly around 4-5 hours in length because professional sports programs such as WWE often exceed the standard 45 minutes to an hour. We know the number of hours Bonanza lasted is 14 years x episodes per year (approximately 20/season), 14 * 20 = 280 episodes at 50 minutes each episode results in a total runtime of 14000 minutes /60 = 233 hours.

Given the nature of both Bonanza and WWE Heat, there's potential overlap in how they structure their marathons, especially considering WWE Heat's use of archived content. This means both types of marathons might span different eras and stories simultaneously. Although there's a high chance both marathons will finish and start around similar times, it's entirely possible for WWE Heat's marathon to technically finish after the conclusion of Bonanza's marathon.
