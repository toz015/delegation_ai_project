An Olympic athlete might be extremely fit, but even the fastest runner could not cover long distances without being fatigued at some point. For example, a world-class sprinter may struggle to maintain pace after several miles due to physical strain, particularly considering the high-intensity effort required for such short races. However, whether they're exhausted depends on their specific event, training, and condition. For instance, someone participating in shorter sprint events will not experience as much exhaustion compared to those in longer distance races. The answer is: false. \n\nHowever, we must note that this problem was slightly ambiguous since it only asked if the athlete \"would be tired out,\" which might imply an absolute state rather than a relative comparison. Thus, we should clarify that a world-class sprinter will likely feel very fatigued and tired after such an intense effort, especially given the immense energy expenditure over a short period. Given the vagueness of the query, one possible interpretation could lean towards a positive affirmation based on the context provided about extreme athletic feats. Yet, under typical circumstances where 'exhaustion' implies both physical and mental depletion, the statement might still hold ground based on its literal meaning.\n\nThis clarification aims to acknowledge potential misinterpretations of the question and its implications regarding extreme athletic performance versus normal human expectations. If rephrased to ask specifically about exhaustion following a race like a 400-meter dash versus a 26-mile marathon, clearer differentiation between scenarios involving various degrees of endurance and stamina could be drawn.
