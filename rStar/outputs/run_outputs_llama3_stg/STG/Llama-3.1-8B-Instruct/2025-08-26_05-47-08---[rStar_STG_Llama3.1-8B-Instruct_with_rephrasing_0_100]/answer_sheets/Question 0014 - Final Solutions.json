We know only that he is being considered (which does not guarantee meeting qualifications) and that the Army Rangers are an elite unit (whose qualifications are presumably very stringent). Without knowing more about Michael J Fox's background, abilities, or any actual service or attempt to join the Army Rangers, it's impossible to make a definitive judgment about whether he meets the qualification standards. The correct answer should reflect the uncertainty rather than speculation.
