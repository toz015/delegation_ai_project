A sable can refer to several different things in biology. It often refers to a type of fur or coat, specifically from the weasel family (Mustela spp.). Given this context, let's assume that when the word \"sable\" is mentioned without further specification, it most likely refers to either the black sable marten (Martes zibellina), which has a highly prized and expensive fur, or to the color itself, a dark brown to black color. Based on this information alone, however, there isn't enough to conclude what exactly it refers to in biology with certainty. But given the options provided, if we need to choose, based on the fact that it refers to something within the biological realm, I'll give a guess based on my understanding of general knowledge about biology. If you don't have any specific definition or explanation provided, then it will depend on the context of how the term 'sable' is being used in the conversation. But generally speaking, if I had to pick between these two based solely on common usage and without any further details, I'd say a sable most likely refers to a marten belonging to the species Martes zibellina due to its distinctive, valuable fur.

However, since both wolverine and sable/martens are members of the Mustelidae family and thus distantly related, the correct interpretation might require clarification of what species the speaker is referring to as 'sable'. Assuming the speaker meant any member of the weasel family (Mustela spp.), the conclusion that wolverines and sables are related holds because both are within the broader context of the weasel family, albeit with a nuanced distinction. The answer is: true. \n\nNote that there is still ambiguity in the question because it's not entirely clear what species the speaker means by 'sable', leading to possible misinterpretation.
