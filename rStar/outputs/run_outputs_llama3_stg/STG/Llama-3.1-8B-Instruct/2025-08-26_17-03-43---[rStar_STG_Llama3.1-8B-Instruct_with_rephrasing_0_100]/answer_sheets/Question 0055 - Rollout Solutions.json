Iron requirements vary with age and sex. However, according to the World Health Organization, the recommended dietary allowance for iron has changed over time due to better understanding of nutritional needs and bioavailability.

So let's assume that the statement might refer to changes in recommendations over time rather than recommending zero intake at some point. The exact change can depend on several factors like age, sex, and geographical location.
