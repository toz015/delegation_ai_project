However, since both wolverine and sable/martens are members of the Mustelidae family and thus distantly related, the correct interpretation might require clarification of what species the speaker is referring to as 'sable'. Assuming the speaker meant any member of the weasel family (Mustela spp.), the conclusion that wolverines and sables are related holds because both are within the broader context of the weasel family, albeit with a nuanced distinction. The answer is: true. \n\nNote that there is still ambiguity in the question because it's not entirely clear what species the speaker means by 'sable', leading to possible misinterpretation.
