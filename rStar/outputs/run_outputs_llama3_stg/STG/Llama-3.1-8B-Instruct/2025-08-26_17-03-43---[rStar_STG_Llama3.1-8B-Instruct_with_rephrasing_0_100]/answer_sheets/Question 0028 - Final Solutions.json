Condition 1 states that the observer is eating lunch on the beach. This means the observer is in a location near the ocean's surface where they are exposed to sea spray or puddles of water from the waves. These tiny droplets can act as prisms, refracting sunlight into the colors we see in a rainbow. Condition 2 mentions that the observation occurs during a time when a rainbow can potentially appear. This implies there are suitable atmospheric conditions for a rainbow, such as after a light rain shower or during the late morning/early afternoon when the sun is at a favorable angle. Both conditions suggest there would be small water droplets present, which is crucial for seeing a rainbow. The key factor here is whether the observer is in a spot where the entire arc of a rainbow can be seen. For the observer to see the complete arc of a rainbow, the sun needs to be behind them and above their horizon line, allowing them to look along the arc formed by the sunlight refracted through the water droplets.
