Based on Condition 1, we know that cooking involves applying heat to prepare food for consumption. Considering Condition 2, the fact that the electric stove has a glass top suggests that it might require special care regarding what types of cookware can be used directly on its surface. This usually means avoiding heavy pans or those prone to scratching the glass due to thermal shock or material abrasion.\n\nCast-iron skillets, despite being durable, can pose issues under these conditions because they are both heavy and prone to sudden changes in temperature when heated or cooled, which could potentially cause damage to the glass surface. Furthermore, cast-iron requires seasoning and has sharp edges when new, posing a risk of scratching any delicate surfaces like those found on some modern stoves.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, it would generally not be advisable to use cast-iron skillets directly on a glass-topped electric stove without proper precautions, cautioning against potential damage to either the skillet or the stove.
