The answer is: false. \n\nHowever, since we don't know the exact weight of this specific cow, let's analyze based on the given weights and the statement of the question. If the Holstein cow has its maximum possible weight, it might exceed the Liberty Bell's weight, making the two possibly equivalent under specific conditions, which seems unlikely without more context. But considering typical ranges, it's reasonable to assume that the cow doesn't weigh as much as the Liberty Bell usually does.
