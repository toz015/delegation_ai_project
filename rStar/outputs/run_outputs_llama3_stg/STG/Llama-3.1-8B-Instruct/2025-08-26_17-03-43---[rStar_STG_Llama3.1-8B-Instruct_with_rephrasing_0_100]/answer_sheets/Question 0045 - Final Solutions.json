Based on public knowledge about Arnold Schwarzenegger's background and career, we know he was a professional bodybuilder and won the Mr. Olympia title seven times, which is a testament to his remarkable physical strength. However, attempting to lift a black rhinoceros is highly unrealistic and dangerous due to the immense weight and power of these large mammals. Given the context, the question likely aims to provoke a humorous or impossible scenario rather than provide factual information.

The answer is: true. \n\nHowever, for further clarification regarding the second part of the question regarding the black rhino lifting, I want to note that it is extremely unlikely that any person can lift a black rhinoceros safely without causing harm to both humans and animals involved. This action would require incredible unnatural physical capabilities beyond what any human is capable of achieving. The possibility of this happening is virtually zero. The answer to whether Arnold Schwarzenegger can do it is also false considering real-world limitations and ethics. \n\nTo clarify, here is another possible statement if we consider only the second part of the question focusing on the impossibility of lifting a black rhinoceros safely:\n\nThe answer is: false.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How much does an average adult black rhinoceros weigh?", "subanswer": {"text": "An average adult black rhinoceros weighs between 700-900 kg (1540-1980 lbs).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
