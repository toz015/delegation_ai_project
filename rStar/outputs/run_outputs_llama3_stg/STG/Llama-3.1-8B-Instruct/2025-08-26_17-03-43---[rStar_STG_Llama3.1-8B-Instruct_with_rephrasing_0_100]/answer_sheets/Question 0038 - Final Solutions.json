Glass stovetops are generally flat and smooth surfaces designed for cooking with pots and pans without metal-to-metal contact that might scratch the surface. Considering the need to protect the seasoning on cast-iron skillets and the risk of damaging the stovetop, it is generally recommended to use silicone or non-stick utensils when transferring hot cast iron off the stovetop to prevent scratching the surface.
