Given the information from Hint 1, we know that the Space Race involved a series of significant accomplishments in space travel and exploration.

Thus, the original query might have been misleading since relay batons aren't associated with the Space Race at all; they're part of athletic competitions like track and field events. Since the question seems based on incorrect premises regarding the use of relay batons in a context they don't belong to, let's consider what's being asked - if the Space Race indeed used relay batons.
