He also had numerous illegitimate children and grandchildren through his concubines, further expanding his genetic legacy.\n  \n- **Historical Context:** Mongolia was a vast empire during Genghis Khan's time, allowing for extensive territorial expansion and mingling of populations, which contributed to a broader dispersal of his descendants.\n\n- **Family Ties:** Unlike Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar had few recorded children and none that achieved the same level of power and longevity, thereby limiting the scope of his genetic influence beyond Rome.\n\nConsidering these points, it's logical to conclude that the global reach and diversity of Genghis Khan's descendants exceed those of Julius Caesar.\n\n**The answer is: true.**", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jukebox musical: stage or film musical compiled from pre-existing songs.
