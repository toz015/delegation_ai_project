Tragic events can vary greatly but generally involve severe loss or significant hardship. Dr. Seuss experienced the loss of his first wife, Helen Palmer, which could be considered a personal tragedy, given its impact on him. Additionally, he faced challenges throughout his career and life, though these do not necessarily fit the traditional mold of tragedy like a death. Given that he remarried after the loss of his first spouse, we can say that he still lived a life with significant personal hardships. However, considering that the hint emphasizes that we're looking at whether Dr. Seuss' life was 'tragedy-free', this suggests that yes, he did experience a tragedy - the loss of his first wife, making his second marriage a part of a life that included significant personal tragedy.
