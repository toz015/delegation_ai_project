Based on the given information, the area enclosed by the Moscow Kremlin exceeds that covered by Disneyland itself, especially considering the total land area controlled by Disneyland when including adjacent parks and resorts.

Given the information provided, however, the answer hinges on what 'inside' precisely means. If strictly referring to the Kremlin's wall-enclosed space, then yes, because it's larger; however, if considering all controlled spaces, Disneyland might still hold everything within its broader boundaries, assuming they allow expansion. This leaves room for interpretation based on how strictly 'fitting inside' is applied.
