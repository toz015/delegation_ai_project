Based on the geographical locations provided in the conditions, the Statue of Freedom is situated in Washington, D.C. and the Statue of Liberty is located off the coast of New York/New Jersey. It is theoretically possible to view the Statue of Freedom from a high vantage point near the Statue of Liberty, such as from the roof of a tall building on Ellis Island, assuming there are no obstructions blocking the line of sight. However, due to natural and man-made barriers like buildings and trees in the intervening area, as well as the height disparity between the two monuments, direct visual observation of the Statue of Freedom from the location of the Statue of Liberty is unlikely. \n\nThus, it is indeed possible to attempt viewing the Statue of Freedom from where the Statue of Liberty stands, provided one chooses a high enough viewpoint.
