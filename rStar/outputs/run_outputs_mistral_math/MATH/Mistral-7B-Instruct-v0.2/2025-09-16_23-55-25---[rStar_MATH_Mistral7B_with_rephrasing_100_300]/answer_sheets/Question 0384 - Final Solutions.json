The terms containing $x$ are $19x$ and $-4x$, so we add their coefficients to get the common coefficient of $x$: $19+(-4)=\\boxed{15}$. Now we can combine those terms: $15x+1-81$. To finish simplifying, we subtract $81$ from the constant term: $15x-80$. The answer is: $15x-80$.", "value": 0.5625}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
