Let $(h,k)$ be the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. According to the problem statement, an equilateral triangle is inscribed in the parabola, with one of its vertices at the vertex of the parabola. Let $a$ be the length of a side of the equilateral triangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, $h^2+k^2=a^2/3.$ Also, since the triangle is inscribed in the parabola, the midpoints of the sides lie on the parabola. Let $(h+\\frac{a}{2},k+\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be one of those midpoints. We know that it lies on the parabola, so $$(h+\\frac{a}{2})^2=(8)(k+\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}).$$ Expanding the squares and simplifying, we get $$h^2+h a+(\\frac{a^2}{4})+(\\frac{a^2}{2})=8 k+8 (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}).$$ Rearr", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "Simplifying the equation, we get $h a+(\\frac{a^2}{2})=8 k+8 (\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}).$"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "First, let's complete the square for the parabolic equation $x^2 = 8y$:\n$$\nx^2 = 8y \\\\\nx^2 = 8(y-\\frac{1}{2})+\\frac{64}{4} \\\\\nx^2 = 8(y-\\frac{1}{2}+2) \\\\\nx^2 = 8(y-(\\frac{1}{2}-2)) \\\\\n(x-4\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8(y-\\frac{5}{2})\n$$\nThis equation describes a parabola with a vertex at $(\\boxed{-4\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{5}{2}})$. Now, since an equilateral triangle is inscribed in this parabola, one of its sides lies along the axis of symmetry. Thus, one of the triangles' sides has length equal to $2|b|$, where $b$ is the width of the base of the right triangle formed by the tangent line at the vertex of the parabola and the $x$-axis. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $|b|^2 = x^2", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
