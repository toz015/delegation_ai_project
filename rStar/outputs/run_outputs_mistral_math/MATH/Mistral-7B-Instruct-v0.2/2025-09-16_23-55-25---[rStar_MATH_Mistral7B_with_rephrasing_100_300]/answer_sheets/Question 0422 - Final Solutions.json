The four roots of the equation $x^4+2x^3+2=0$ are $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3$, and $\\alpha_4$. Using the given expressions, the sums we need to determine are $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3\\alpha_4$, $\\alpha_1\\alpha_3+\\alpha_2\\alpha_4$, and $\\alpha_1\\alpha_4+\\alpha_2\\alpha_3$. These sums are not necessarily distinct since we are not asking for the distinct sums but rather the unordered set of them. Therefore, the answer is the unordered set containing $\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3\\alpha_4$, $\\alpha_1\\alpha_3+\\alpha_2\\alpha_4$, and $\\alpha_1\\alpha_4+\\alpha_2\\alpha_3$. The answer is: {$\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+\\alpha_3\\alpha_4$, $\\alpha_1\\alpha_3+\\alpha_2\\alpha_4$, $\\alpha_1\\alpha_4+\\alpha_2\\alpha_3", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
