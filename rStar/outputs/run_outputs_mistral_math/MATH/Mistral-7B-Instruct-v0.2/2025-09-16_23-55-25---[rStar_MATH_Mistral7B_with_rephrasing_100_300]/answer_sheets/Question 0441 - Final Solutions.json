To find out how many gallons of gasoline Karla saved by driving the hybrid car instead of her SUV, first find out how many miles she would have driven with the same amount of gasoline in the hybrid car. With a fuel efficiency of 48 miles per gallon, the hybrid car would let her travel $\\frac{12,000}{48}=250$ miles per gallon. Therefore, to cover the same 12,000 miles as with her SUV, she would need $\\frac{12,000}{250}=\\boxed{48}$ gallons of gasoline for the hybrid car. Subtracting the amount of gasoline she used with the SUV from the amount she would have used with the hybrid car gives us the difference, which is the amount of gasoline she saved: $800 - 48 = \\boxed{796}$ gallons. The answer is: 796 gallons.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
