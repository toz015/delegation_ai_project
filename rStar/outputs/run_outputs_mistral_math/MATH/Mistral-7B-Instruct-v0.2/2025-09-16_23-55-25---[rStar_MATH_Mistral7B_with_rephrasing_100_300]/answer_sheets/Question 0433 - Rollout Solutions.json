To find how many times 16 goes into a number, we divide that number by 16. But, in condition 1, the fraction is $\\frac{57}{160}$.

To find this multiple, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator (57) and the denominator (160). Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find gcd(57,160) = 2 * 17 * 7.
