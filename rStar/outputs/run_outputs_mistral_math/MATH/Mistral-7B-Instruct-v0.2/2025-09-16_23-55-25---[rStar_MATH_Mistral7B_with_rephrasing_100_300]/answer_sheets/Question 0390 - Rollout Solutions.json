To find the minimum value of the function $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3)$, we first complete the square for $x$: $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2-3)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\left(x-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2-\\frac{9}{2})$. Then, since $-\\frac{9}{2}<0$, we take the negative of it: $-(\\frac{9}{2})=\\frac{9}{2}$. So, we need to find the square root of $\\frac{a}{2}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, so $a=\\boxed{1}$. Therefore, $a+b=1+b$. To find $b$, notice that the parabola opens downward because the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative. Thus, the minimum occurs when $x=-\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $y$, we get $y=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(-\\frac{9}{2}\\right)=\\box", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
