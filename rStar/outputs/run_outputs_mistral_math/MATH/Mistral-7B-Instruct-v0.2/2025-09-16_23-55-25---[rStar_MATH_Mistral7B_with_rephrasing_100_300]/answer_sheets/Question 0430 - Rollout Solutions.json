One way to do this is to find a common multiple of both the numerator and the denominator. The prime factors of 2 are all repeated twice, so a common multiple would be 2 multiplied by itself some number of times, i.e., 2$^m$. Since 9 is 3 times 3, another factor is 3, so we need a common multiple of 2$^m$ and 3. The least common multiple of 2$^m$ and 3 is 2$^{m+1}$, because any power of 2 raised to the next power will also be a multiple of 2, while 3 is not a multiple of 2 unless combined with an even exponent (because 3$^m$ has a remaining digit of 1 when divided by 2).
