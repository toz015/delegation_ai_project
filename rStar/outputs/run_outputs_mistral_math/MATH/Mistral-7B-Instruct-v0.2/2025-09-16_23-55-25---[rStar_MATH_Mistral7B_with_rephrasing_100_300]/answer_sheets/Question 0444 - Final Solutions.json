The probability that a point P inside a square is closer to the center than to any vertex depends on the location of P relative to the side length and the diagonal of the square.

Based on similar triangles, we have X/AD = Y/OB, so X/Y = AD/OB. But, we know that OB = OD = AD/\u221ak. Substituting this into X/Y equation gives X/Y = \u221ak.\n\nNow, since we want to compare the distances of point P from the center O and from a vertex, let's assume that P is located along the line segment AD, at a distance d from O.
