Let the points of intersection of the hyperbola and the transversal be $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ and $(\\gamma,\\delta)$. The equation of the transversal is $x=(y-k)/m$, where $m$ is the slope of one of the asymptotes ($m=2$ in this case).\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of one of the points, say $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, into the equation of the transversal, we have $\\alpha=((\\beta-k)/m)$. We also know that the distance between the two points is $d=\\sqrt{(\\alpha-\\gamma)\u00b2+((\\beta-k)\u00b2-(\\delta-k)\u00b2)\u00b2}$, so we have $\\sqrt{(\\alpha-\\gamma)\u00b2+(((\\beta-k)\u00b2-(\\delta-k)\u00b2)/\\allowbreak m\u00b2}}=d$.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The asymptotes of a hyperbola are $y = 2x - 3$ and $y = 17 - 2x.$  Also, the hyperbola passes through the point $(4,7).$  Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola.", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Since the equation of the hyperbola is not given, we cannot directly compute the distance between the foci.
