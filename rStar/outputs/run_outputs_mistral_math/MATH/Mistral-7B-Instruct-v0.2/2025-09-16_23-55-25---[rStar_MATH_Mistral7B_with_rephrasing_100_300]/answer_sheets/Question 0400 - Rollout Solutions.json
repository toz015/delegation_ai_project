Express your answer as a common fraction.", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Let's denote the radius of the smaller semicircle as $r$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AQ^2 + BQ^2 = QC^2$, where $AC$ is the diameter of the larger semicircle, $BC$ is the diameter of the smaller semicircle, and $QC = 14$. Since the circles are tangent, $AC = BC + 2r$. Substituting this into our equation, we get $r^2 + r^2 + (r+r)^2 = 14^2$. Simplifying, we obtain $2r^2 + 2r^2 + 4r^2 = 196$.
