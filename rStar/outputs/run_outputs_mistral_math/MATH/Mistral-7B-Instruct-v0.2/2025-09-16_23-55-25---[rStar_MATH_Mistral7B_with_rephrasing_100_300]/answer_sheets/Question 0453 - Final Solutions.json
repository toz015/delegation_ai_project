Condition 1: 520 students are enrolled in the 7th grade and 650 students are enrolled in the 8th grade. Condition 2: The Student Council consists of a total of 18 representatives from both grades. Question: How many representatives should the 8th grade have for a fair representation of both grades?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What proportion of students are in the 7th grade and what proportion are in the 8th grade?", "subanswer": {"text": "There are 520 students in the 7th grade and 650 students in the 8th grade. Therefore, the proportion of students in the 7th grade is $\\frac{520}{1170}$, and the proportion of students in the 8th grade is $\\frac{650}{1170}$. The answers are $\\frac{520}{1170}$ and $\\frac{650}{1170}$.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step using hint 1. Since the proportion of students in the 7th grade is $\\frac{520}{1170}$ and the proportion of students in the 8th grade is $\\frac{650}{1170}$, for a fair representation of both grades, each proportion should represent the same percentage of representatives. Let's set up a proportion:\n\n$\\frac{\\text{number of 7th grade reps}}{\\text{total number of reps}}=\\frac{520}{1170}$\n\n$\\frac{\\text{number of 8th grade reps}}{\\text{total number of reps}}=\\frac{650}{1170}$\n\nSince both sides of the equation should be equal, we have $\\frac{\\text{number of 7th grade reps}}{\\text{number of 8th grade reps}}=\\frac{520}{650}$. Cross-multiplying, we get $\\text{number of 7th grade reps}*650=\\text{number of 8th grade reps}*520$. Solving for the number of 8", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 4}]
