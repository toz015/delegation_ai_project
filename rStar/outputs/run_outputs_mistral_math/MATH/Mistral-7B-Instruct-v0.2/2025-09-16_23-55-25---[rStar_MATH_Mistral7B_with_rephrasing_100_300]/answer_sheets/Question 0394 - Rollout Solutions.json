To do this, he needs to make $(2x-y)$ squared term as small as possible without making it negative, since a negative number squared is positive. He can achieve this by making $2x-y=0$, i.e., $x=\\dfrac{y}{2}$. Now, let's check whether this $x$ value works when Brahmagupta plays optimally. If Brahmagupta chooses $y$ to maximize $z$, he would like the term $(2x-y)^2$ to be large, so he might choose a large positive value for $y$. In this case, his choice satisfies $2x-y=0$ (since $x=\\dfrac{y}{2}$), which means that Brahmagupta's optimal choice does not interfere with Archimedes' optimal choice. Therefore, Archimedes should choose $\\boxed{x=\\dfrac{y}{2}}$. The answer is: x=y/2.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
