Since the roots are distinct integers, they can be expressed as the zeros of the polynomial. Using Vieta's Formulas, we know that the sum of the roots equals $-a_{n-1}/a_n$ and the product of the roots equals $-a_0/a_n$. Since the sum of the roots is an integer, $a_{n-1}$ must be chosen such that $-a_{n-1}/a_n$ is an integer. In other words, $a_{n-1}$ and $a_n$ have a common factor. But since $a_n$ is given as a fixed integer ($2$), and since the sum of the roots must be greater than any single root ($r_1 < |a_{n-1}/a_n|$), it follows that $a_{n-1}$ and $a_n$ have a common factor greater than 1.
