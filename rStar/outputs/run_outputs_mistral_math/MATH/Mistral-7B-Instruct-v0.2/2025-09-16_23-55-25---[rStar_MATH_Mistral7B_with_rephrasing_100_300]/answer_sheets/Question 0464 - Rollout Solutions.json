According to the product rule for logarithms, $\\log_a(x) + \\log_a(y) = \\log_a(xy)$, so $\\log_6(x-y)+\\log_6(x+y)=\\log_6((x-y)(x+y))=\\log_6(x^2-(y^2))=2$. Squaring both sides, we get $x^2-(y^2)=6^2=36$. Expanding and solving for $x$: $x^2-2xy+y^2-y^2=36\\implies x^2-2xy+35=0$. Now, let's use the second equation: $\\log_y(5x)=2$. Rewriting it as an exponential equation: $5x=y^2$. Substituting the solution for $x^2-2xy+35=0$ into this equation, we have $5(x-y/2)^2=y^2\\implies (x-y/2)^2=(y/5)^2\\implies x", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
