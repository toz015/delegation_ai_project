Condition 2: The cost of painting the cubes is proportional to their surface area, and the cost of producing the concrete base is proportional to their volume. Question: How much does it cost to make a 3 inch cube?", "ost_step": {"1": "To find the cost of making a 3 inch cube, we need to calculate the cost of producing it and the cost of painting it."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's find the cost of producing a 3 inch cube. The volume of a 1 inch cube is 1 cubic inch, and the volume of a 3 inch cube is 3\u00b3 = 27 cubic inches. Therefore, the cost of producing the 3 inch cube is $27\\times\\$1.30 = \\$35.10$. Now, let's find the cost of painting the 3 inch cube. The surface area of a 1 inch cube is 6 square inches (since it has 6 faces), and the surface area of a 3 inch cube is 3\u00b3 \u00d7 6 = 54 square inches. Therefore, the cost of painting the 3 inch cube is $54\\times C$, where $C$ is the cost per square inch to paint a 1 inch cube. We don't know $C$ directly from the information provided, but we do know that $C$ is proportional to the cost of producing a 1 inch cube. So, we set up the proportion: $\\frac{C\\times6}{1} =", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
