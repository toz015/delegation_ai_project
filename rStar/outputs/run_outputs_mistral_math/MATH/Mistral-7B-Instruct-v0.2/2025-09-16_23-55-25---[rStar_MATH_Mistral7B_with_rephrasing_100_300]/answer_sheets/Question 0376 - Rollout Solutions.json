We want to find the coordinates of point $P$ that is equidistant from points $A(10,-10)$ and $O(0,0)$. Let $d$ denote the distance between $P$ and both points $A$ and $O$, i.e., $AP = OP = d$. Using the distance formula, we have $d = \\sqrt{(10-a)^2+(b+10)^2}$. Now, substitute this value into the equation of the line $y = -x + 6$: $(-x+6) = (-(10-a)+10) \\implies x = a$. Also, using the given Pythagorean equation, we have $(10-a)^2+(b+10)^2 = d^2$. Solving for $b$ in terms of $a$, we get $(b+10)^2 = d^2 - (10-a)^2 = (d^2-(10-a)^2)/1$.
