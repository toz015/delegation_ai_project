To find the remainder when a large power is divided by a small prime number, we can use the fact that any prime number larger than the base raised to some power is congruent to one of its powers modulo the prime number. Let's take the smaller exponent first: since 11 does not divide 129, the remainders when $129^{k}$ is divided by 11 do not depend on $k$. By Euler's totient theorem, $\\phi(11)=10$, so $129^{\\phi(11)}=129^{10}\\equiv 1\\pmod{11}$. Now let's consider the larger exponent. Since $38>\\log_{11}96\\approx3.4$, we know that the exponents of 11 in the prime factorization of $96^{38}$ will repeat periodically, with a period of roughly 11 logarithms. Specifically, since 3 is the largest power of 3 in the prime factorization of 96, the exponent of 11 in the prime factorization of $96^{38", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "}$will end in a sequence of digits that repeats every 3 logs of 11. Since $\\log_{11}129\\approx3.2$, the length of this sequence will be approximately $3.2\\times11\\approx35.2$. However, the last digit of any number raised to an integer power is the same as the last digit of the number itself, so the last digit of the sequence will be the same as the last digit of $96$. Since the last digit of 96 is 6, the remainder when $129^{34}96^{38}$ is divided by 11 will be the same as the remainder when $6^{2}(129^{33})(96^{37})$ is divided by 11. Now, since both $129^{33}$ and $96^{37}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 11, it follows that their product also leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 11.
