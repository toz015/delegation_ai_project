Thus, the largest possible value of $|a|+|b|+|c|$ occurs when $|b|+|c|$ is minimized. This happens when either $b=c=0$ or $b=-c$. So, the largest possible value of $|a|+|b|+|c|$ is equal to $k^2+|b|+|c|$. Now, we can use the inequality $ax^2+bx+c\\leq1$ to bound $k^2+|b|+|c|$. For $x=0$, we have $c\\leq1$, so $|c|\\leq1$.
