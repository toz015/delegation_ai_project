The length of the entire track is 400 meters. Let $l$ be the length of one side of the rectangle, and let $r$ be the radius of each semicircle. The rectangle's sides form a right triangle with the two legs being the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the hypotenuse, which represents the diameter of a semicircle, can be calculated as follows: $d^2=l^2+r^2$. The circumference of a circle is given by $C=2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the length of the semicircle. For the given track, $C=400$. Solving for $r$: $2\\pi r=400$; $r=\\frac{400}{\\pi}\\approx127.32$.

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we find $400 = 2x + 2(x+b)$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 100 - b$. As the track's width should be greater than zero, we have $b < 100$.
