The lengths of the sides of a triangle must satisfy the Triangle Inequality Theorem, which states that the length of any side of a triangle is less than the sum of the other two sides and greater than the difference between them.\n\nSo, for a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ to exist, we must have $1<\\vert x-y\\vert <\\vert x+y\\vert$. Solving this inequality, we get $0<x-y<2x+2y<3$, so $0<x-y<3x+3y<3$. Dividing both sides by 3, we get $-y<x-\\frac{1}{3}<x+\\frac{1}{3}<y$, or equivalently, $\\frac{1}{3}-y<x<\\frac{1}{3}+y$.\n\nNow, the probability that such $x$ and $y$ are chosen at random from the interval $(0,3)$ satisfies these conditions can be calculated as the area of the region bounded by these inequalities divided by the total area of the square $(0,3)\\", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
