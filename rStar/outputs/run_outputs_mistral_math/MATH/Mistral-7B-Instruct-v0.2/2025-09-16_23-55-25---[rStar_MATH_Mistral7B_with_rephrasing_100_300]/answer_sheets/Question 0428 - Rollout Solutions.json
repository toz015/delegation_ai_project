Since all the terms in the sum are positive, the minimum value of the sum occurs when each term is the smallest possible positive number.

However, since $a, b, c, d$ are all positive, we cannot make any one of them zero. Therefore, the smallest possible values of $b, c, d$ are $1, 1, 1$ respectively.
