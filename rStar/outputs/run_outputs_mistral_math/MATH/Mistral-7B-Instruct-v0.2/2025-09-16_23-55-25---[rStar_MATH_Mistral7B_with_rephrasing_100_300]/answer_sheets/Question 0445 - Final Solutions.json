Since the circle and the parabola intersect at two points, the diameter passes through those points. We can find one of the points by substituting either of the x-values we found earlier back into the equation of the circle: $$ x^2 + y^2 = 2 \\Rightarrow (0.6765)^2 + y^2 = 2 \\Rightarrow y^2 = 1.3531 $$ Take the positive root of this quadratic equation: $$ y \\approx \\sqrt{1.3531} \\approx 1.164 $$ So one point of tangency is approximately $(0.6765, 1.164)$. Since the other point of tangency lies on the parabola, we can find its $x$-coordinate by solving the equation of the parabola for $x$: $$ y^2 = 8x \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{y^2}{8} \\approx \\frac{1}{(2)^{2}} \\approx 0.25 $$ So the other point of tangency is approximately $(0.25, -6.48)$.
