The sum of all odd numbers up to 1 is 0. The next odd number is 1, so the sum after adding it is 1. The next odd number is 3, so the sum after adding it is 4. The next odd number is 5, so the sum after adding it is 9. And so on. We continue this pattern until we reach the last odd number, which is 199. Therefore, the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 199 is 1 + 3 + ... + 197 + 199 = $\\frac{1}{2}(1+199)(199)=100\\cdot199=19,900$. Now we can find the remainder when 19,900 is divided by 7 using long division or modulus operator (%). By calculating the remainder, we get $\\boxed{3}$.
