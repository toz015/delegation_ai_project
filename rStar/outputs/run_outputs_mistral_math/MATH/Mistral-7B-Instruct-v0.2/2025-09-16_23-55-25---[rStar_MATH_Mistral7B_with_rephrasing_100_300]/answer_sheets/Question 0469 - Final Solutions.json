Following the given conditions leads to the answer of 25. However, if the goal was to find the result of raising the square root of 20 to the power of 2 without following those conditions, then the correct answer would be 400 (since $\\sqrt{20}\\approx 4.472$, and $4.472^2\\approx 20.0784\\approx 400$). The answer is: 400 (if the condition is ignored).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
