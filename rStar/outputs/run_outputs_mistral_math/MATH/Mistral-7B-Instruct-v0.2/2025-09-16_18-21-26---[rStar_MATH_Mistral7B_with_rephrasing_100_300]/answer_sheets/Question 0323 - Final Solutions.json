According to Hint 1, there are $\\binom{C/2\\pi}{\\text{4}}$ possible arrangements of selecting four distinct points from a circle. However, according to Hint 2, we cannot determine the exact number of arrangements resulting in segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersecting without further information about the lengths of the chords defined by those segments.
