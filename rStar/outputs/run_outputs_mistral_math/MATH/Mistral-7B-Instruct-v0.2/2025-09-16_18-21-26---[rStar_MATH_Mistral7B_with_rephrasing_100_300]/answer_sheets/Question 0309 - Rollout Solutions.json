We know that the product of the given set of distinct positive integers equals 84. To find the prime factorization of 84, we can use the following prime factorization algorithm: 1.

If yes, multiply 2 to the power of the count of times 2 was a divisor (i.e., 2 was divided into the number). 3. If no, move to the next prime number (3, 5, etc.) and repeat the process until all the number is factored.
