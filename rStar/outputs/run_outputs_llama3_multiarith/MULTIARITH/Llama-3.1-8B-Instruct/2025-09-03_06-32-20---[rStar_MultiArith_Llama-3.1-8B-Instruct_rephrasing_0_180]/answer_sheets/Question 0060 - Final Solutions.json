However, we can't find the solution to the problem as described because it seems like we're solving for a different variable than asked (initially). Let's rephrase that. Let's assume r represents the initial number of books roger had before buying any. We can set up a formula to represent our known quantities: r - 21 + 30 = 34. Simplifying this equation will reveal what r equals. r - 21 + 30 = 34 -> r + 9 = 34 -> r = 34 - 9 -> r = 25.
