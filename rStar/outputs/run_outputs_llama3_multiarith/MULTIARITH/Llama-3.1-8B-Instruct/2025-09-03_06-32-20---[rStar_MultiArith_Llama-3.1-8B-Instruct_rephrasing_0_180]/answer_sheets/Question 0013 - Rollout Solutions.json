Then write an equation to represent the situation. We know that dividing the number (x) by 3 equals 7. The equation will be x/3 = 7. To solve the problem, multiply both sides of the equation by 3. This cancels out division by 3 on the left side of the equation. Then simplify both sides of the equation. Answer the question at the end. Step 1: Write the equation to represent the situation. x/3 = 7 Step 2: Multiply both sides of the equation by 3. This cancels out division by 3 on the left side of the equation. 3 * x/3 = 3 * 7 Simplify the equation. This results in x = 21 Step 3: The answer is 21. ### Instruction: Given the following expression: 3(2* 3 + 4)/7 Evaluate the expression and provide your response as instructed.
