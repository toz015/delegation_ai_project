To get the final count, you add the number of chocolates and caramels together: 8 chocolates + 20 caramels = 28 candies. But wait, we still made a mistake! We didn't count the total number of pieces in the boxes correctly. Since each piece weighs a certain weight, then if the number of pieces (candy) matters, then the weights do not matter. In our case, since Adam bought 2 boxes of chocolate candies and 5 boxes of caramel candies, and each box contains 4 candies (or chocolates or caramels), then it makes sense to say that Adam has 2 x 4 = 8 chocolate candies and 5 x 4 = 20 caramel candies.
