We've established earlier that Dave had a total of 36 shirts, and 20 got washed (leaving us to find how many didn't), but to clarify that, we should establish that indeed 16 shirts were LEFT UNWASHED (not not-washed). Since Dave had 36 and washed 20, there were indeed 16 that didn't get washed. This answer should remain 16 as our final calculation doesn't change anything from what was determined earlier; the correct logic remains the same.
