However, the instruction does not specify how many coloring books Faye gives away or receives.

To find out how many coloring books Faye gives away, we need to know how many she had after receiving or giving away the coloring books. But since we don't have enough information, it's difficult to determine the exact amount.\n\nIn case if you want to know the other possible scenario where Faye receives some coloring books. Let's assume she received 'x' coloring books. We can use the formula: Faye's original coloring books + new coloring books = current coloring books. As the question doesn't specify anything about how many coloring books she has currently, we can write this equation as: 34 + x = y, where y represents the current coloring books that Faye has.\n\nPlease note that without specific details on what happens next (does she give some away, keeps all), it's challenging to determine the precise number of coloring books she gives away.
