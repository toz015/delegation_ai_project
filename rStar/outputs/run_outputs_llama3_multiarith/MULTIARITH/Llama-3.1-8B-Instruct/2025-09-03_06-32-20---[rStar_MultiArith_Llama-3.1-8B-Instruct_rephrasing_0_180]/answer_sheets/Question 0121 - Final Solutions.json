To solve this problem we need to know the total number of players which is 8. We also need to know that we want to divide them up into groups of 4. Since each player can only belong to one group, we can't just keep making groups until all the players are assigned to a group as you would if you were simply dividing 8 by 4. Instead, you need to figure out how many different ways you can make 4-player groups using all the available players. The formula for this is known as combination: C(n,k)=n!/(k!(n-k)!). Where n is the total number of items and k is the size of each item. Here, n=8, since there are 8 players and k=4, since we're forming groups of 4 players. Plugging our values into the formula we get: C(8,4)=(8!)/(4!(8-4)!)=(8*7*6*5)/(4*3*2*1)=70. Therefore, there are 70 distinct groups that can be formed using the total number of players on the team.

First we need to find out how many players there are in total, which we determined is 8. We also know that the players will be grouped in fours. That means there are 8 / 4 = 2 groups. However, we cannot simply say there are 2 groups because we do not account for whether all possible combinations were considered or if any groups contain identical players (which this prompt doesn't seem to allow). Given these are 2 different sets of players (new and old), it is safe to conclude there would be distinct groups since each player is unique based on their condition as either new or returning. Since the order of the players within the groups doesn\u2019t matter and duplicates are not allowed, we calculate the number of groups through a method known as the combination formula, C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is total items, k is the size of every subset and '!' denotes factorial. Thus the total possible number of groups is C(8, 4) = 8! / [4!(8-4)!] = 70.
