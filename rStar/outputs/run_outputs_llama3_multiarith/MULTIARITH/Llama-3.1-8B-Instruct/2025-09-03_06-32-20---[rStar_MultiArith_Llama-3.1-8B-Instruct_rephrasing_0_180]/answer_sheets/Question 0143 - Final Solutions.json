However, if you combine the leftover and full sets together without considering the potential leftover cookies separately, it becomes apparent that using all types of cookies together would allow Robin to fill 18/6 = 3 bags with 11 cookies left over; but with the information from condition 2, that only whole bags are possible, makes it impossible to account for those extra 11 without creating an exception or rephrasing question constraints. Therefore, without any exception or change in question wording, Robin can only fill 8 bags because we cannot use leftover cookies in addition to full bags, leading to rephrasing our initial logic as simply adding up all full bags regardless of type: Robin can fill 23/6 = 3 full bags (noting the remainder is irrelevant here due to our inability to store leftover cookies), plus the additional 5 full bags comprised entirely of oatmeal cookies.
