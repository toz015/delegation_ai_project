But we don't know if he got any money from his mom or not. Let's just calculate the change. At first, he had 33 dollars. After spending 4 dollars, he has 33 - 4 dollars. This leaves him with 29 dollars. To find out how much money he got, let's say it was X dollars. He must have gotten 29 + 4 dollars, because 33 - (X) + 4 = 33 - X + 4 = 37 - X = 33. So, 4 + X = 33. Solving for X, we get X = 33 - 4. X = 29. But this is the amount he ends up with! We want the initial amount before the 4 dollar expenditure. So what we need to solve is 33 - X + 4 = 29.
