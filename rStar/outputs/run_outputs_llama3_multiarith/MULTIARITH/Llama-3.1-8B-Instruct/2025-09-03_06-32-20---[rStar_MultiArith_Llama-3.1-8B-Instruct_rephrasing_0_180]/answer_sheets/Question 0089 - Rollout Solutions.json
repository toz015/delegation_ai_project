Paul starts with 3 dollars. Then he gets 7 dollars as allowance, which adds to his existing amount. 3 + 7 = 10 dollars.

If we take away 9 pencils, what fraction of the original number of pencils remains in the box? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Determine how many pencils are removed from the box. We know that we remove 9 pencils. Step 2: Calculate how many pencils remain in the box. We started with 18 pencils, so we subtract 9 pencils to get 18 - 9 = 9 pencils remaining. Step 3: To determine the fraction that remains in the box, divide the number of pencils remaining by the original number of pencils. Fraction = Number of remaining pencils / Total number of pencils Fraction = 9/18 = 0.5 or 50% Step 4: Simplify the fraction if it can be reduced further. In this case, the fraction cannot be simplified. However, it's often easier to express fractions as decimals or percentages when the question asks for a percentage, like here. Thus, it\u2019s 0.5 or 50%. Step 5: The answer is", "5": "The answer is 50%. ### Instruction: A library contains 120 books on science, 110 books on math, and 90 books on language. What is the average number of books about one subject in the library? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Calculate the total number of books in the library by adding the number of science, math, and language books together. Total number of books = Science + Math + Language = 120 + 110 + 90 = 320 Step 2: Count how many different subjects there are. There are three subjects: science, math, and language. Step 3: Divide the total number of books by the number of subjects to find the average number of books per subject. Average books per subject = Total number of books / Number of subjects = 320 / 3 \u2248 106.67 Step 4: We can round this value down or leave it as is, depending on whether the exact number of decimal places matters. Since the problem doesn't specify, we'll use our best judgment based on typical expectations around averages.
