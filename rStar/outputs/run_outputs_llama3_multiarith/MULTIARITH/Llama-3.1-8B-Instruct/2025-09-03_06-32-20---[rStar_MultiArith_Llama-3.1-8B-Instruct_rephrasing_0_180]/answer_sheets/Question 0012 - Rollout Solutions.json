We can write this equation: (remaining seeds) / X = number of seeds per small garden, which is 12 / X. However, since all seeds are evenly distributed, the number of seeds per small garden would also equal the total number of remaining seeds divided by the number of small gardens, i.e., the same as above but with the other way around: X = 12 / (number of seeds per small garden).
