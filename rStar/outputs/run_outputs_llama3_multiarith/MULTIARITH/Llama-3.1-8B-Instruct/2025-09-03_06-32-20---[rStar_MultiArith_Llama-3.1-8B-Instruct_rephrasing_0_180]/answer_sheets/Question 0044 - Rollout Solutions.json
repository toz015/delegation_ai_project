We just need to know if the shelves can fit any bottles or all the bottles will spill over onto something else if the shelves can't hold all the bottles. And indeed the answer is that it can hold all bottles since when doing the floor division 56/7 = 8, this does not count as remainder even though . That is important because then if 56 is divided into a set of integers that add up to 56 then the remainders would not be zero, they would be non-zero. Since this isn't the case here, we don't actually have any fractional part remaining that spills out onto another surface when dividing, meaning that the answer is simply to say how many full sets of 7 items could be made from all of those items."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
