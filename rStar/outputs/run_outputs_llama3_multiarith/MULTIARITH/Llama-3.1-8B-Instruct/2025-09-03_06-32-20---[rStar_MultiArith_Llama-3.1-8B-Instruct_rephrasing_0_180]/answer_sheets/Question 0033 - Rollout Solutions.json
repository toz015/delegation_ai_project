So 5+9*4=41 and 5 is less than 41 but greater than 36. But that isn't what we want, we want to know how many total groups we can make, so if we set up the inequality 9x <=40 we can solve for x (inequality because there will be groups with less people if one person doesn't fit). So we can use integer division, 40 divided by 9 is approximately 4.444... This means there can be 4 full groups of 9 girls, leaving us with 4 girls leftover that don't fit in any groups.
