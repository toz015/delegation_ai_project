There were 18 pink plastic flamingos left after 1/3 were removed. This means that there were initially 3/3 or all 18 pink plastic flamingos that could potentially be painted white and added back onto the lawn. Since exactly 1/3 were taken out, that would mean that 2/3 or 12 of the original pink plastic flamingos were not removed, and thus were not painted and replaced. That leaves 6 pink plastic flamingos that were painted white and added back onto the lawn, along with the new batch of 18 pink plastic flamingos added later. To find how many white plastic flamingos were added back onto the lawn, we need to add up these two sources. The 6 white plastic flamingos are found by calculating the proportion of flamingos that were removed and repainted (1/3), then multiplying by the number of initial pink plastic flamingos (18). So, 1/3 x 18 = 6 white plastic flamingos. The other source is the new batch of 18 pink plastic flamingos added later. By subtracting the pink plastic flamingos from the new batch, we can find out how many white plastic flamingos were added back onto the lawn in this second source. In other words, if the total number of pink plastic flamingos in the new batch was X, then we can write the equation: X - (X/3) = 18. Solving for X gives X = 36 pink plastic flamingos. Subtracting the pink plastic flamingos that were painted white (6) leaves us with 30 pink plastic flamingos (from the 36-pink-flamingo batch), which, when combined with the 6 painted white flamingos, gives us a grand total of 36 white plastic flamingos.

First we find out how many pink flamingos Sue had when it all started on Friday. It was 18. After Saturday, \u2154 of those were taken away. That would leave 11 pink ones (\u2154 of 18). The other \u2153 (about 6) were repainted. So on Sunday morning, Sue had 11 pink and 6 white flamingos. By Sunday afternoon, she had 11 pink and another 18 pink, making a total of 39 pink flamingos. Let's call the number of white flamingos W. We don't know what that is yet because we haven't counted them since the repainting. We can figure it out like this: The total number of flamingos is 39 pink plus W white flamingos. This equals the original 18 pink flamingos plus the new 18 pink plus the 6 repainted white flamingos. Let's set up an equation: 39 = 18 + 18 + 6. We can solve for W by finding out how much W adds to the total number of white", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Sue lives in a fun neighborhood.
