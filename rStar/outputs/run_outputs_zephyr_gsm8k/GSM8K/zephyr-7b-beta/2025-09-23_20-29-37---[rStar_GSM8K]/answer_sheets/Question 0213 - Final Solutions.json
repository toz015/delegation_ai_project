That leaves us with 500 - 250 = 250 more customers. Those 250 more customers are spread over however many days remain until the end of the third day (we don't yet know how many). To make this calculation easier, let's say the third day starts right away (so there is only one day remaining), and we calculate how many customers Sloane would need on that one remaining day.
