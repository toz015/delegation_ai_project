But since we know Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, this also equals 1 page per minute. So 16.67 pages per minute is 2 times as fast. Therefore, Mike could reply to the 100 pages in half the time, or 8 minutes instead of 16. This means Mike used to send out 10 letters a week, or 2 letters a week per person he was pen pals with. Now let's calculate what happens when he stops being pen pals with 2 people. Since each person sends 2 letters a week, each week Mike receives 2 fewer letters. So he receives 3 letters from each remaining", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. To summarize, we know that Mike spent 8 minutes responding to all 10 letters, and it takes him 6 minutes to write a page. Before he stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he wrote for 6 minutes to write a page, and took another 2 minutes to respond to all 10 letters for a total of 8 minutes. Now, he writes for 6 minutes per page and spends an additional 3 minutes per letter responding. The number of letters he has to respond to each week is now three less than it was before, because he lost two pen pals who used to send him two letters each per week. That's a total of 9 fewer letters to respond to each week. However, it still takes him 2 minutes per letter to respond, so the total time he spends responding to letters is now: 3 * 2 = 6 minutes fewer per week. The formula to find the total number of minutes Mike spends writing and responding to letters is: Number of pages written per week times 6 minutes per page plus total number of letters responded to times 2 minutes per letter. Before he stopped being pen pals with 2", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
