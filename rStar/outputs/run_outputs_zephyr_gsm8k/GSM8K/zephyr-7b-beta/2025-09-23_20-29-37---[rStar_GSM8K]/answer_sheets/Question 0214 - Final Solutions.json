We'll use \"LP\" to denote the volume of water in the larger pool and \"SP\" to denote the volume of water in the smaller pool. By condition 1, we know LP_4 = 2SP_4. By condition 3, we also know LP = 4SP. Combining these two, we get LP_4 = 8SP_4. By condition 2, we know that the leakage rates for both pools are 4 gallons/minute. Since the sum of the leakages from both pools is zero (because no water is being added), the leakage rate for the larger pool is LP_leakage = -4LP/LP = -4, and the leakage rate for the smaller pool is SP_leakage = -4SP/SP = -4. The total volume of water in both pools four minutes ago was LP_4 + SP_4. This volume is decreasing at a rate of -4LP_4/min - 4SP_4/min = -8(LP + SP)_4/min.

Using our previous formula, the total volume of water in both pools now is LP + SP. Four minutes ago, the total volume was LP_4 + SP_4. The leakage rate for the larger pool is LP_leakage = -4LP/LP, and the leakage rate for the smaller pool is SP_leakage = -4SP/SP. Using this information, we can calculate the current leakage rate for both pools together, which is -8(LP + SP)/(LP + SP) = -8. Therefore, we have d(LP+SP)/dt = -8(-). From this, we can calculate how long it takes for both pools to drain completely, using the initial volumes LP_0 and SP_0. Integrating this gives us LP_t + SP_t = LP_0 + SP_0 - 8t. But LP_0 = 4SP_0, so LP_t = 3SP_t. Therefore, SP_t/(LP_t + SP_t) = SP_t/(3SP_t + SP_t) = SP_t/(4SP_", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 12}]
