There were 18 pink plastic flamingos left after 1/3 were removed. This means that there were initially 3/3 or all 18 pink plastic flamingos that could potentially be painted white and added back onto the lawn. Since exactly 1/3 were taken out, that would mean that 2/3 or 12 of the original pink plastic flamingos were not removed, and thus were not painted and replaced. That leaves 6 pink plastic flamingos that were painted white and added back onto the lawn, along with the new batch of 18 pink plastic flamingos added later. To find how many white plastic flamingos were added back onto the lawn, we need to add up these two sources. The 6 white plastic flamingos are found by calculating the proportion of flamingos that were removed and repainted (1/3), then multiplying by the number of initial pink plastic flamingos (18). So, 1/3 x 18 = 6 white plastic flamingos. The other source is the new batch of 18 pink plastic flamingos added later. By subtracting the pink plastic flamingos from the new batch, we can find out how many white plastic flamingos were added back onto the lawn in this second source. In other words, if the total number of pink plastic flamingos in the new batch was X, then we can write the equation: X - (X/3) = 18. Solving for X gives X = 36 pink plastic flamingos. Subtracting the pink plastic flamingos that were painted white (6) leaves us with 30 pink plastic flamingos (from the 36-pink-flamingo batch), which, when combined with the 6 painted white flamingos, gives us a grand total of 36 white plastic flamingos.

We know that there were initially 18 pink flamingos, 6 were painted white, and then another batch of 18 pink flamingos was added.

Using the calculation we did in Hint 2, we know that there were 36 white flamingos added back onto the lawn during the second source. If we let W be the number of white flamingos that were painted and replaced during the first source, then the 36 white flamingos added during the second source would be the remaining 36 - W white flamingos from the second batch.
