In condition 1, Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a matching belt for $32.00. In total, she needs $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00. In condition 2, she earns $8.00 per hour working part-time. This means, if she works for 'x' hours, she earns 'x' * $8.00 = $8x dollars. To find out how many hours she needs to complete before she has enough money, we can write it as an equation: $8x = $352.00. Solve the equation for 'x'. Divide both sides by 8: x = $352.00 / $8.00 = $44.00 hours.

That's a total of 320 + 32 = 352 dollars. If she earns 8 dollars per hour, she earns 8 dollars for every hour she works. Let's say it takes h hours for her to have enough money. This means she earned 8 * h dollars during those h hours. We can set up an equation to find out what value of h will get us 352: 8h = 352. Dividing both sides by 8 gets us h = 44.
