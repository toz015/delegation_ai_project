She's already taken 5 tests worth of grades (which are a, b, c, d, and 86). By allowing a score to be replaced, Brinley has reduced her number of scores to add up by one, resulting in her new average formula being (a + b + c + d + 86 - replacementScore + scoreOnSixthTest) / 5. Notice that I've separated the replacementScore out and added it back in with the final score of the sixth test. Again, we don't know which score was replaced, so let's assume they were all replaced with an h. That means the formula becomes: (a + b + c + d + 86 + h - h + scoreOnSixthTest) / 5. Now, to find the value of 'h', we have to look at her current average when she hasn't replaced any scores: (a + b + c + d + e + f) / 6. Subtracting the last term (f) from both sides of the equation, we have: ((a + b + c + d + e) / 5) - ((e + f) / 6) = (a + b + c + d + e - 6ef) / 30. Now, since we want to simplify the expression involving the replacement score (h), we substitute the expression from Step 1 to obtain: (a + b + c + d + e + h) / 5 = (a + b + c + d + e - 6ef) / 30.

For each exam, the score and weight (i.e., value) are both equal to 1. So the weighted average formula is: Weighted Average = Sum_i(Score_i*Weight_i) / Total Weight. Applying the formula, we obtain: Weighted Average = (89*1 + 71*1 + 92*1 + 100*1 + 86*1) / (1+1+1+1+1) = 90.6%. Since we want Brinley's average score to be 93%, and we know that the weights of the sixth exam will be 0.9 due to exclusion of one exam, the amount of points Brinley needs to earn on the final exam to reach an average score of 93% is calculated by the following steps.\n1.
