Let's call the number of lines in the second scene y. From the hint, we know that y = 54 + 6 = 60, and that four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. Since the ratio of Sean's lines to all lines in the second scene is 4/5, we can use this proportion to relate the number of lines that Sean has to memorize in the second scene to the total number of lines in the second scene, like so: 4/5 = (number of Sean's lines in second scene) / y. Using algebra, we can set up another equation relating the total number of lines that Sean has to memorize to the total number of lines in both scenes combined, like so: Total number of Sean's lines = (number of Sean's lines in first scene) + (number of Sean's lines in second scene). Now, we just need to substitute our values into these equations to find the total number of lines that Sean has to memorize. Let's plug in our values for x, y,", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
