Since we know the number of stars in the top three rows (24) and the bottom two rows (12), we can easily see that the middle row(s) must also have 24 - 12 = 12 stars. Using the fact that there are three rows with eight stars each, this tells us that there are 3 * 8 = 24 stars above the middle row(s). Similarly, since the bottom two rows each have six stars, there are 2 * 6 = 12 stars below the middle row(s). Hence, there must be 12 stars in the middle row(s). Consequently, the number of rows with five stars is equal to the total number of rows minus the number of rows with more than five stars. This latter quantity is found by multiplying the number of stars in each of the other types of rows by the number of such rows: 3 * 8 = 24 stars for the top three rows, 3 * 6 = 18 stars for the second three rows, and 2 * 8 = 16 stars for the next-to-bottom two rows.

We can solve this equation for the unknown quantities to give: 12x + 6y = 12. The number of rows with exactly five stars is y. Thus, we must now determine y. To do this, recall that y is also the number of rows between the last row with six stars and the bottom two rows that each have five stars. However, the distance between these rows is not specified explicitly. If we assume that they are equally spaced, then y is just the difference between their row numbers: Y = bottom row # - middle row # - (last row # with six stars). But, what are the row numbers?

But, to find out their row numbers, we make an assumption that the rows with eight stars occur above the rows with five stars, with some intervening rows with six stars. Then, we can say that the last row with six stars has row number (number of rows with five stars) + (number of rows with six stars) + (number of rows with eight stars). By symmetry, however, this is the same as saying that the penultimate row has row number (number of rows with five stars) + (number of rows with six stars) + (number of rows with eight stars) - 1. Letting x and y be the number of rows with five stars and the number of rows with exactly five stars between these two rows, respectively, we can now set up the following linear system for x, y, and z: (number of rows with five stars) + (number of rows with six stars) + (number of rows with eight stars) = Total number of rows; (number of rows with five stars) + (number of rows with six stars) + (number of rows with eight stars) - 1 = Penultimate row #; And finally, y = Bottom row # - Penultimate row # - Last row with six stars #.
