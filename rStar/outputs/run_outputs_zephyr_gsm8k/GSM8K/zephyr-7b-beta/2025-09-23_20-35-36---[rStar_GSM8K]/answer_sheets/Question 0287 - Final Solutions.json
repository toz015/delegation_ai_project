As there are z rows with five stars, and the remaining rows are made up of 8 stars and 6 stars. Let's denote the number of rows having 8 stars by 'x' and the number of rows having 6 stars by 'y'. Using the same reasoning, we get, 8*x+6*(y-x)+5*z=number of total stars. Simplifying this equation, we get, y=(80*z-32*z)/15. But, we know that y cannot be negative. From our previous result, we know that, y<=32, when z<=4. As we want an integer value of y, we take the maximum possible value of 'z', i.e., z=4. If we assume 'z' as anything greater than four, then y becomes fractional, which isn't feasible. Hence, 'z' can never be greater than 4. Using the value of 'z' in the expression for 'y', we get, y=0. Therefore, there are no rows containing only five stars, hence the answer is zero. Note that our assumption about x, y, and z being integers might not always hold true, so the calculations done above may be wrong, if any assumption fails. However, in this case, the assumptions hold true, and our calculations are correct. I'd like to see some diagrammatical representation of the flag based on the conditions given in the question.
