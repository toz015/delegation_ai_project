For Marco, we'd like to find out his age in 10 years, but we don't know it yet. However, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will still be 20, because they started at 20 together. In 10 years, Mico's age would be x+10, and Marco's age would be different than y. Let's call it y': x+10 + y' = 20. Now, instead of calling it y', we'll simply call it y again, because we're talking about Marco's age in 10 years from now. So, here's our new equation: x + 10 + y = 20. This simplifies to: y = 20 - x - 10 = 10 - x. Now we can add up their ages. Mico's age would be x+10, and Marco's age would be 10-x, so when we add them together, it should equal what we expect. Indeed, Mico's age plus Marco's age 10 years later is exactly 20: (x+10) + (10-x) = 20.
