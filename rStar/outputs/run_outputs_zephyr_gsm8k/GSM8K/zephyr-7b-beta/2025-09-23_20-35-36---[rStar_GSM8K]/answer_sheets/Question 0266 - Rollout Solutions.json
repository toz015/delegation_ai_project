According to condition 1, Mr. Tan received $400 000 from the sale of his house. According to condition 2, transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. So transfer fees are 3% of $400 000, which is $12 000. According to condition 3, a brokerage fee equals 5% of the selling price. So the brokerage fee is 5% of $400 000, which is $20 000. From condition 4, we know that Mr. Tan still owes $250 000 on the mortgage of the house being sold. By solving the system of equations, we can find out how much money Mr. Tan actually receives in his pocket. First, let's calculate the total expenses (transfer fees + brokerage fees + remaining mortgage amount). Total expenses = transfer fees + brokerage fees + remaining mortgage amount.
