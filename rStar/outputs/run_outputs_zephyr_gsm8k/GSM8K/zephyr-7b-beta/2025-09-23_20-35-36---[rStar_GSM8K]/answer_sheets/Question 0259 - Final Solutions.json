Next, we need to calculate how many bananas both of them have. Since Jamal has half as many bananas as Andrea, and Andrea has x bananas, then Jamal has (x / 2) bananas. Jamal also has 4 more apples than bananas, so his net apple count is (x / 2) - 4 apples. Using the fact that Jamal's apples plus bananas equal Andrea's apples, we get the following system: Andrea's apples = (x + 8) (x / 2) - 4 (x / 2) (This calculates the net apple count for Jamal and adds it to his bananas.)

We'll start with Andrea's apples. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, which means Andrea's apples minus Jamal's apples equals 8. Let's call Andrea's apples X and Jamal's apples J. That's X - J = 8. Now let's find how many bananas Andrea has. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which means Andrea's bananas divided by 2 equals Jamal's bananas. Let's call Andrea's bananas B and Jamal's bananas K. That's B / 2 = K. But we already know how many bananas Jamal has. Remember that Jamal has half as many bananas as Andrea. So we want to express K in terms of X and J instead. To do this, let's set up our equations again: B / 2 = K (B = 2K) and X - J = 8.

From condition 1, we can say that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Let's call the number of apals Andrea has X, so Jamal has X - 8. From condition 2, we know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal does. So Andrea's number of bananas is half of Jamal's number of bananas, which is (X - 8) / 2. Now let's use condition 3 to make things easier. From condition 3, we know that the difference between the number of bananas and the number of apples in Jamal's case is 4. This means that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. To find out how many bananas Jamal has, we add the number of apples to 4. Since we already have expressions for both numbers, we can substitute these into the expression for jamal's bananas, getting (X - 8) + 4.

Solving this system of equations requires finding values of X that satisfy both equations simultaneously. Notice that the second equation implies X = 8, because if X is 8 or larger, there won't be enough bananas left over to account for all the extra bananas. On the other hand, if X is smaller than 8, then Andrea would have fewer bananas than Jamal does, contradicting condition 2. Thus X must be exactly 8, and consequently, Andrea has 0 bananas. However, since we found that Andrea has no bananas, condition 2 cannot hold true. Therefore, it seems that our initial set of conditions leads to a logical inconsistency, meaning that there is no solution satisfying all conditions simultaneously. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I suggest checking your initial conditions to ensure that they are mutually consistent.
