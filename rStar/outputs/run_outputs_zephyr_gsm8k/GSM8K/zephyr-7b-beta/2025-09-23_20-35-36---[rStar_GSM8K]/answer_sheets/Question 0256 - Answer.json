{"id": 256, "problem": "Brady is counting the money in his piggy bank. He has 100 pennies, 40 nickels, 20 dimes, and 40 pieces of dollar bills. How much does Brady have in his piggy bank in dollars?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.\nSince nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.\nSince a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.\nSo, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.\nSince a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.\nThus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.\n#### 45", "gold_answer": "45"}
