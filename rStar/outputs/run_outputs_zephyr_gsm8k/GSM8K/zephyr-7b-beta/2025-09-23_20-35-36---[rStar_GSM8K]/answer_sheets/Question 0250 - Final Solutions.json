From Condition 2, we know that the gender distribution is half boys and half girls. That means for each class, there are 10 boys and 10 girls. To find the number of boys in the last class, we don't know the exact value of the girls in the last class, but since we know that the number of girls in the first class is 15 and in the second class is 12, and there are half as many girls in the last class, there would be 30-15-12=8 girls remaining. Thus, using Condition 2, the number of boys in the last class is 10 less than the number of girls (since the ratio is still half boys and half girls). Therefore, the number of boys in the last class is 8-10=-2, which is not possible since we cannot have negative numbers. Hence, the number of boys in the last class is actually 10 boys.
