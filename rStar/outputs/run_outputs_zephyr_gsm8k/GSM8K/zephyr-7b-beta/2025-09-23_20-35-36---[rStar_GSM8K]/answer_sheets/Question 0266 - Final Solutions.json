Since transfer fees equal 3% of the selling price, the transfer fees are equivalent to $12 000 ($400 000 x .03).\n\nDetermine the amount paid for the brokerage fees using condition 3. Brokerage fees equal 5% of the selling price, which amounts to $20 000 ($400 000 x .05).\n\nNow, calculate the balance owed on Mr. Tan\u2019s mortgage based on condition 4. Subtract the remaining mortgage amount of $250 000 from the selling price of $400 000, which equals $150 000. Thus, Mr. Tan still owes $250 000 on the mortgage of the house being sold.\n\nSubtract the sum of the transfer fees and brokerage fees from the original sales price.

According to condition 1, Mr. Tan received $400 000 from the sale of his house. According to condition 2, transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. So transfer fees are 3% of $400 000, which is $12 000. According to condition 3, a brokerage fee equals 5% of the selling price. So the brokerage fee is 5% of $400 000, which is $20 000. From condition 4, we know that Mr. Tan still owes $250 000 on the mortgage of the house being sold. By solving the system of equations, we can find out how much money Mr. Tan actually receives in his pocket. First, let's calculate the total expenses (transfer fees + brokerage fees + remaining mortgage amount). Total expenses = transfer fees + brokerage fees + remaining mortgage amount.

Since we're looking for the amount of money Mr. Tan gets after selling his house, paying transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining mortgage amount, let's call this amount X. Using condition 1, we know that X plus the transfer fees and brokerage fees comes out of the sale price of $400 000. The transfer fees are $12 000 (as you found), so X minus $12 000 is $400 000 minus the brokerage fees. That's where condition 3 comes into play. We find out that the brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, which means they are $20 000 (or $400 000 * 0.05). Subtracting these from the original $400 000, we get $380 000.
