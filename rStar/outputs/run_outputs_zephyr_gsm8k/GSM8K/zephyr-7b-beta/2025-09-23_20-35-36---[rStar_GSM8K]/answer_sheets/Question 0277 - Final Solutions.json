To dig 30 small holes would take 3 minutes per hole times 30 holes which equals 90 minutes or 1.5 hours.

To find out how long it takes him to finish both tasks we add up the time taken for digging both the small and large holes.

First we need to find out how long it takes Matthew to dig one small hole. Since each small hole takes less time than each large hole, let's say it takes him x minutes to dig a small hole.

To dig 30 small holes, it will take Matthew 30 * 3 = 90 minutes. And to dig 15 large holes, it will take Matthew 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.

Using our knowledge from hint 1, we know that it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole. Based on condition 1, we also know that it takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole. We can see that it takes Matthew three times longer to dig one large hole than it does to dig one small hole. Let's create a ratio to help us understand this relationship: 3 minutes is to 1 small hole as X minutes is to 1 large hole. Cross multiply: 3 * X = 10 * 1. Divide both sides by X: 3 = 10.
