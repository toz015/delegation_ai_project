Susan earned 5 dollars for every 10 minute segment she worked. Let's assume she earns q dollars per hour (q is the amount she earns per hour). 10 minutes is 0.1667 hours, or roughly 1/6th of an hour. In 1 hour, she would earn 5 times as much as she earns in 10 minutes (since she earns the same rate per time unit). So, we can say q = 0.1667 * 5 = 0.833 dollars per minute. Since Susan worked for 2.5 hours in total, she earned 2.5 hours worth of income. 2.5 hours is 2.5 * 60 minutes, or 150 minutes. 150 minutes times our per-minute earning rate gives us her total earnings for the task. 150 * 0.833 dollars per minute is 125 dollars.

Let's call this break time t. During this time period, Susan works for (10*2) - 30 = 50 minutes per day. This means she must also sleep for 24 hours minus the time worked and break time: 24 - 10*(2+t/60) = 540 - 120(2+t/60) = 420 - 72t/30. Now note that when t=0, this becomes exactly what we want: 420. Also note that if t gets too large (> 24*60), then Susan would be working at negative time! Since we know that cannot happen, it must be that the largest possible value for t is 720 (i.e., 12 hours). Therefore, t must satisfy 0 <= t <= 720. This means that the work time must also satisfy 0 <= (10*2) - 30 - t <= 720 (note that this upper bound on work time will again be too small if t is close to its lower bound). In other words, Susan works between 60 and 720 minutes, or 1 and 12 hours. We can safely say that Susan works for at least 60 minutes, so the upper bound above is our maximum work time.
