From condition 1, we know that the real estate agent spends $5 per newspaper ad and $75 per television ad. Condition 2 tells us that the real estate agent buys a total of 50 newspaper ads. This means that the total amount he spends on newspaper ads is $5 times the number of newspaper ads. Since he bought 50, the total is $250. Condition 3 says that the real estate agent buys a total of 15 television ads. Again, this means that the total amount he spends on television ads is $75 times the number of TV ads, or $1,125 in this case. Putting it all together, the total amount spent on buying all the ads is the sum of what he spent on newspaper ads plus what he spent on TV ads: $250 (newspapers) + $1,125 (TV) = $1,375.
