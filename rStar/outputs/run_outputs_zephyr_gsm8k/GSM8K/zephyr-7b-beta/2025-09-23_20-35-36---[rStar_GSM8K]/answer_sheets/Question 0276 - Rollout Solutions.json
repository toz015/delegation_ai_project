Condition 5: The remaining cards are then subjected to condition 6, which reveals that 5/8 (or 62.5%) of these cards bear the letter C. Condition 7 describes what happens to the remaining cards \u2013 those without the letters A or B \u2013 namely, that they contain the letter D. Question: How many cards ultimately have the letter D on them?", "ost_step": {"1": "Begin with the total number of cards, which is 80 as per the first condition.", "2": "As per condition 2, we know that 32% of these 80 cards have the letter 'A'. We can find this percentage in decimal form - 0.32. Multiplying it with the number of cards, we get the number of cards having 'A', which would be 0.32 x 80 = 25.6. Since we cannot have decimals, let us round off the number to 26 cards."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Now, after removing these cards with 'A', we are left with 80 - 26 = 54 cards. Out of these 54 cards, condition 4 tells us that 50% of these cards have 'B'. So, we get 0.50 x 54 = 27 cards with 'B'. These cards are further processed as per condition 6. According to this condition, 62.5% of the remaining cards have 'C'. Using this figure, we get 0.625 x (54 - 27) = 24.375 cards having 'C'. Rounding off once again, we have 24 cards having 'C'. Now, according to condition 7, we need to remove the cards bearing 'A' and 'B' and check the number of remaining cards that have 'D'. As per our calculations, we have removed 26 cards with 'A' and 27 cards with 'B'. So, we are left with 54 - (26 + 27) = 21 cards. Out of these 21 cards, condition 7 says that all of them contain 'D", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
