Then Mr. Sylas bought 40 cows and distributed them evenly among the existing 20 stalls, so that each stall now contains both old and new cows. Step 4: In order for each of the 20 stalls now to contain an equal number of both old and new cows, we need to split up the original 200 cows into groups of 20 cows and then add on the additional 40 cows that Mr. Sylas purchased and distributed evenly. Therefore, in total, each stall now contains (20 old cows) + (1 new cow) = 21 cows. Step 5: To find the number of cows in 8 of those stalls, we simply multiply the total number of cows per stall (which we found was 21) times the number of stalls we want (which is 8).
