Since both dogs and Grey seals can be trained to respond to a bell, we need to consider their natural inclination towards responding to auditory stimuli without formal training.

Grey seals are wild marine mammals that can display some level of intelligence and learning abilities, similar to dogs. They have been observed interacting with humans in various settings, including rehabilitation centers and zoos.
