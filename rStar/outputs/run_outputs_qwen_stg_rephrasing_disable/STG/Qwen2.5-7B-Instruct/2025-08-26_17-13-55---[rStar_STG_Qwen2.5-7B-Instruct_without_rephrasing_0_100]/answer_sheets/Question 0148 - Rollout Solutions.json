Hypothermia occurs when a person's core body temperature falls below 35.0\u00b0C. Triton, a moon of Neptune, has an extremely cold average surface temperature, far below this threshold. Regardless of the type of clothing worn, including a zoot suit, a human on Triton would be at severe risk for hypothermia due to the extreme cold temperatures. The answer is: true. The extreme cold on Triton would certainly cause hypothermia concerns for any human wearing a zoot suit or any other form of clothing. The answer is: true.You are given a sentence in Spanish.
