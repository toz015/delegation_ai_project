First, we need to determine how much it would cost to fund Micronesia's debt for a decade. According to Hint 1, Micronesia's total external debt is approximately $879 million.

However, the problem doesn't specify whether only the principal amount needs to be funded or if the interest is included, so let's focus solely on the principal amount for simplicity.\n\nNow, we compare this amount to Michael Bloomberg's net worth.
