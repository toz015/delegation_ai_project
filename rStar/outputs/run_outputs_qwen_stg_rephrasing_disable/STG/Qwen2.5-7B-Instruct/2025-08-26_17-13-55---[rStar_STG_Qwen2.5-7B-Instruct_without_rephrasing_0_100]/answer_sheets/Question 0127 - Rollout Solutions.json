Her French heritage means that some Scottish people may be descended from her, indirectly through shared ancestry. But this does not change the fact that they are primarily of Scottish descent. Thus, French ancestry affects only part of the gene pool of individuals descended from Mary, Queen of Scots. The answer is: false. The primary statement about descent being mainly Scottish remains accurate. The French element is a subset rather than defining the entire descent. \n\nThe answer is: false. Your original interpretation implied a broader claim about all Scottish descent being affected, which is not correct; it only impacts those directly related through Mary's lineage.
