Whole genome sequencing is a powerful technique used to determine the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome. However, when it comes to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, the virus contains RNA, not DNA. Therefore, traditional whole genome sequencing cannot directly analyze SARS-CoV-2. Instead, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or RT-qPCR (reverse transcription quantitative PCR) are commonly used techniques for studying SARS-CoV-2. Hence, whole genome sequencing alone cannot be used for COVID-19. The answer is: false.You are given a sentence in Japanese.
