Macaques are small primates with a body weight ranging from about 5 to 30 kilograms (11 to 66 lbs). On the other hand, elephants are massive animals that can weigh several thousand pounds and stand over ten feet tall at the shoulder. This size difference gives elephants a clear physical advantage in combat. Additionally, elephants possess strong tusks and trunks, which serve as formidable offensive and defensive weapons. In contrast, male macaques primarily rely on social bonds, group cooperation, physical strength, and sharp canine teeth for defense.
