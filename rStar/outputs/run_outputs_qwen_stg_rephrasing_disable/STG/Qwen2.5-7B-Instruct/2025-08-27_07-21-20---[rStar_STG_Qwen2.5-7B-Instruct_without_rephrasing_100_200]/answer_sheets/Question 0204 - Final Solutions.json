Drummers do not use strings, unlike guitarists or banjo players. Instead, they rely on drumheads, which are stretched over the drum shells. Drumheads can wear out due to frequent use, environmental conditions, and other factors, affecting the sound quality. To maintain optimal performance, drummers may need to replace these worn-out drumheads.
