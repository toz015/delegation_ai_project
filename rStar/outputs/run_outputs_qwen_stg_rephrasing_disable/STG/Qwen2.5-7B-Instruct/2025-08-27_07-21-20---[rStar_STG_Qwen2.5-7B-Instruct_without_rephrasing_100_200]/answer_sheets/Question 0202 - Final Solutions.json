The Islamic tradition recognizes a large number of prophets, far exceeding those mentioned in the Old Testament, which includes Solomon as one among many kings of Judah. Since Solomon is only one of the many prophets recognized by Islam, and considering that there are numerous other prophets also recognized by Islam, he would not constitute a disproportionately high percentage of these prophetic figures relative to the kings of Judah.
