The Louvre is a historic site and art museum primarily constructed from materials such as stone, specifically limestone and marble, along with some sections made of metal and glass. Nitric acid is a strong acid that has corrosive properties, which can damage certain materials. Limestone and marble are both types of sedimentary rocks composed mainly of calcium carbonate, which can be dissolved by acids like nitric acid over time. While it might take considerable time and quantity of nitric acid to cause significant damage, theoretically, it could potentially break down parts of the Louvre built from limestone and marble. Sections made of metal and glass are more resistant to nitric acid but still susceptible to corrosion under specific conditions. Therefore, nitric acid has the potential to cause damage to the Louvre, though the extent would depend on the concentration, application method, and duration of exposure. The answer is: true.

Nitric acid is a highly corrosive chemical that can damage or destroy materials through chemical reactions. While parts of the Louvre are indeed made from stone like limestone and marble, which can react with nitric acid, the structure also includes sections made of metal and glass. Metal can corrode when exposed to nitric acid, and glass may etch or crack. Therefore, nitric acid has the potential to significantly damage or even break parts of the Louvre, though it would likely require extensive exposure and specific concentrations of the acid.
