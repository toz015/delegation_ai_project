Hanging involves suspending a person using a ligature around their neck. Initially, when the body is suspended, blood flow to the brain is restricted, causing loss of consciousness very quickly. This leads to the terminal stage, which includes jerking movements due to reflex actions, followed by muscle relaxation and eventual flaccidity as death occurs. These jerking movements occur during the transition from life to death. Therefore, bodies do move during hanging. The answer is: true. The answer is: true.You are given a sentence in Arabic.
