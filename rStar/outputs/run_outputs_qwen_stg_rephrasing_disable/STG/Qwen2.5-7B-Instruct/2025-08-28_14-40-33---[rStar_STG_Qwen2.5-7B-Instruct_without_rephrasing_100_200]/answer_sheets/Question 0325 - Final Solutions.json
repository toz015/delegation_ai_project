Anchovies primarily inhabit temperate and tropical coastal waters worldwide. These habitats include both colder and warmer regions. Colder water temperatures can support anchovy populations due to suitable conditions for their metabolism and reproduction. However, they also thrive in warmer waters within their habitat range. Since the hint indicates that anchovies can be found in both colder and warmer waters, we cannot definitively say that more anchovies live in colder temperature waters than in warmer ones. The answer is: false. Note that this is based on the available information and may vary depending on specific environmental factors and local populations. The precise distribution of anchovies across different water temperatures is complex and can fluctuate. To provide a definitive answer, we would need more detailed data on global anchovy distributions. However, given the provided statement about their range, the most accurate conclusion is that they do not exclusively favor colder over warmer waters.
