Do you need a farmer to make a circuit board?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Circuit boards are electronic components manufactured using highly specialized processes involving chemistry, engineering, and materials science. They are produced in factories equipped with advanced machinery and clean rooms, far removed from agricultural practices. Farmers do not play any role in the manufacturing process of circuit boards. Therefore, you do not need a farmer to make a circuit board. The answer is: false.
