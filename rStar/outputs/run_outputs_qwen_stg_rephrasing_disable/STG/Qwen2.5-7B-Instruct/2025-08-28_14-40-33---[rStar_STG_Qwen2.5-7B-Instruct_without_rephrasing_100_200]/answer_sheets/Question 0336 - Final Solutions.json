Woodcocks, while capable flyers, are more limited in terms of speed and maneuverability due to their ground-based lifestyle and less specialized wings and body structure.\n\nTherefore, in a hypothetical race between a Swallow and an American Woodcock, the Swallow would almost certainly outperform the Woodcock based on its superior flight adaptations.
