Provide a detailed answer to the following question: Can dogs drink cow's milk without adverse effects?\nDogs drinking cow's milk can lead to digestive issues. This is because dogs lack the lactose enzyme needed to properly digest lactose, which is a sugar found in milk. Lactose intolerance in dogs can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and vomiting. Additionally, some breeds may be more prone to these reactions due to their genetics. It's important to note that while not all dogs will have negative reactions to cow's milk, it is generally best to avoid giving it to them regularly. Some alternative dairy products, like lactose-free milk, may be safer options if you want to give your dog something similar. However, it's always best to consult with a veterinarian about introducing any new food items to your pet's diet.\nThe answer is: False.\n\nTo provide more details on why this is false:\n\n1. **Lactose Intolerance**: Most", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Donatello: Italian painter and sculptor.
