South America generally has a coastline along most of its borders, except for Bolivia and Paraguay.\n2. Both Bolivia and Paraguay are landlocked nations located entirely within South America.\n3. Bolivia is completely surrounded by Brazil and Chile, while Paraguay is bordered by Argentina and Brazil.\n4. These two countries lack direct access to the ocean, requiring them to use neighboring countries' ports for trade and maritime activities.\n\nTherefore, there are indeed landlocked countries in South America, with Bolivia and Paraguay being prime examples.
