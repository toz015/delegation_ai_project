The letter D originated from the Phoenician letter dalet, which was derived from a simple triangular symbol resembling a doorframe. This triangular shape represented the left-hand stile of an ancient door. The shape of the Phoenician dalet was inspired by the structure of ancient doors, and this resemblance has persisted through historical changes in typography. Even in modern times, the basic design elements of the letter D often still resemble the structural lines of a door frame. Therefore, the letter D is indeed influenced by the shape of ancient doors.
