Furthermore, the setting and premise of \"Sea Hunt\" involve diving and underwater investigations, which have no relation to the historical context of the Tower of London in the 1400s.

However, in the 1400s, when the Tower was already centuries old, medieval experts rather than modern TV hosts would have been fascinated by it. Since Robert Stack lived and worked decades after the 1400s, he wouldn't have had any direct personal interest in the Tower of London during that specific era for his show.
