Ivan the Terrible ruled Russia from 1547 until his death in 1584. The Byzantine calendar, which was used by the Eastern Orthodox Church from around 691 to 1728, stopped being the official calendar of the church after 1728. Since Ivan the Terrible died in 1584, long before the Byzantine calendar was discontinued, he did not use this calendar during his reign. The answer is: false.

Specifically, the last year of Ivan the Terrible's rule (1584 CE) comes after the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1492, which eventually replaced the Julian calendar.\n\nTherefore, Ivan the Terrible\u2019s rule period cannot be described as being exclusively under the Byzantine calendar.\n\n**Final Answer:** False.

Most of Ivan the Terrible's reign occurred well before the end of the Byzantine calendar's usage. Additionally, Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1492, moving away from the Julian calendar long before Ivan the Terrible became tsar. Thus, Ivan the Terrible did not exclusively use the Byzantine calendar. The answer is: false.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
