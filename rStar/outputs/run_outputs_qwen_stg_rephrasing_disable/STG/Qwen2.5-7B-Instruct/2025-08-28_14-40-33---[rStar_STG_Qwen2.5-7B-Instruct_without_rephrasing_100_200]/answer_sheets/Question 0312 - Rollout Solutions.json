Cream is naturally present in whole milk due to the fat content. During processing, cream can be separated from whole milk through several methods:\n\n1. **Centrifugal Separation**: Whole milk is fed into a centrifuge where the different densities cause separation based on centripetal force. Heavier components like fat rise to the top, allowing cream to be collected separately.\n2. **Settling Tanks**: Unhomogenized milk is left to sit in large tanks. Over time, the fat rises to the surface, forming a layer of cream that can be skimmed off.\n3. **Homogenization Followed by Centrifugation**: Milk undergoes homogenization to break down fat globules, making them smaller and evenly distributed.
