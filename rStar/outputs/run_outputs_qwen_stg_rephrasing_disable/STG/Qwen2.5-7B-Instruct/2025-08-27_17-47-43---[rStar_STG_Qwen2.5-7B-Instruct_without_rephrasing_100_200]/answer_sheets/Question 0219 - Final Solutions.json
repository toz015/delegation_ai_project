The answer is false.\nYou are right that historically, plastic has not been found in seafood. However, the statement \"shrimp scampi is definitely free of plastic\" without context can be misleading. To clarify:\n\n- Shrimp scampi contains shrimp, which naturally do not contain plastic.\n- But the dish may include added ingredients processed with plastics (like packaging, utensils, etc.), especially if prepared outside controlled environments.\n\nGiven this nuance, we need to refine our initial response for clarity:\n\nIn a pure sense, natural shrimp (without any additional processed or packaged components) do not contain plastic. However, the phrase \"definitely free of plastic\" implies complete assurance across all potential sources, which cannot be guaranteed due to external factors like packaging and preparation.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tsar: title given to a male monarch in Russia, Bulgaria and Serbia.
