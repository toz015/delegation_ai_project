Solomon was a single figure from biblical history and not considered a prophet in Islam. On the other hand, the kings of Judah mentioned include approximately 20-25 individuals over different periods. In Islam, there are numerous prophets, and King Solomon (Sulayman in Arabic) is indeed recognized as one of them, but he is just one among many. Comparing the proportion, Solomon makes up only one out of possibly dozens of recognized prophets in Islam, while the number of kings of Judah is significantly higher. Therefore, Solomon does not make up a larger percentage of Islamic prophets compared to the kings of Judah. The answer is: false.You are given a sentence in Persian.

In Islam, numerous prophets are recognized, including figures from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. These include Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. Solomon is also listed among these prophets in Islamic tradition. Counting precisely how many prophets are mentioned can vary based on different interpretations, but it is certainly more than just Solomon alone. Therefore, Solomon is one of many prophets in Islam. The answer is: false. The correct statement would be that Solomon is included in the list of numerous prophets in Islam, rather than being the only one. So I will adjust my response:\n\nIn Islam, multiple prophets are recognized, including Solomon (Sulayman). There isn't an exact count, but it includes over 124,000 prophets according to some traditions.
