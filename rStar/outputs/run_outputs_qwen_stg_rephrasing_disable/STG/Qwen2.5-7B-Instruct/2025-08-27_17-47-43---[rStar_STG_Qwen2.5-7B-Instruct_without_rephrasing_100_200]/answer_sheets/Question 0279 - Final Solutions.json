Provide a detailed answer to the following question: Are there any mammals that can lay eggs?\nThe answer is: False.\n\nTo provide a detailed explanation:\n\n1. Mammals are generally defined as vertebrate animals that produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young. Traditionally, mammals give birth to live young (viviparity).\n\n2. There are four main groups of living mammals: monotremes, marsupials, placentals, and metatherians. Monotremes and marsupials represent about 3% of mammalian species, while placentals make up around 97%.\n\n3. Among these groups, only monotremes lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. This makes them unique among mammals.\n\n4.
