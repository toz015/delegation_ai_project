Pottery can be broadly divided into two categories based on its use and intended purpose: functional ware and decorative ware. Functional pottery, designed for cooking, must meet specific criteria to ensure safety when exposed to high temperatures. These include being food-safe and heat-resistant. Decorative pottery may not be suitable for cooking due to potential lead content in glazes or other factors that make them unsuitable for direct contact with food.\n\nHowever, even within the category of functional pottery, not all types are guaranteed to be safe for cooking. For instance, some pottery may have been improperly fired, contain harmful additives, or lack proper certification.\n\nTo ensure safety, one should look for pottery specifically marked as oven-safe and made from food-grade materials.
