Let me try again:\n\nGenghis Khan: Founder and first Great Khan of the Mongol Empire. Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar? \n\nCan you explain in more detail why this is the case?\nThe answer is: true.\nBecause Genghis Khan had numerous direct male-line descendants, and many of them also had sons who contributed to modern gene pools. This means that through Y-chromosomal inheritance, his bloodline has spread widely across Asia and into Europe. Julius Caesar, while historically important, had fewer direct descendants and a smaller genetic footprint compared to Genghis Khan. Thus, more people today can trace their ancestry back to Genghis Khan through the male line.
