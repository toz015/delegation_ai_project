Soluble fiber, found in foods like oats, peas, beans, apples, and citrus fruits, dissolves in water and forms a gel-like material that can help slow digestion and absorb excess cholesterol and sugars. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat, nuts, and vegetables, aids in moving food through the digestive system quickly, reducing the time waste products remain in the colon.\n\nEating adequate amounts of dietary fiber supports overall digestive health by:\n\n1. Promoting regular bowel movements.\n2. Reducing symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n3. Lowering the risk of hemorrhoids and diverticular disease.\n4. Helping maintain healthy blood sugar levels.\n5. Supporting heart health by lowering cholesterol levels.\n\nWhile fiber is beneficial, consuming too much too quickly can lead to bloating and gas, so it's important to increase fiber intake gradually and ensure proper hydration.\n\nIn summary, fiber intake positively affects digestive health, helping prevent issues like diarrhea and constipation. The answer is: true. The benefits of fiber for digestive health outweigh any potential negative effects when consumed appropriately.

The answer is: true. \n\nFinal Answer: The answer is: true. Eating too many oranges can potentially cause diarrhea, particularly if consumed in large amounts by someone whose body isn't accustomed to such a change in diet.
