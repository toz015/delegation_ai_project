Humans require water for numerous vital bodily functions, including temperature regulation, waste elimination, and maintaining cell structure. Without sufficient hydration, the body will begin to shut down essential processes leading to dehydration and eventually death. The human body can go weeks without food but only days without water, depending on environmental conditions. The answer is: false. \n\nFinal answer: False. The reasoning is based on the critical role water plays in sustaining life through its involvement in essential physiological functions like metabolism, temperature regulation, and nutrient transport. Dehydration severely impairs these processes and leads to fatal outcomes much faster than starvation. The body can endure longer periods without food due to stored energy sources, whereas water is continuously required for survival. Therefore, a person cannot survive without drinking water.
