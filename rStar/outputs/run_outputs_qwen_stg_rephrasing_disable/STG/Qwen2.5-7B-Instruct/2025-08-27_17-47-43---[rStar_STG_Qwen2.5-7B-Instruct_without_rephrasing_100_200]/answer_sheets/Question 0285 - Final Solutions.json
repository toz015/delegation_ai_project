For example, New York City adopted 911 in 1968, but many areas did not adopt it until much later. Given that the availability and usage of 911 varied widely depending on location, it is highly unlikely that Eddie Murphy, as a young child in the late 1960s or early 1970s, would have been able to dial 911.
