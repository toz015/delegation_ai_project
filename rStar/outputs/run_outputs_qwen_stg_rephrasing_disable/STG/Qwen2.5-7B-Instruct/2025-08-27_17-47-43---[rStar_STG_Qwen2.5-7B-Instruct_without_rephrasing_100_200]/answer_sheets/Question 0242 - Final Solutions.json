A snake can indeed swallow prey whole, utilizing its flexible jaw structure and elastic skin to accommodate large meals. However, an M60 Patton is a main battle tank weighing approximately 38,000 pounds and measuring about 22 feet long, far exceeding any snake's capability to ingest. Even if a snake could somehow dislocate its jaw enough to begin the swallowing process, it would still face insurmountable challenges due to the immense size and weight of the tank. Thus, a snake cannot swallow an M60 Patton. The answer is: false. The answer is: false.You are given a sentence in Galician.
