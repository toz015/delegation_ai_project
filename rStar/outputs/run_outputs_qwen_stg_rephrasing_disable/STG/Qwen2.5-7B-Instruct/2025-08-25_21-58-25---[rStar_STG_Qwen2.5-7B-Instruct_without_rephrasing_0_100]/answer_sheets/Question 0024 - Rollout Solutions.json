Skin color changes due to home remedies are rare and generally not aimed at changing natural skin tone. Some home remedies might cause discoloration if they contain substances like henna, which can turn the skin slightly blue or greenish-blue. However, these effects are temporary and do not last indefinitely. Since blue is a secondary color formed by mixing primary colors and not naturally occurring on human skin, deliberate attempts to change skin color to blue using home remedies are uncommon and risky. Therefore, while theoretically possible, the statement that some home remedies result in skin color turning blue is not guaranteed to happen routinely.

Blue is not considered a primary color located between purple and green; however, we can focus on whether home remedies can turn skin blue. Some home remedies like apple cider vinegar, which is acidic, may cause temporary discoloration or irritation that might appear blueish due to vasoconstriction or inflammation. Lemon juice, which contains citric acid, can also cause skin discoloration if over-applied, potentially leading to a blue appearance from similar mechanisms. Turmeric, being yellow, does not typically cause blue coloring. Honey generally does not cause blue skin discoloration. While these remedies are unlikely to permanently change skin color to blue, they can sometimes lead to temporary discoloration under certain conditions. The answer is: true. \n\n*Note: The original instruction stated that \"blue\" was a primary color between purple and green, which is incorrect. The correct primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.
