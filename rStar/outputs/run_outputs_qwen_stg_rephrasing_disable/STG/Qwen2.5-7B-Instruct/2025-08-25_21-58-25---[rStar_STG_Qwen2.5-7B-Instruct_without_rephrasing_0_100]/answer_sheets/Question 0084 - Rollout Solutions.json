Bodybuilders choose one type of meat over another based on factors like protein content, fat content, and overall nutritional value. Elk meat is lean and high in protein, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders who aim to build muscle mass without excessive fat intake. Other types of meat may also be chosen based on these criteria. Therefore, elk can be a preferred choice for bodybuilders due to its favorable nutritional profile.

Elk meat is considered leaner and higher in protein compared to beef. It also contains essential nutrients like iron and zinc that can benefit muscle growth and recovery.
