Eagles are indeed symbols of strength and skill in many cultures, often used to represent leadership, vision, and determination.

On the other hand, young bears (cubs) are not commonly used as symbols for skills-training youth groups. Cub scouts, which might be confused here, use different symbols like the Cub Scout logo featuring Bobcat, Wolf, Bear, and Lion Cubs. Therefore, only eagles are typically used as labels for skills-training youth groups, not young bears. The answer is: false. The hint and additional information provided clarify that young bears are not used as symbols for such groups. The correct statement would be that eagles alone are used as labels for skills-training youth groups, making the original statement incorrect. \n\nThe answer is: false.
