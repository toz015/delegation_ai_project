Running for President of India involves several costs such as campaign expenses, legal fees, and other administrative costs. However, the primary candidates often have substantial financial backing from political parties or personal resources, making the direct cost difficult to quantify precisely. Additionally, the Constitution mandates that candidates must deposit a security amount, which is currently set at Rs 15 lakhs (approximately $20,000 USD). This deposit is returned if the candidate fulfills certain criteria, otherwise it is forfeited. \n\nGiven these considerations, while there are specific monetary requirements like the security deposit, the overall cost can vary significantly depending on the candidate's resources and campaign strategy. A rough estimate would include this deposit and additional expenses, but without specific details on each campaign, it is challenging to provide an exact figure. \n\nTherefore, while we know there is a security deposit requirement, the total cost varies widely.
