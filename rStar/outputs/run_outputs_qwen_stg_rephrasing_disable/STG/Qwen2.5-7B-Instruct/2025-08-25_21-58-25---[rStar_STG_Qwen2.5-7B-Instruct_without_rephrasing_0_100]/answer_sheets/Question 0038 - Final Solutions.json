Cooking involves using heat to prepare food. An electric stove with a glass top requires care when selecting cookware due to the potential for scratching the surface. Cast iron skillets are excellent for cooking because they retain heat well and evenly distribute heat. However, they can scratch glass surfaces if not handled carefully. Given this, while cast iron skillets are good for cooking, they may not be ideal for use on a glass-top stove without careful handling to prevent damage to the cooktop. Therefore, you might want to consider alternative cookware that is less likely to scratch the glass surface.

The glass top must support a maximum temperature that exceeds the heating capabilities of cast iron skillets.
