While using Euros to pay for a coffee in NYC might be uncommon, it is still feasible due to the nature of global travel and tourism in New York City.

The original statement was asking if someone would pay for a coffee in NYC with Euros, implying whether this practice occurs. Given that the US dollar is primarily used in New York City for everyday transactions, paying with Euros directly is uncommon and impractical without exchanging them first.
