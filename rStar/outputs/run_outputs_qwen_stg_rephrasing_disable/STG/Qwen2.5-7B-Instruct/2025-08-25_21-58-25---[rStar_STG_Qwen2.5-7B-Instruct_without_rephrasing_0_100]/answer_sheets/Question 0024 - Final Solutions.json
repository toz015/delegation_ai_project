Skin color is primarily determined by melanin, a pigment produced by melanocytes in the skin. Factors that can cause changes in skin color include sun exposure, which increases melanin production; hormonal changes like those during pregnancy; and certain medical conditions or medications that affect melanin production or distribution. Changes in diet, genetics, and aging can also contribute to variations in skin pigmentation. \n\nHowever, blue is not considered a primary color between purple and green. The primary colors are red, yellow, and blue (RYB), whereas purple is a secondary color formed from mixing red and blue, and green is another secondary color formed from mixing yellow and blue. \n\nTherefore, while the question about blue being a primary color between purple and green is incorrect, we focus on what causes changes in skin color: factors affecting melanin production and distribution, such as sun exposure, hormones, and medical conditions.

Blue is not a primary color between purple and green, so we'll focus on the second part of the question, which asks if some home remedies can result in skin color turning blue.

Specifically:\n\n- **Lemon Juice:** Contains citric acid and vitamin C, which can lighten the skin temporarily by removing top layers and inhibiting melanin production.\n- **Turmeric:** When applied topically, turmeric can stain the skin a shade of yellow-orange and, occasionally, under prolonged exposure, it might give a bluish-green tinge due to its active ingredient curcumin.\n- **Black Tea:** Applied as a poultice, black tea can also lighten the skin and potentially produce a bluish-gray discoloration.\n\nTherefore, while it is uncommon for home remedies to turn skin permanently blue, they can sometimes create temporary blueish discolorations due to the chemical properties of certain ingredients.
