If you block out the sun, even for just your local area, a full circle rainbow can form. That is why you often see rainbows at waterfalls or after rainstorms, when the light gets blocked by trees or buildings. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Let me correct it:\n\nA full circle rainbow forms when the observer is positioned very close to the point directly opposite the sun (the antisolar point), allowing them to see the entire arc of the rainbow from horizon to horizon.

A full circle rainbow appears under specific conditions. Rainbows form when light is refracted, reflected, and then refracted again in water droplets, creating a spectrum of colors. Typically, we see rainbows as arcs because they are observed from ground level. To see a complete circle, an observer must be at the correct position\u2014usually 22 degrees above the horizon, directly opposite the sun\u2014while looking towards a perfectly circular area of sky illuminated by the sun through falling raindrops.
