However, without specific context about the environment, we cannot definitively rule out any scenario.\n\nConsidering these factors, let's aim for a reasonable estimate based on common practices:\n\n- **Common practice:** People generally respond to roll calls by their given names.\n- **Uniqueness of nickname:** Shaggy might use his stage name or nickname in informal settings, but formal environments typically stick to given names.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability is lower than 50% but not zero.\n\n**Final Answer:** The likelihood that Shaggy, the musician, would raise his hand during first-name roll call is likely below average, but not impossible.
