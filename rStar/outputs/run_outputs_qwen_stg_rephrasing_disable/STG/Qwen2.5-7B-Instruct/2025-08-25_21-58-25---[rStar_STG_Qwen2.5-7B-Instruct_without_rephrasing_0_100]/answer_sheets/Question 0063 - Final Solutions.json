Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and is a variable-length holiday depending on when Ramadan falls relative to the lunar calendar.

The Triple Crown in horse racing comprises three races\u2014Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes\u2014which must be won within a few weeks (early May to mid-June) to achieve the title.
