Popeye is a fictional character known for gaining strength from eating spinach. According to the original comic strips and subsequent animated series, Popeye would typically consume a can of spinach. This was often depicted as a large, single serving that provided immediate superhuman strength. Therefore, Popeye usually ate one can of spinach at a time. The answer is: true. \n\nThe answer is: true. Based on the context and details provided about Popeye's consumption habits in the comics and animated series, he typically ate one can of spinach. The correct answer should be \"one can,\" but since the instruction asks specifically if this statement is true or false, we conclude with \"true.\" However, if I need to stick strictly to the format requested, the exact phrasing should be adjusted accordingly.
