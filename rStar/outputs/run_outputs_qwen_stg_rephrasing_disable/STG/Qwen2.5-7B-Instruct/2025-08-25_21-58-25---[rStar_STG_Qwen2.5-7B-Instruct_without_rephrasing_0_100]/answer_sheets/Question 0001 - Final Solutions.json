The tibia is one of the two main bones in the lower leg, alongside the fibula. It plays several important roles in the human body:\n\n1. **Weight-bearing**: The tibia primarily bears the weight of the body during activities like walking, running, and standing.\n2. **Mobility**: It works in conjunction with the femur to facilitate movement at the knee joint.\n3. **Structural Support**: Along with muscles and ligaments, the tibia helps maintain the structure and stability of the lower leg.\n4. **Joint Function**: The tibia forms a socket that interacts with the patella (kneecap), allowing smooth articulation within the knee joint.\n\nThus, the tibia serves crucial structural and functional purposes in the human body.
