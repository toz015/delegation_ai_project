Silk is produced by the Bombyx mori, commonly known as the mulberry silkworm, during its larval stage. These larvae secrete silk from glands located in their heads called the salivary glands. The process involves two main proteins: fibroin and sericin. Fibroin forms the strong core filament, while sericin acts as a protective coating. The larvae spin this silk into cocoons around themselves to protect them during their transformation into moths. The answer is: true. \n\nThe answer is: true.
