Fish food costs $3432054, so that is $3432054.\nSo if we add everything together, we get:\n- $10.00 for the aquarium\n- $5.00 for the rocks\n- $10296162 for the coral\n- $10.00 for the fish\n- $343", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.
