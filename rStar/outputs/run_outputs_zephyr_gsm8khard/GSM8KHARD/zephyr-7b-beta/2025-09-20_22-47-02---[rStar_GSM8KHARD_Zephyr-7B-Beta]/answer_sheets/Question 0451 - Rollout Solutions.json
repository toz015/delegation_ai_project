The total spent by the basketball coach is therefore $112 + X dollars. Using our earlier answers, we get $112 + X = $84729856 - $84729856$. Solving for X, we find that the basketball coach spent $X = $112$ on basketballs and X = $-73498744$ on other expenses, i.e., he lost that much money! But that makes no sense, since the problem says he spent more than the baseball coach, not that he was $73498744$ poorer than the baseball coach. So, let's assume that we made a mistake somewhere, maybe in our calculation of the basketball coach's expenses. However, we do know that the basketball coach spent more than the baseball coach. Let's calculate what that difference might be. Since the baseball coach spent $84729856$ dollars on baseballs, and the basketball coach spent $112$ dollars on basketballs, they both spent $84729744$ dollars on their respective sports gear. However, the baseball coach may have also spent money on other unspecified expenses. On the other hand, we don't know anything about the basketball coach's unknown expenses. So, let's simply say that the basketball coach spent $X$ dollars more than the baseball coach, where $X$ > 0. Then, the total expenses of the basketball coach would be $112 + X$ dollars, and the total expenses of the baseball coach would be $84729856$ dollars. We now have two expressions for the total expenses, one for each coach. Equating these two expressions gives us $112 + X = 84729856$. Solving for X, we obtain $X = 84729856 - 112 = 84728744$ dollars.
