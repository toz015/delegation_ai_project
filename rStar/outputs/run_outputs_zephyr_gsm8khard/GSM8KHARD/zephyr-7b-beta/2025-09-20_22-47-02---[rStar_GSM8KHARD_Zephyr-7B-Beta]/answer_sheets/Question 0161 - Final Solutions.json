Question: Based on this information, how many flowers does Andy ultimately plant?", "ost_step": {"1": "Andy plants a specific number of geraniums (let's call this x)."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Andy plants a specific number of geraniums, which we can call x. He also plants petunias, which is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums he plants. That means he plants 40 less geraniums worth of petunias. Let's call the number of petunias p. 40 fewer geraniums is the same as p petunias. We know that x - p = 40. Next, let's add up the total number of flowers Andy plants. That's the number of geraniums plus the number of petunias. X geraniums and p petunias equals the total number of flowers. Let's call it F. X + p = F. Plugging our expression from the first equation into the second, we get: x + x - 40 = F. Simplifying this gives us: 2x - 40 = F. The answer is: The number of flowers Andy ultimately plants is 2x - 40. However, we don't know what x is yet.

Question: Based on this information, how many flowers does Andy ultimately plant?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We are given two conditions related to two different types of flowers (geraniums and petunias). To find out the exact number of flowers Andy ultimately plants, we need to know the number of geraniums he has planted. Let's call this number 'x'. According to condition 2, when Andy plants petunias, it is 'x' less than the number of geraniums he plants. In other words, the number of petunias he plants can be found as follows: 'x' - 40. Now let's see what Andy eventually plants in total. It is simply the sum of the number of geraniums and the number of petunias he plants. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as follows: x + (x - 40) = number of flowers Andy eventually plants.
