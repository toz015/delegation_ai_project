First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate 2/5 of all the oranges, let's write that as a fraction. (2/5) of 9935353 is equal to (2/5) * 9935353. Simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator separately by the LCD (least common denominator). This time, it's 5, since 5 goes into both the numerator and denominator evenly. The LCD gives us: 2 * 5 / (5 * 5) = 2/10 or 0.2. 0.2 * 9935353 is equal to 1987071 oracles. That means Stetson ate 1987071 oranges.

The amount Stetson had when they first went to the farm was $23 dollars. Then Stetson paid $1760 dollars because of the bet, so he should have $23 - $1760 = -$1737 dollars now! But, we know that money can't be negative. This tells us that Stetson doesn't have enough money to pay off his bet. To fix this, we'll assume that Alec helped out Stetson, so Stetson still owes $1760 dollars to Alec. If we don't count the money that Alec spent to help out Stetson, then we can assume that Alec helped out Stetson by giving him $X dollars. In other words, Alec paid $X dollars for Stetson's part of the bet. We have the following system of equations to describe the situation: 1) Stetson had $23 dollars when they arrived at the farm. 2) Stetson paid $1760 dollars because of the bet about eating oranges. 3) Alec gave Stetson $X dollars to cover his part of the bet. We can create another equation using these information. Let's call the total money Stetson and Alec have right now \"T\". T = 23 - 1760 + X. Substituting our earlier equations into this, we have: 4) T = -1737 + X. From here, we need to find out how big X is. Let's calculate the sum of equation (2) and (3): Stetson paid $1760 dollars because of the bet and Alec gave $X dollars to cover Stetson's part. Thus, the total amount Stetson and Alec paid is $1760 + X dollars. However, we already have the total amount Stetson and Alec have today, which is T dollars.
