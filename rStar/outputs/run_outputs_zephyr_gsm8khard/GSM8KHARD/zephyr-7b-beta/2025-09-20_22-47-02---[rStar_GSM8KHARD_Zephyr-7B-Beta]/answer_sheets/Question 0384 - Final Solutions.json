Since Chris did 446492 problems on Monday night, he did 3 times this number on Tuesday night, which equals 1339476 problems. Adding these together, we find that Chris did a total of 446492 + 1339476 = 1786008 problems by the end of Tuesday night.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of problems Chris had left to complete after Tuesday night using the formula for finding the remainder when dividing by a certain value. Divide the original amount of problems (100) by the number of problems completed on Tuesday night (1786008), then multiply by the remaining problems.
