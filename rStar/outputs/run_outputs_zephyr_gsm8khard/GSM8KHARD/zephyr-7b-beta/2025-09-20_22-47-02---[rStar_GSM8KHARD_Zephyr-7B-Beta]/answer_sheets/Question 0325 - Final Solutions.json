Our horse runs at 32 mph. 32 mph is equivalent to 32 miles per hour. In half an hour (30 minutes), our horse would run 16 miles. Each time the horse goes one mile, it consumes 1/2 a bale of hay, which costs $3. We multiply this by the number of miles traveled and get the cost of hay consumed in terms of distance travelled. So the cost of hay is $0.16 per meter. We convert time into seconds to make calculations easier. 30 minutes is 1800 seconds. In this time, the horse travels 16 miles or 25.6 kilometers. Therefore, the cost of hay consumed is $0.16/meter * 25.6 kilometers or $4.10. Michael starts with $30 ($6 * 5) dollars, less $4.10 for hay is $25.90 dollars remaining.
