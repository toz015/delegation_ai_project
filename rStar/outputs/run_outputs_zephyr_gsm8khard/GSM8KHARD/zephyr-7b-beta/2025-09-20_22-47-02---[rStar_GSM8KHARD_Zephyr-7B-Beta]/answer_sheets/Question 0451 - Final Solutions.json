Finally, we need to find out how much else the basketball coach may have spent. Since we already know what the baseball coach spent, we calculate the difference between the two. The difference is the total amount spent by the basketball coach, minus the amount spent by the baseball coach. Difference = Basketball coach's total amount - Baseball coach's total amount. Plugging in our calculations above, we get: Difference = Basketball coach's total amount - Baseball coach's total amount = Basketball coach's basketball cost + Anything else - Baseball coach's baseball cost. Substituting our calculations from previous answers into this equation, we get: Difference = $896 (Basketball coach's basketball cost) + Anything else - $8,468,912,00 (Baseball coach's baseball cost).

This is equal to $10460791.67 per ball. The basketball coach spent $23 on all the basketballs and baseballs combined. We know how many basketballs and baseballs the basketball coach bought, as we figured out earlier. To find how many baseballs the basketball coach bought, let x be the number of baseballs. Let y be the number of basketballs. We know that x + y = 9 (the total number of balls purchased). Using the information we have about the price of one baseball ($10460791.67) and the price of one basketball ($1.75), we can set up a system of equations:\n\nx * $10460791.67/ball + y * $1.75/ball = $9414724 (the amount the baseball coach spent)\n8 * $1.75/ball + x = $23 (the amount the basketball coach spent)\n\nNow we can solve these equations using algebra.
