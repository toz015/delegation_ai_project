Step 4: To calculate how much more they need to earn to reach their goal, we can use what we learned in steps 1 through 3. Let's say they earn y dollars in total after 3 pm (so their combined earnings will be the sum of the amounts they earned from 9 am to 3 pm plus the additional y dollars earned after 3 pm). Step 5: Let's write this in mathematical terms. Together, they earned 91 dollars from 9 am to 3 pm, and Keegan earned x dollars during that same time period.

So their new goal is the sum of the total amount they earned and the amount they still need to earn to reach their original goal of $4633489 dollars. Using our previous calculation, we can replace the total amount they earned with its formula (91 + x) and replace the remaining amount they need to earn with a variable z.
