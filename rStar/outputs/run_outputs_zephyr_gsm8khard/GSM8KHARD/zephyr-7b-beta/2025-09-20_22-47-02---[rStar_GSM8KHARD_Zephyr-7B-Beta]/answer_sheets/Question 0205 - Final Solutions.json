That's the first part of the puzzle. Since each mamba has twice as many spots as a cobra, that means for each mamba we would expect half as many spots. So if the number of spots on a mamba is 'x', then it takes 2 times as many mambas to get as many spots as there are from the cobras alone. We know that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas, and so the ratio of cobras to mambas is 40 : 60. The ratio of spots from cobras to spots from mambas is therefore also 40 : 60. Therefore, 40 times as many spots come from the cobras, and 60 times as many spots come from the mambas. So we can set up the equation 40C + 60M = Total Spots (TS).
