Where 't' represents the number of days since the seedling was established.\n\nUsing our hint, let's say it currently takes 'n' days for the stem to reach the same height as the window (which is at a height of 20 feet).\n\nSince the stem is currently at a height of 4 feet, we can set up an equation like so:\n\n4 = 4 * 2^n\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n\n1 = 2^n\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\nlog_2(1) = n\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nn = 0\n\nWhich means the stem already reaches the same height as the window, and it only took 2^0 = 1 day!

As Mark's window is located at a height of 20 feet above ground level, we can see that the stem needs to reach a height of 24 feet (i.e., 4 feet initially plus 20 feet of altitude above ground level plus an additional 4 feet gained from growing an extra 4 feet during the next 2 days) before it overtakes Mark's window. The stem will thus attain the necessary height after a further 2 days, making a total of 2 days plus the number of days already passed since the stem was first planted.
