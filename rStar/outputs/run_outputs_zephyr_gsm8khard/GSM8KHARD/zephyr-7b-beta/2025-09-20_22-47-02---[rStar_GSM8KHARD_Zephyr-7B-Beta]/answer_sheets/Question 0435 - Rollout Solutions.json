At the end of the first year, Steve has bought 12 games (1 game for each of the 12 months). 12 is less than the number of games he received for his birthday, so we can say that he still has quite a few leftover games from his birthday present. After the first year, he still has 9481974 - 12 = 9481962 games.\n\nFor the second year, Steve continues saving money, but since he's getting older, he's now able to afford two games per month. That's a total of 24 games over the course of the second year. By the end of year two, Steve will have a grand total of 9481986 games (the 9481962 he still has from the previous year plus the 24 games he bought during the second year).\n\nIn the third year, Steve gets another boost in income thanks to his part-time job.
