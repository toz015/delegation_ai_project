After the first time period (which is two months), the price will be:\n\n$4135596 * (1 + 0.004135596^2) = $4135596 * 1.0082612\n\nAfter another time period, the price will be:\n\n$4135596 * (1 + 0.004135596^2)^2 = $4135596 * 1.01656493\n\nAnd so forth. Using this method, we can calculate the price after any integer number of time periods. After 36 of these time periods, the price will be:\n\n$4135596 * (1 + 0.004135596^2)^{36} = $4135596 *", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If a bag of marbles costs $4135596 and the price increases by 4135596% of the original price every two months, how much would a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much does a bag of marbles cost at the beginning?", "subanswer": {"text": "We set the original price at 1 dollar (to simplify arithmetic).
