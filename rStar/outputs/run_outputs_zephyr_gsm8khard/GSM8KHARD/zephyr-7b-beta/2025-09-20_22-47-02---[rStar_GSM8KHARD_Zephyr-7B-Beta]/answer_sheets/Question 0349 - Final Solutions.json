Each person pays $5000 for the plane ticket. That's a total of $10,000 for both of them. The hotel is normally $1500 per day, but this weekend it is 20% more expensive (a 20% increase is finding a percentage of 100 and adding it to the original number). To find out what that increase is, we need to calculate 20% of 1500 (which is the same as finding 0.2 times 1500). Doing so, we get $300 (0.2 times 1500). So, this weekend, the hotel costs $1500 plus $300, which is $1800 per night. Since they're staying for three nights, we can multiply the cost per night ($1800) by three ($5400) to get the total hotel charge. Adding this to the airfare, we get a grand total of $15,400.
