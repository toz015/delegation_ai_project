First, let's find the number of fourth-grade boys before Friday (using our previous calculation): 2158270. Next, let's find the number of missing fourth-grade boys. The number of missing fourth-grade boys is found by deducting the number of missing students (found above), and the number of girls who were absent (zero). This gives us: numberOfMissingBoysOnFriday = numberOfAbsentees - numberOfMissingGirls - numberOfFourthGradeGirlsAbsent = 9 - 0 - 0 = 9 students. Then, the number of fourth-grade boys on Friday is found by deducting the number of missing fourth-grade boys from the number of fourth-grade boys before Friday. This gives us: numberOfFourthGraderBoysPresentOnFriday = numberOfFourthGraderBoysBeforeFriday - numberOfMissingFourthGraderBoysOnFriday = 2158270 - 9 = 2158261 students.

First, we can find the number of fourth-grade boys using what we know about the total number of fourth graders and the number of girls.
