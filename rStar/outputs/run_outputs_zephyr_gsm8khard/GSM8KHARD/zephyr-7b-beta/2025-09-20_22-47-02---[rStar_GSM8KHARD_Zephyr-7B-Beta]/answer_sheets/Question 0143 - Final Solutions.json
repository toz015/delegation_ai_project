Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Each week, Mark edits x sentences for Publisher A. And he edits 2x sentences for Publisher B because Publisher B pays Mark twice as much. So Mark earns 5 cents for each of the x sentences he edits for Publisher A, and he earns twice as much (i.e., 10 cents) for each of the 2x sentences he edits for Publisher B.\nNow we can find out how much Mark makes each week from Publisher A: It's x times 5 cents, which equals 5x cents. Next, we can calculate how much Mark makes each week from Publisher B: It's 2x times 10 cents, which equals 20x cents.\nAdding up the amounts that Mark earns each week from both Publishers A and B, we get:\n5x + 20x = 1000(total number of sentences Mark edits each week) * (average payment per sentence from both publishers).\nWe know this average payment is calculated by adding the rates paid by both Publishers A and", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mark is a copy-editor.
