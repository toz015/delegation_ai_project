First, let's find the cost of one action figure. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and a certain number of red cars, we can represent this as D = 3A + R (D for doll, A for action figure, R for red car). And the cost of one action figure is represented as C(a) = D/3 - R/5, since it takes three action figures and five red cars to get the same price as the doll and red cars. This is because if you look closely, A represents the number of action figures needed. The higher the value of A, the more action figures you buy, which means you also need fewer red cars.
