Thirdly, out of the remaining students, 3/5 departed from exit B. So, let's calculate the number of students who left via exit A. We know that the percentage who left via exit A is 30%. Let's convert this into a decimal (0.3) and multiply it with the original number of students to get the number of students who left via exit A. The calculation would look like this:\n\n(0.3) x 2780965 = __________\n\nLet's calculate the remaining students after departure via exit A:\n\nOriginal Students \u2013 Students left via exit A = Remaining Students\n\n2780965 \u2013 [Calculated number of students leaving via exit A] = Remaining Students\n\nNow, let\u2019s find the number of students who departed through exit C, which", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

We know that 2780965 students were present in the hall at first. After the meeting, 30% of them left through exit A. So, we can say that the remaining students were 0.7*2780965. Out of these remaining students, 3/5 left through exit B. Let's call this number X. Now, the remaining students through exit C would be the remaining students minus the ones leaving through exit B and exits A. Hence, the remaining students through exit C are equal to ((1-0.7)*2780965-X). Using the second condition mentioned above, we get X=(1-0.3)*((1-0.7)*2780965). Simplifying this expression, we get X=0.21*(1-0.7)*2780965 which is the number of students leaving through exit B.
