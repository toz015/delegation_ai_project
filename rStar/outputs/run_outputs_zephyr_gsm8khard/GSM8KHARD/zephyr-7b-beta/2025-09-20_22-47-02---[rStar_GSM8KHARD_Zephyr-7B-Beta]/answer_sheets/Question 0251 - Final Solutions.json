First, we know that Laurel ended up with 2212505 baby outfits. Here's how we can find out how many baby outfits came from the baby shower and how many came from her mom.

By grouping these terms together, we can see that Laurel received a total of 3x baby outfits from her friends.\n\nWhen we add this quantity to the number of baby outfits her mother gave her (15), we get a total of 3x + 15 baby outfits. This total must also equal the number of baby outfits Laurel ended up with (which we know is 2212505).\n\nSo our expression becomes:\n\n3x + 15 = 2212505\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate the variable.

Notice that I put parentheses around the first term because it's actually an expression that consists of two terms separated by an unknown quantity (x). When we simplify an algebraic expression like this, we want to make sure that we group things inside parentheses in such a way that we keep the operations that bind those terms together. This rule applies to multiplication and division as well as addition and subtraction. It ensures that we distribute operations correctly when we simplify expressions. When you see an expression with an unknown quantity (an 'x') inside parentheses, remember that the expression inside the parentheses is being multiplied by the entire term outside the parentheses.
