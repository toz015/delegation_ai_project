To find out how much it costs to buy 8 pencils, just multiply $5698943 by 8, since each pencil costs that much. That comes out to $455983544. Combining this with the price for buying 6 erasers (which we found earlier) results in a total cost of $12 + $455983544 = $455994752. The answer is: $455994752.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
