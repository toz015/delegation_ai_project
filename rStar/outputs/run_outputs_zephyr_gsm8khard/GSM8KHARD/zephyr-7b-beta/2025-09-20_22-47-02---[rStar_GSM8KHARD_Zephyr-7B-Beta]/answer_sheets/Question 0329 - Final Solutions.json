Condition 3: Bentley fills 170 balloons following this price increase. Question: What amount did Bentley spend on filling his balloons?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many balloons were filled in total?", "subanswer": {"text": "There were 1906951 balloons filled. The answer is 1906951.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that 1906951 balloons were filled initially at a cost of $900. After two days, the price of filling each balloon increased by $1906951. This means that each balloon costs $1906951 more than before. So the new cost per balloon is $1906951 + $1906951 = $3813902. Let's calculate how many balloons Bentley filled. If Bentley filled 170 balloons, then the total number of balloons filled is still 1906951 minus the ones Bentley didn't fill. 1906951 - 170 = 1889981. The cost of filling all these balloons (1889981) would be 1889981 * $3813902 per balloon, which equals $71180160303. Adding the initial cost of $900, we get the total amount spent", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 7}]
