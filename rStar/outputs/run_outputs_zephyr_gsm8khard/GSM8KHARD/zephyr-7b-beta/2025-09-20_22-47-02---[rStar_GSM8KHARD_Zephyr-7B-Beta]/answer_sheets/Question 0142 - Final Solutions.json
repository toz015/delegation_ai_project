But since the first two months already included some gain during those periods, we need to adjust our calculation. Let's call the number of Pokemon cards gained during the first two months y. We know that y is equal to 3x + x2. Now we can calculate the number of cards gained during the third month: it's double the number of cards gained during the first two months minus the number of cards gained during those two months: that's 2(3x+x2)-(3x+x2).

To calculate this, let's call the number of cards she acquired in the first month X and the number of cards she acquired in the second month Y. Then Elaine would have accumulated a total of X + Y during the first two months. And since she accumulated twice as many cards during the third month as she did in the first two months, we can say that she accumulated twice (X + Y) during the third month. So the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine had by the end of the third month was X + Y + 2(X + Y). This simplifies to X + Y + 2Y.
