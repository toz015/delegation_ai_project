First we find out how much money Janeth owes initially because she returned an extra 10%. Initially, she borrowed 2000 dollars. That's 2000 dollars.

Subtract the initial loan (2000) from the total amount repaid (2200) to get the amount still owed (200): 2200 - 2000 = 200.\n\nNow let's calculate how much interest Janeth pays per year. Let r be the annual interest rate as a decimal (for example, 0.05 represents 5% annual interest). 10% of the loan amount is 0.1 times the loan amount, so Janeth's interest is r times the loan amount. But since we want the monthly interest, we need to divide this value by 12.

Janeth pays a certain amount each month, but we don't know how much yet. Let's call this amount x. If she is paying x dollars every month for 12 months, then in total she will have paid 12x.
