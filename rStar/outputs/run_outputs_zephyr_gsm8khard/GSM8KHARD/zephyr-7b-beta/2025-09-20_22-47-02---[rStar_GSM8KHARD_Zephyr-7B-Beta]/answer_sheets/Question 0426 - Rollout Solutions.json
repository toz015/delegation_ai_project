While doing aerobics, Hannah burns 500 calories per hour. This means for every 200 calories she burns, she needs to drink 100 ml of water. 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. So Hannah needs to drink 2.5 x 100 = 250 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. Since Hannah burned 1,000 calories (500 while doing aerobics) we can use this formula to calculate how much water she needs to drink: 1,000 / 200 = 5 liters. Let's say it takes her one liter for the first 200 calories she burns, so she drank 500 ml of water for burning those calories while doing aerobics. That leaves us 4 liters of water needed from burning calories while running. Hannah ran for one hour, and during that time, she burned 600 calories.
