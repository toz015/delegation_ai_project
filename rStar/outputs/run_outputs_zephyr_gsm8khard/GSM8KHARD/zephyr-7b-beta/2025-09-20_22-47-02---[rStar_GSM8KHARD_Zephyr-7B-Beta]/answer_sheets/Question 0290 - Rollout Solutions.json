Since he rode all 9 rides, that's a total of 9*$3078953 = $27690617 per ride for David. But instead of buying individual tickets like Dasha, David opted for the bracelet that cost $30. Using our calculations from earlier, we know Dasha would need about 0.001 tickets per ride. So Dasha would need about 0.001*9 = 0.009 tickets to cover all 9 rides. At $3078953 per ticket, that would be $0.02932799665 tickets worth of rides for Dasha.
