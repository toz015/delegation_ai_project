To find out how many extra minutes it takes Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is hot versus cold, we need to compare the times for both conditions. When the water is cold, Ray can swim a mile in 16 minutes. Since we don't know how many miles it would take him to swim 3 miles in cold water, let's assume it's m miles. Using the condition that when the water is cold Ray can swim a mile in 16 minutes, we can create a formula for the time it takes Ray to swim m miles: m*16 = 3*m miles per hour, since he swims 3 miles. Solving for m yields m = 3/2 miles. Therefore, when the water is cold, it takes Ray (3/2)*16 = 24 minutes to swim 3 miles.
