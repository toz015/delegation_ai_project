Now we just need to subtract that savings from the original price to get Kelly's total cost. 4032768 - 40327.68 = 3629500.42 dollars. So Kelly paid more than Becky by the difference between their costs: 3629500.42 dollars (Kelly) minus 3628700 dollars (Becky) equals 800.42 dollars.

So Becky's total cost is (8065424 apples) * ($0.45 / apple - $1 discount) = ($3630784 / apple) * ($0.45 / apple - $1 / apple) = ($3630784 * (-$0.55)) / apple = $-2.96 per apple. Since she buys 8065424 apples, her total payment is $(-2.96 / apple) * (8065424 apples) = $2,345,678,901,234.54 dollars.

So Kelly's total cost for the apples is (8065424 apples) * ($0.50 / apple) = $4,032,746,500 dollars. But she also gets a 10% discount, which is 0.9 times her original price. So her total discounted cost is $4,032,746,500 * (0.9) = $3,629,567,450 dollars.

According to condition 2, Kelly also buys 8065424 apples, but pays 50 cents per apple instead of 45 cents like Becky. Since we're dealing with whole numbers here, it seems like the price went up by just 5 cents per apple. But let's double check. The regular price of each apple is 50 cents. With a 10% discount, the discounted price is 50 * (1 - 0.10) = 45 cents per apple. This discounted price is equal to Becky's original price, so Becky gets the same discount as Kelly, which means they both buy their apples at the discounted price. So we don't need to recompute the price per apple for Kelly, because it's already accounted for in the discounted price.
