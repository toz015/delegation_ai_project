So let x be the total number of lines in the scene. Then twice that number is also x. But x times a third of it is Sean's lines in the first scene. Let's call that Sean'sLines_scene1. So we have x = 2*x/3, or equivalently, x = 3*Sean'sLines_scene1. We want Sean'sLines_scene1, so let's solve for it: Sean'sLines_scene1 = (3*x)/(2*3) = x/2. This is the number of lines Sean has to memorize for the first scene. But this expression is too complicated to use directly, so let's simplify it: Sean'sLines_scene1 = (3*x)/(2*3) = (3*x)/6.

Let y be the total number of lines in the second scene, and z be the number of lines in the song. Then y = z + 6, and four-fifths of y are Sean's lines. Let's call that Sean'sLines_scene2. So we have y = (4/5)*y. Solving for y we get: y = 5*(4/5)*z.
