Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. Transfer fees are calculated as 3% of the selling price. That is, transfer fees = selling price * 0.03 = 400000 * 0.03 = 12000 dollars. Brokerage fee = selling price * 0.05 = 400000 * 0.05 = 20000 dollars. So the total fees are the sum of the transfer fee and the brokerage fee which is 12000 + 20000 = 32000 dollars. Now we know that Mr. Tan paid off the remainder of his loan, which was $250000. We can calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds by subtracting all expenses from the selling price: Net proceeds = selling price - transfer fee - brokerage fee - remaining loan amount.

Mr. Tan also needs to pay off any loans he still owes on the house. That is $250 000. To get the net proceeds, we add up all the costs (transfer fees, brokerage fees, loan repayment) and subtract it from the selling price. Let's calculate those costs. $12 000 for transfer fees. $20 000 for brokerage fees. And $250 000 for the remaining loan amount. Adding them all together, that is $402 000 in total costs.
