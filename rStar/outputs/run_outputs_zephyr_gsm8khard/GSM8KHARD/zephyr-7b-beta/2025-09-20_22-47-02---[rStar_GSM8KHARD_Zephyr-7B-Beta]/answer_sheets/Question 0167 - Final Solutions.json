The puzzle has 706828 pieces. Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add 2 pieces per minute. First we find out how many pieces Kalinda can add in one hour: 4 pieces per minute times 60 minutes is 240 pieces per hour for Kalinda. Her mother can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, so 2 pieces per minute. So in one hour, her mother can add 2*60 = 120 pieces. Together they add 240 (from Kalinda) and 120 (from Mom), or 360 pieces per hour. To find how many hours it takes to finish the puzzle, divide the number of pieces by the number of pieces per hour: 706828 divided by 360 is approximately 195.95 hours. However, we cannot have decimals of hours, so they will need to work about 196 hours.
