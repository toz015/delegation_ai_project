First we find out how much Scarlett spent on the rocks. She bought 2 bags, each at $2.50. That's $2.50 * 2 = $5.00. Then she bought three corals at prices so big we don't even want to type them here (hint: they are very expensive). Their total price was $3432054. Scarlett also bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, which adds up to $10.00. And finally, she bought fish food at a price so big again that we won't write it down. Altogether, the expense is $5 + $3432054 + $10 + (very large number) = (another very large number). We can't calculate this exact total because the price for coral and fish food was not given. But we can see that scarlett spent a huge amount of money!
