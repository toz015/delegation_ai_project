So we can find the total amount spent on etching like this: (Total # of frames)(Cost per frame)(Percentage of extra cost) = Total cost for logos etched. Let's plug what we know into this formula to solve for the total cost of the logos: 6139339 * $20 * 0.20 = 24557358 dollars. The answer is 24557358.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, let's add up all the costs we know. We already found the total cost for the picture frames and the logos etched onto them, which was $122786780 and $24557358 respectively. Then, we still have 2 seniors receiving pins for $5 each, and 1/4 of the seniors being officers who will receive cords for $12 each. To find out how many officers there are, let's assume there are x officers. Then there will be x officers and (6139339 - x)/4 officers in each category. So we have: Number of officers receiving cords = x officers = x. Number of other officers not getting cords = (6139339 - x)/4 officers. These other officers will not receive pins either, since we know that only 2 officers will be receiving pins. Number of officers not getting pins or cords = (6139339 - x)/4 - 2 officers = (6139339 - x)/2 officers. So the total", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
