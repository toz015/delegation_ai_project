Let's call the time it takes Rob to shingle a house x. Since Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, we can say Royce takes 2 * x + 40 minutes. We also know that Royce takes 40 more minutes than double Rob, so we can say Royce takes 2x + 40 minutes too. By setting up an equation for both times, we get:\n2x + 40 = 2(x + 40)\nExpanding (x+40) to see what's inside the parentheses gives us:\n2x + 40 = 2x + 80\nSubtracting 2x from both sides:\n40 = 80\nDividing both sides by 40:\n1 = 2\nThis isn't possible, because you cannot divide by zero.
