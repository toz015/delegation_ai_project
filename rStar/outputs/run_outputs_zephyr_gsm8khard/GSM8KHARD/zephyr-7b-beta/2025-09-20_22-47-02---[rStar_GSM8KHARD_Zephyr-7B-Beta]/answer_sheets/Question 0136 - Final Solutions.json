First we calculate how many pounds of insects are required per week for all those ducks. This is the product of the amount needed per duck (3.5 pounds) and the number of ducks (7626869). We get: 3.5 pounds/duck * 7626869 ducks = 26738234.5 pounds/week. Next, we divide the number of pounds required for one week (26738234.5 pounds/week) by the number of pounds required per pound (3.5 pounds/pound). We get: 26738234.5 / 3.5 = 7626869.2 weeks.
