The bakery made 200 loaves on Monday morning. They sold 4542925 in the morning, so they had 200 - 4542925 = -4522925 loaves left at the end of the morning sale (since selling more than you produce is impossible). However, we know that they sold another 39 loaves in the afternoon. So in total, they sold 4542925 + 39 = 4543264 loaves. Subtracting the loaves they produced on Monday morning and the ones returned, we get: 4543264 - 200 - 6 = -2521448 loaves. Since the number is negative, it doesn't make sense as it represents a loss of loaves which is impossible.

To do this, let x represent the number of loaves that were sold Tuesday through Saturday mornings. We then know that the Beverly Hills Bakery sold a total of: 4542925 + 39 + x = 4543264 loaves. Using the distributive property, we get: 4542925 + 39 + x = 4543264. Simplifying and subtracting 4542925 from both sides: x = 4543264 - 4542925 - 39 = 34 loaves. This means that they needed to sell about 34 loaves every day Tuesday through Saturday mornings, just to use up all the loaves they made on Monday.
