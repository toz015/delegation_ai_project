First, let's find out how much Theo spends on suits and suitcases. Six suits for $100 each add up to $600. Three suitcases for $50 each add up to $150. That's a total of $750. Then we know the price of one flight ticket is five times as much as a suit. One suit costs $100, so a flight ticket costs 5 * 100 = $500 more than the price of a suit. So the total spent on suits, suitcases, and flights is $750 + $300 = $1050. Let's subtract what Theo has already spent: $1050 - $600 - $150 = $250. Now we know how much Theo has left over for other expenses. That includes saving $2000 and buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa. Let's call the amount for gifts and savings \"x\".

Theo has $3721399. He spends 6 * 100 = $600 on the suits, 3 * 50 = $150 on the suitcases, and $700 + (5 * 100) = $1700 on the flight ticket. That adds up to $2850 for these purchases. Subtracting that amount from his original $3721399 leaves him with $3436399. From this amount, he saves $2000, leaving him with $3416399. The answer is: The remaining amount is not explicitly asked for, but we can calculate it by finding out how much money he has left after making all his expenses and saving for the trip. Let's first find out how much he spends on gifts for his business partners: let x be the amount of money spent on gifts. We know that the total expenses are equal to the remaining money plus the gift expenses: 3416399 = 3416399 - x. Solving for x, we get", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
