Every hour, Prince sells 15 kilograms of meat. If he works 10 hours, then he sells 15 * 10 = 150 kilograms per day. This is not including any extra meat he gets from Bill's bull. Let's find out how much meat the bull gives him. One kilogram is about 2.2 pounds. 750 kilograms is about 1650 pounds. Since there are 24 hours in a day, let's see how many pounds of meat Prince can get from the bull in one day: (pounds per hour) / (hours per day) = pounds per day. We know that Prince sells 150 kilograms of meat per day from working, so we need to adjust for the extra meat from the bull. (Pounds per hour from working) / (Hours per day working + Hours per day from bull) = Pounds per day.

If Prince sells 15 kg an hour and works for 10 hours, then he sells 150 kg of meat in a day. However, we haven't been told how many kilograms of meat came from Bill's bull. Once we have that information, we can calculate how many kilograms are left to sell using the same formula as before: pounds per day = (pounds per hour) / (hours per day working + Hours per day from bull). Here's an example calculation if Prince sells all the meat from Bill's bull within the first day: pounds per day from bull = (750 * 2.2) / 24 = 312.5 pounds per day. Since Prince sells 150 pounds of meat from working plus another 312.5 pounds per day from the bull, he sells a total of 150 + 312.5 = 462.5 pounds per day. Now we can calculate the number of kilograms that come from the bull in a day: (kilograms per hour) / (hours per day working + Hours per day from bull) = Kilograms per day. Again, we substitute into our formula above: (kilograms per hour from working) / ((10) + (24 / (750 / 2))) = Kilograms per day. Here's an example calculation based on the previous calculation: kilograms per day from bull = (750) / ((2.2) / (312.5 / 2)) = 462.5 kilograms per day. Since Prince sells 150 kilograms of meat from working plus another 462.5 kilograms per day from the bull, he sells a total of 150 + 462.5 = 612.5 kilograms per day. Finally, we can calculate the number of days it takes Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, using a similar formula as before: days to sell meat = (total meat to sell) / (kilograms per day to sell).
