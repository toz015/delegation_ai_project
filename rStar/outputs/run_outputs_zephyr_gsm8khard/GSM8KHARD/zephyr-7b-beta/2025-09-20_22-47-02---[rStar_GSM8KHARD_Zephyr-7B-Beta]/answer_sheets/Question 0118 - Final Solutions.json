Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice Ethel's money, we know that Ethel has $(twice Ethel's money) - 2 = Jimmy's money / 2 - 2. Solving this equation for Ethel's money gives us Ethel's money = (Jimmy's money + 4) / 3. So let's substitute that value into the expression for Ethel's money when Jimmy has $x: x = (x + 4) / 3 - 2. This gives us x = -12, but since we can't have negative amounts of money, there's no solution to this system. In other words, Ethel cannot have less money than Jimmy. Therefore, let's assume that Ethel has the maximum possible value allowed by the constraint that Jimmy has $2 more than twice her money. That is, Ethel has the smallest nonnegative integer value that satisfies the condition that Jimmy has $2 more than twice her money. In fact, this value is $0.
