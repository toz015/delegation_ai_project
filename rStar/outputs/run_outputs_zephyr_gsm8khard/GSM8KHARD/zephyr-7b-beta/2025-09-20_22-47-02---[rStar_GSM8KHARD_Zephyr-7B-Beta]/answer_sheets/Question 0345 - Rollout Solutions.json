First, let's see how many pencils were used in the first two months. Since 1/5 of the pencils were used, let's call the total pencils used \"x\". So, 1/5 of all the pencils was \"x\", which means that the remaining pencils after the first two months is: (total pencils) - ((total pencils) * (1/5)) = (total pencils) * (4/5). We don't yet have a value for \"total pencils\". But we can calculate this. At the start of the year, there were 5915126 students, each with 10 pencils, so the total number of pencils was: 5915126 * 10 = 59151260. Let's call that \"a\". Using our formula above, the remaining pencils after the first two months is: (a) * (4/5), which equals b. Let's call that \"b\".
