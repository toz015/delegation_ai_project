Since Jeff works for 5 days every week (condition 3), we can calculate how many miles Jeff walks every week by multiplying 6 miles per day by 5 days per week, which is 30 miles per week. Finally, we divide the weekly miles (30) by 7 (number of days in a week) to get Jeff's daily average, which comes out to approximately 4.3 miles per day due to commuting.
