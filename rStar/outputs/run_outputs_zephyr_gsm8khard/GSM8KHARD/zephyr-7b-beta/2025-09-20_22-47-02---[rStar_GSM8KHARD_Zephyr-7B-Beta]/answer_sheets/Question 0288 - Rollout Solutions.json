To find out how much a pencil costs, we can use a little trick called \"common difference.\" An eraser costs $2, which is the first term (a). The second term (b) is a pencil, which costs $5698943. To get from the first term to the second term, we need to multiply by a certain factor or \"common ratio\" (r). Since the second term is so much larger than the first term, it seems like the common ratio might be quite large as well, perhaps something like 10^6 or 10^7, but that would mean we would have to compute terms up to hundreds of digits long! Instead, we can observe that the difference between the first and second term (d) is 5698941 dollars.
