We know the second bag has 12 more than the first. Let's call the number of M&Ms in the first bag x. Then the second bag would have x + 12 M&Ms. Next let's find out how many M&Ms are in the third bag. Since it has half as many as the first bag (which had x M&Ms), then the third bag has half that number, or x/2 M&Ms. Summarizing all this, we can create an equation:\n\nx + (x+12) + (x/2) = Total M&Ms\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n3x / 2 = Total M&Ms\n\nNow we can divide both sides by 3/2 to solve for x:\n\nx = Total M&Ms * (2/3)\n\nSo, if we substitute the value for x into the first equation:\n\n(Total M&Ms * (2/3)) + (Total M&Ms * (2/3) + 12)", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 7930843 M&Ms in it.

This is equivalent to saying that the difference between the number of M&Ms in the second and the first bag is 12. Using variables m for the number of M&Ms in the first bag and n for the number of M&Ms in the second bag, we can write this as n = m + 12. Substituting the value of m from the previous question, we can also write this as n = 7930843 + 12. Solving this equation for n, we find that the number of M&Ms in the second bag is n = 7930855.

Mary bought three bags of M&Ms. The first bag had 7930843 M&Ms. Let's call this amount of M&Ms x.
