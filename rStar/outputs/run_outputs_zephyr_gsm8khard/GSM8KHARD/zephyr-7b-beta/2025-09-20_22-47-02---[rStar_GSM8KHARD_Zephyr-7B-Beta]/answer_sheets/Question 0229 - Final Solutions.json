We also know that he wants to save $2000 for this trip, which leaves us with $3721399 - $2850 - $2000 = $7179 remaining. To find out how much Theo has to spend on gifts, we need to figure out what proportion of the remaining budget goes to gifts. Since we don't know this proportion, let's call it x. Then we can set up an equation to find x: $x$ = ($7179 - other gift expenses)/($7179 - other expenses - gift expenses), where \"other gift expenses\" represents any other expenses related to gifts, besides the actual cost of the gifts. Solving for x gives us: $x$ = ($7179 - other gift expenses)/($7179 - other expenses - gift expenses$) = $7179 - other gift expenses)/($7179 - $2850 - gift expenses$). Simplifying this expression, we get: $x$ = $4329 - other gift expenses)/($4329 - other expenses). Plugging this into our equation above, we have: $gift expenses$ = $x$ * ($7179 - other expenses) = ($4329 - other gift expenses)/($4329 - other expenses) * ($7179 - other expenses).

This is the formula we will use to determine how much Theo should spend on gifts based on the remaining budget.

Also, since the cost of his flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit, we know that the cost of one business suit is $140 ($700 divided by 5).
