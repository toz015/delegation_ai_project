Let's say Betty's share is x, and Sam's share is (9381115 - x) since they have all the popsicles together. To find out the number of popsicles Betty has, we need to convert decimal fraction x into a fraction. Firstly, let's calculate the denominator, which is the total number of popsicles, 11. Next, multiply x by 11 to get the numerator, which is the number of popsicles Betty has. The result would look like this: Betty has x/11 popsicles.\n\nNow, we'll repeat this process but for Sam. His share is 6 out of every 11, so his numerator is 6 times the denominator, which is 11. Subtracting the number of popsicles Betty has from this value gets us Sam's number of popsicles.
