To find out how much more Lewis paid than Monica, we subtract the amount Monica paid from the amount Lewis paid. This gives us $30255142 - $92812470 = $-62556328$.

Monica's street is 150 meters long, so it will cost $6187498 * 150 = $928124700 to repave. The answer is 928124700.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How much would it cost to repave Lewis' street?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know how much 1 meter costs, and we know that Lewis' street is longer than Monica's. Let's call the length of Lewis' street L. Since Lewis' street is longer than Monica's street, which is 150 meters long, L > 150. To find out how much it costs to pave Lewis' street, we need to find out how much it would cost per meter and multiply that by the length of the street. Since we know how much one meter costs (Condition 1), all we have to do is multiply L by $6187498. 1 meter costs $6187498. Let's call the length of Lewis' street L. We know that L > 150. Using this information, we can write a system of equations to represent our problem:\n\n1. $6187498 = x \\text{ (cost per meter)} \\times 1$\n2. $6187498 = y \\text{ (cost per meter)} \\times 150$\n3. $y > x$", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: By how much does it cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street?", "subanswer": {"text": "Subtracting the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street gives us:", "value": 0.375}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
