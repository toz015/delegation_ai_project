That includes both vacations and non-working days like weekends. Therefore, we conclude that the builder works for 288 + 234 = 522 days out of 730 in a year.

During a year, the builder earns 12 times this monthly wage, which comes out to $16800. But remember, we also need to subtract the vacation wages.
