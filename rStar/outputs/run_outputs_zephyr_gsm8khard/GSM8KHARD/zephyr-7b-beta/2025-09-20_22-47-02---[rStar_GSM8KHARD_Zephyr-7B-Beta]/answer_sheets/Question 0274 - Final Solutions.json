Condition 1: 9239702 pairs of tennis shoes are sold on Friday during the store's weekend sale. Condition 2: On Saturday, twice as many shoes are sold compared to Friday's sale. Condition 3: On Sunday, half the number of shoes sold on Saturday are sold, and six customers return their shoes due to poor fitting. Question: What is the final total number of tennis shoes sold during the entire weekend sale?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Saturday?", "subanswer": {"text": "If twice as many shoes are sold on Saturday compared to Friday, then the number of shoes sold on Saturday is twice the number sold on Friday. That is, (number sold on Friday) * 2 = (number sold on Saturday). Rearranging yields: (number sold on Saturday) = (number sold on Friday) * 2. Since 9239702 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Friday, then (number sold on Saturday) = 9239702 * 2 = 18479404 pairs of tennis shoes. The answer is 18479404.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "The final total number of tennis shoes sold during the entire weekend sale is the sum of the number sold on Friday, the number sold on Saturday, and the number sold on Sunday minus the number of pairs returned due to poor fitting. This can be written mathematically as follows: Final Total Number Sold = Number Sold on Friday + Number Sold on Saturday + Number Sold on Sunday - Number Returned Due to Poor Fitting. Using our previous calculations, this becomes: Final Total Number Sold = 9239702 + 18479404 + (Number Sold on Sunday) - 6. To find the number sold on Sunday, we use the information that on Sunday, half the number of shoes sold on Saturday are sold. Let x be the number of pairs sold on Sunday. Then, x = (Number Sold on Saturday) / 2. Substituting into our final total number sold equation, we get: Final Total Number Sold = 9239702 + 18479404 + (Number Sold on Saturday) / 2 - 6. Putting it all together, we have: Final Total Number Sold = 9239702 +", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
