In the first month, she collected 3 times as many cards as she did initially. So in the first month, she collected 3 * 8037029 = 24111087 Pokemon cards. In the second month, she collected fewer cards than she did in the first month. Let's call the number she collected y. This means that we can say that y is less than or equal to -6027771.75, since -y represents the number of cards she didn't collect in the second month (i.e., she couldn't collect negative numbers). In the third month, she collected twice as many cards as she did in the first two months combined. Using our values from the previous steps, we know that she collected 2x + 2y Pokemon cards in the third month. Plugging in our known values for x and y, we get:\n\nShe collected 2 * (24111087 - y) + 2y Pokemon cards in the third month.

Let x be the number of pokemon cards elaine had after one month. Then condition 2 is represented as follows: x = 3 * 8037029 = 2411108 cards.\n\nAfter the second month, elaine would have x - 8037029 cards because she gained fewer cards.
