Each adult eats x/4 chocolate bars, since there are four adults sharing them. So each adult eats 4 * x/4 = x chocolate bars in total.

Each child shares equally in the remaining chocolate bars, which is the difference between the total number of chocolate bars and the number eaten by the adults. This can be found as follows: 40 - 4x = n, where n is the number of chocolate bars remaining to be shared among the children.\n\nTo find how many chocolate bars each child gets, divide the remaining number of chocolate bars by the total number of children: n / 8.
