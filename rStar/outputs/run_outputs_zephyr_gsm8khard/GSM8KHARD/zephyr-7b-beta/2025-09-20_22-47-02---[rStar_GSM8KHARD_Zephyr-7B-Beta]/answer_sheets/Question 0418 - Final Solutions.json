First, we calculate the total square footage of Michael's bedroom: 18 * 7655549 = 13890112643. Next, we apply the different costs for carpet, padding, removal, and installation based on the given conditions. We calculate this as follows:\n\nTotal cost = (Carpet cost per sq ft) * (Total square feet) + (Padding cost per sq ft) * (Total square feet) + (Removal cost per sq ft) * (Old square feet) + (Installation cost per sq ft) * (New square feet)\n\nTotal cost = ($7655549 / sq ft) * 13890112643 + ($2 / sq ft) * 13890112643 + ($4 / sq ft) * Old square feet + ($34 / sq ft) * New square feet\n\nTo calculate the total cost, we need to find the total square footage of the old carpet.
