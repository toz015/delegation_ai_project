The cost to acquire these cars was $247,500,00,000. Since the company paid 30% of the price, the remaining amount is 70%. So the cost price was 70% of the retail price (which is $25,000). The sales revenue would be $25,000 per car. The profit would be the difference between revenue and cost. Revenue = Sales Price ($25,000) - Cost Price (70% of $25,000). Profit = Sales Price ($25,000) - Cost Price (70%) - Commission. To calculate James' commission, we use the formula: James' Commission = (Profit * Commission Percentage) / 100. Let's say his commission percentage is x. Commission Percentage (x) = James' Commission / Profit. Commission = Commission Percentage * Profit.

His expenses for all the used cars bought were $17,500 * 9929616 = $179,712,192,000. That left him with a profit of $244,576,192,000 - $179,712,192,000 = $64,864,000 in profit. Adding up the total commissions, calculated earlier, yields the total profit plus commissions, i.e., James' total earnings: $64,864,000 + $64,863,836,240 = $129,727,836,240.
