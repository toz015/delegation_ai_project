Let's calculate the total price of those lollipops: 205 * 25 cents = $5.125. Let's also calculate her daily allowance: 5 dollars. We know that the difference between these two amounts should be the amount of change that Marisa saves in her piggy bank. Therefore", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How much change does Marisa get back from her daily purchases?", "subanswer": {"text": "After calculating how much Marisa spends on lollipops, we can calculate how much change she gets back from her daily purchases. The price of 205 lollipops is $5.125. Her daily allowance is $5. The difference between these two is $0.005, which is negligible, because it is only five one hundredths of a cent. That means Marisa always has no change when she buys lollipops. In other words, she doesn't get any change back from her daily purchases. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the steps involved in finding the change that Marisa saves in her piggy bank after buying lollipops each day?", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much money does Marisa save in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days?", "subanswer": {"text": "Marisa never gets any change back from her daily purchases, as discussed in the previous answer. Hence, she saves all her daily allowance in her piggy bank, which equals zero change. Thus, Marisa saves her entire $5 daily allowance in her piggy bank over a period of 5 days, which is $5 per day times 5 days, which equals $25. The answer is $25.", "value": 0.4375}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 10}]
