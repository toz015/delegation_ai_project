We want to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has (j), but we also want to find out how many toys are missing from the large sorted play set to make up the difference between j and g (g). To find these values separately, we need to split our equation apart and isolate either j or g. Let's look at finding out how many toys are missing from the large sorted play set first.
