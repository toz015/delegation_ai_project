Now let's check if the costs including the venue charges are also identical. We already know that the flat fee for the first venue applies to x guests: $200. Furthermore, we can calculate the charge per guest for the second venue: $28010598 divided by x gives $28010598 / x. Thus, the total charge for the second venue equals x times the charge per guest plus the flat fee: $28010598 / x * x + $200. This reduces to $28010598, which is the same as Mark's cost estimate for the first venue when including both the venue charges and the expenses for food.

Condition 3:  For the first venue, Mark anticipates spending $8010598 on food for each guest.

From condition 3, we know that Mark expects to spend $8010598 on food for each guest in the first venue. In contrast, the second venue charges a fixed price per guest, which includes food, but we don't yet know how many guests are needed to pay the same amount of money as Mark's food bill. Let x represent the number of guests. The cost of food for x guests at the second venue is then x times the charge per guest: x times $28010598 = $8010598. This is equivalent to x = $8010598 / $28010598, rounded to the nearest integer. So the number of guests should be 284 (rounded).
