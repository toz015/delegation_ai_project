We can represent this relationship as Daisy's amount equals Samantha's amount plus 50. Let's write this down as a math expression. We'll call Samantha's amount S, and we'll use variable X to stand in for Carmen's amount. Then our expression looks like this: X + 25 = S; and the expression for Daisy's amount would be S + 50. Let's figure out what's inside the parentheses. S can be written in terms of X and vice versa: S = X + 25 and X = S - 25.

To simplify this expression, let's find a way to write it using fewer variables. One possible strategy is to eliminate one of the variables. Since we know that Samantha's amount equals Carmen's amount plus 25, we can replace all instances of S inside the parentheses with an expression involving X. This lets us get rid of the need for both X and S variables. Let's see what happens when we replace S in terms of X: X + S + S + 50 = X + 2X + 50. Combining like terms, we get 3X + 50. This tells us that all three girls together have 3 times as much as Carmen, plus 50 dollars.
