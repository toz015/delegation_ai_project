Let 'x' be the number of non-gender children in the class. By condition 2, the number of non-gender children is one-tenth the number of boys. So, we can write it mathematically as follows:\nx = (1/10)*y\n\nNow let's find the total number of children, which includes all genders and non-gendered individuals. Total number of children = Number of Boys + Number of Girls + Number of Non-Gender Children\n\nSubstituting the values found previously, we get:\nTotal number of children = y + 3*y + (1/10)*y\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\nTotal number of children = (11/10)*y\n\nWe know the value of 'y', which is 8768586.
