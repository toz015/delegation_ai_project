The food truck sells 10 grilled cheeses for $305.21 each, which totals $3,052.10 in revenue.

To find the cost of cheese and condiments, we know that $30.00 is spent on these items per 10 sandwiches. So the total cost is the sum of the bread cost ($30) and the cheese/condiments cost ($30.00), or $60.00 for all 10 sandwiches. Adding this to our original expenses ($30.00 for bread and $30.00 for cheese/condiments), we get a total expense of $90.00 for all 10 sandwiches.

The bread costs $3 per loaf, and since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, the bread cost per sandwich is $0.30 (= 3 / 10).
