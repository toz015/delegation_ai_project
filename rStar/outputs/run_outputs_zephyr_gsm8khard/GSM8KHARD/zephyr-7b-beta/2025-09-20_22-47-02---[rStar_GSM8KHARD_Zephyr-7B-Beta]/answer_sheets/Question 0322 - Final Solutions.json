Let's first calculate the number of red beads that Margareth has. She has 3 bundles of red beads, so that's 3 * 7234498 = 21703494 pieces of red beads. Next, let's calculate the number of red beads that Elizabeth has. She has 1 bundle of red beads, which equals 7234498 pieces of red beads, as we found out earlier. To summarize, Margareth has 21703494 pieces of red beads, and Elizabeth has 7234498 pieces of red beads. We can see that Margareth has more red beads than Elizabeth, because her number is bigger. Therefore, Margareth exceeds Elizabeth in terms of red bead count by an amount equal to the difference between their red bead counts.
