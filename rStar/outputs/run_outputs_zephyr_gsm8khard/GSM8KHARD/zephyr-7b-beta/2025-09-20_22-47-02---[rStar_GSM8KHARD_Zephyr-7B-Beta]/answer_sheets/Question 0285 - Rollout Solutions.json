Let's write out these relationships as equations.\n- 3/5 of original size = x\n- Remaining part = 2/5 of original size\n- Remaining part = 12.8 hectares\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations. To start, let's use the first equation to substitute the value of the remaining part into our second equation.\n- Remaining part = 2/5 of original size\n- Substituting the value from our first equation, we get: Remaining part = 2/5 * (original size - x)\n\nBut this second equation says that this remaining part is also equal to 12.8 hectares.
