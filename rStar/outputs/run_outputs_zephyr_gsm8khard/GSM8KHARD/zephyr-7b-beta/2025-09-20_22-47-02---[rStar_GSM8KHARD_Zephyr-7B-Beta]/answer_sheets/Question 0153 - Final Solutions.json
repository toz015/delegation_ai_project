Since we know both lengths of the rectangle (the width is 6 miles, and the length is 1.5 miles), we can find out how long it would take to walk completely around the rectangle (which is called its perimeter). This is found by adding up all four sides. The first side is the width (6 miles). The second side is the other width (also 6 miles). The third and fourth sides are both the length (1.5 miles each). So the perimeter is 6 + 6 + 1.5 + 1.5 miles. That's a total of 13 miles! Gary walks around the entire park, so we know the distance he travels is equal to the perimeter. We know that Gary likes to walk around the edge of the park, but we don't know whether he always starts at the same point. It could be possible that he always starts at a corner, or maybe he always starts at a side. Let's assume for the moment that he always starts at one corner (so he goes along the longest side first).

We can't have a decimal answer here, because that would mean fractions of hours. Let's say gary walks for 3 hours and 15 minutes (or 3.25 hours rounded to the nearest quarter hour). The answer is: 3 hours and 15 minutes, or 3.25 hours. Hint 2: What if Gary always starts at the middle of one side, instead of starting at a corner? Would that make any difference in how far he walks or how long it takes him to walk around the rectangle? Let's think step by step. Suppose we start at the midpoint of the bottom side.
