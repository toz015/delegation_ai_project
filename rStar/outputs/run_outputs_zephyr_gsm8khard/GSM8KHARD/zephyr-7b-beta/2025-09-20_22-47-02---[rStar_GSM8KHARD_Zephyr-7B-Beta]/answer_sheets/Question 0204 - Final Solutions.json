Question: How much money did Peter spend in total, in dollars?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much money did Peter spend on popsicles?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that Peter spent money on both popsicles and ice cream bars. Let's figure out how much was spent just on popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles, and each costs $0.25. So Peter spent 20 * $0.25 = $5.00 on popsicles. The answer is: $5.00.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how much money Peter spent in total, we need to add up all the money spent. We already found out that Peter spent $5.00 on popsicles. This leaves us with finding out how much Peter spent on ice cream bars. Peter purchased 2730244 ice cream bars. Since each one costs $0.50, this means Peter spent $0.50 times 2730244. That's quite a bit to write out, so let's use an exponent instead! 2730244 times $0.50 is the same as 2730244 * $0.50^1, or $1,365,122.00 in total. Adding this amount to the $5.00 Peter spent on popsicles, we get a grand total of $1,370,122.00. The answer is: $1,370,122.00.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 8}]
