Unfortunately, our answer isn't exact yet. To be sure, let's find the smallest integer greater than or equal to x (call it j) and the largest integer less than or equal to x (call it k). Then we know that j <= x <= k. By plugging those values into our last inequality, we get $j < 3 * $4748457$ and $k < 3 * $4748457$. Since j and k cannot both be greater than $1,424,588$, there exists an integer n such that j = 3n and k = 3(n+1), where n is some positive integer. Thus, the integer j represents the closest possible value for x, and k represents the farthest possible value for x. The answer is between j and k, and that's not very helpful, but at least we know that x is close to one of those values!
