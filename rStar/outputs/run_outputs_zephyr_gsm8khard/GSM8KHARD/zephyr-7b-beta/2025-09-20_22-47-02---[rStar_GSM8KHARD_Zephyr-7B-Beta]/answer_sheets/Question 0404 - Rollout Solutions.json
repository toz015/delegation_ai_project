Condition 1:  When the water is cold, Ray can swim a mile in 16 minutes. Condition 2: When the water is warm, it takes Ray 2 minutes more than twice as long to swim a mile. Question: How many extra minutes does it take Ray to swim 3 miles when the water is hot versus cold?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many minutes does it take Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm?", "subanswer": {"text": "Twice as long as 16 minutes when the water is cold is equivalent to 32 minutes. Adding 2 more minutes makes it 34 minutes. The answer is 34.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many minutes does it take Ray to swim three miles when the water is cold?", "subanswer": {"text": "Since Ray can swim one mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold, it would take him 3 times as long or 16 * 3 = 48 minutes to swim three miles when the water is cold. The answer is 48.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {"1": "However, since we know that when the water is warm it takes Ray twice as long as when it is cold plus two additional minutes, we can create a formula for time when the water is warm. Let x be the number of additional minutes it takes for the warm water. This results in the following formula: 2(x+2) = 3*16.", "2": "Solving this equation for x: 38 = 3*16-12."}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
