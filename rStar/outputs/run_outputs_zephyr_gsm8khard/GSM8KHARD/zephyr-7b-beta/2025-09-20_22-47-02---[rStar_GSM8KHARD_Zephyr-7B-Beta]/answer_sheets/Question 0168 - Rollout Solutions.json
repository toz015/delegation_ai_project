So we find the number of ready watermelons two weeks ago by multiplying the remaining number of unharvested watermelons two weeks ago (which is 4010548) by 3/4. This gives us an approximate answer of 3015401.125 watermelons. Again, since watermelons cannot be fractional, we round down to get the whole number: 3015401 watermelons.

After another two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested. Thus, we can calculate the number of remaining watermelons as 4010547.7 * 3/4 = 3015401 watermelons.

After two months, 30% (or 0.3) of them were ready. That means that 70% (or 0.7) were not ready. The watermelons that were not ready originally is 0.7 times the original: 0.7 * 5729354. After taking away the ones that were ready, we can find out how many were left using the second condition. Initially, only 70% were left. Two weeks later, another 3/4 of those remaining were harvested. So 3/4 of 70% of the original is the percentage of remaining melons two weeks after the first harvesting. Now let's calculate how many were left: 3/4 * 0.7 * 5729354.
