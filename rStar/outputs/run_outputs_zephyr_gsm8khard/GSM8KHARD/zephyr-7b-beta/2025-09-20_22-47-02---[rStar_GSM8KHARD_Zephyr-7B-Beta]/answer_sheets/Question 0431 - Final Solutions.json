Using condition 1, let x be Jerry's current age. 5 years ago, Jerry's age was x/2. So, x/2 - 5 = Jerry's age 5 years ago. Now, using condition 2, Jerry's age 5 years ago was twice what it was 5 years before that. That means that Jerry's age 10 years ago was half of what it was 5 years ago. In other words, Jerry's age 10 years ago was (x/2)/2 = x/4.\n\nNow that we know Jerry's age both 10 years ago and 5 years ago, we can use those to calculate his age in 3 years. Here's how:\n\n- Jerry's age 10 years ago was x/4\n- Jerry's age 5 years ago was x/2\n- Jerry's age now is x\n- In three years, Jerry's age will be x plus 3 years\n\nTo calculate Jerry's age in 3 years using the information we've gathered so far, we can write", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
