First we need to find out how many pennies make up two thirds of the original 9,300 pennies. Two thirds is 2/3 which is roughly 66.6%. To get the fraction 66.6% we move the decimal point one place to the left. So two thirds of 9,300 is around 6,200 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, each dollar is worth 100 pennies. So we multiply the number of dollars by 100 to get the value in cents. Therefore 1 dollar is equal to 100 pennies. Each dollar has a value of $1. So let's calculate how many dollars worth of pennies are in 6,200 pennies. We divide the number of pennies by 100 to find the number of dollars. 6,200 / 100 is around 62 dollars.
