We have 3 zebras, and the number of stripes on the first 2 zebras are both 17. Let's call the number of stripes on the third zebra as x. So, the total number of stripes is 17*2 + x = 34 + x. Since the total number of stripes for all three zebras is divisible by 2, x is also divisible by 2. Hence, x = 2y, where y is some integer.

There are 2 zebras with 17 stripes each and 1 zebra with approximately 2445403 stripes. Thus, we can calculate the total number of stripes on all three zebras as follows: Total Number Of Stripes = 2 * 17 + 2445403 = 5612706 stripes. Next, we find out how many zebras Jane encountered. Since there are 3 zebras, the total number of zebras that Jane encountered is 3. Finally, we calculate the mean number of stripes using the formula: Mean Number Of Stripes = Total Number Of Stripes / Total Number Of Zebras. Using our calculation above, the mean number of stripes on all the zebras that Jane encountered is approximately equal to 1870902 stripes per zebra.
