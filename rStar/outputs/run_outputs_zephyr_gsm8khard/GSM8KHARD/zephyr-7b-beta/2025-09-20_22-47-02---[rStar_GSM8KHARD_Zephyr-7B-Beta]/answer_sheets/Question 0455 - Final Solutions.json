Let x be the number of years until he is tall enough. During those x years, Adam grows at a rate of 2 inches a year (or equivalently, at a rate of 24 inches per year). Using this information, we can create an equation relating Adam's height in inches, I, to x, using the formula I = 40 + 24x. Then we can use integer division to round down to whole numbers and determine the nearest possible integer value of x (the exact number of years) that results in Adam being exactly 4 feet tall. Once we have the value of x, we can calculate how many additional inches Adam would have grown during these x years. Let y be the additional inches Adam grows during these x years.

Since Adam needs to be exactly 4 feet tall by the end of these x years, his height in feet (rounded down to the nearest whole number) should be 4 feet.
