To find the discount percentage, we subtract 100 (the base percentage) from the discount amount (20). So the discount percentage is 20%. We can use this to calculate the discount amount as follows: Original price * discount percentage / 100 = discount amount. Using our numbers, we get: $22810135 * 20 / 100 = $4562027.
