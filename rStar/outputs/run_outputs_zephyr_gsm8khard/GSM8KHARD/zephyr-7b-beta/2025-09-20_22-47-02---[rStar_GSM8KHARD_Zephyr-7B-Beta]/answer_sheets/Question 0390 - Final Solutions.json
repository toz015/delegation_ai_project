To find the number of extra CDs, let's calculate how many CDs Tom buys when he doesn't buy any headphones (he buys 'n' CDs, as calculated in the previous answer). Then we compare it to the number of CDs he buys when he buys both headphones and some CDs. He buys 'n' CDs when he doesn't buy the headphones, and also he buys the headphone set and some more CDs ('m' CDs, where 'm' is a nonnegative integer), so he buys 'n' CDs plus 'm' CDs for the headphones (so he buys 'n+m' CDs). Subtracting the CDs he bought when he didn't buy the headphones, we get 'extra' CDs: 'extra' CDs = 'n+m' CDs - 'n' CDs = 'm' CDs.

In addition, it should be noted that the expression $4-n$ is also greater than zero, meaning that Tom cannot buy more CDs than he could with the same amount of money he spent on headphones (in other words, no matter how many CDs he wants to buy, Tom cannot afford more than $x/4$ CDs).
