So to find out how many bags of oats would hold all these oats, divide the total oats consumed per day by the number of pounds in one bag. (total oats consumed per day) / 50 = (number of bags needed). Then let's find the number of pounds in all these bags. Number of pounds in all these bags = (number of bags", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How many bags of oats does Uncle Ben require to feed his horses for a period of five days?", "subanswer": {"text": "In 5 days, Uncle Ben's horses consume 9593040 * 5 = 47965200 pounds of oats.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are 959304 horses. That means in one day, all the horses together eat 2897520 pounds of oats (as calculated above). As we're considering a period of five days, let's calculate the total number of pounds of oats required over those five days. It's the product of pounds of oats consumed per day (calculated above) and number of days (5), which comes out to 14487600 pounds. To find out how many bags of oats we need, divide this value by the weight of each bag (which is 50 pounds per bag). 14487600 pounds divided by 50 pounds per bag equals 289752 bags.
