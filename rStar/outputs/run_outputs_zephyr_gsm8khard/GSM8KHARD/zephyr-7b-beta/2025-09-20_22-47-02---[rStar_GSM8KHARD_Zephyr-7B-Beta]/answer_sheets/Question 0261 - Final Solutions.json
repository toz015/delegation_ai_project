Since the middle tree is 5 feet taller, we have X = 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. Also, since the shortest tree is twice as tall as the two shorter trees put together, we can write this mathematically: shortest tree = 2*(shortest tree + middle tree)/3. Simplifying this gives us: 6 = 2/3*(X + X - 6). Solving for X, we get X = 9 feet. Now, let's find out how tall the tallest tree is. The formula for the tallest tree is double the height of both shorter trees put together. So the tallest tree is twice the height of the combined height of the two shorter trees.
