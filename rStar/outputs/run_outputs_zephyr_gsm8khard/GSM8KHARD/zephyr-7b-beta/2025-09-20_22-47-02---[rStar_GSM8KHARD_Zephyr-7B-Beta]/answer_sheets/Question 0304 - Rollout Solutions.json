Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To reach the airport, it takes 10 minutes to travel. Toby intends to finish the book before leaving, but he also wants to be at the airport in time. We're going to find out how many pages Toby still needs to read when he gets ready to leave. Toby knows that the book has 831007 pages and that each page has 200 words. So we can find out the total number of words in the book like this: numberOfWords = 831007 * 200 = 1662014000. When Toby starts getting ready to leave, let's call the number of pages remaining x. Since each page has 200 words, we can find out how many words are remaining using the same formula: numberOfWordsLeft = x * 200.

Condition 1:  The book that Toby is reading has a total of 831007 pages. Condition 2:  Each page contains approximately 200 words. Condition 3:  Toby reads at a pace of 300 words per minute. Condition 4:  He intends to depart within one hour of finishing the book. Condition 5:  It requires ten minutes to travel to the airport.

Condition 1 tells us that the whole book has 831007 pages. Condition 2 tells us how many words are on one page. So if we divide the total number of words by the total number of pages, we can find out roughly how many words are in the entire book. So 831007 divided by about 200 words per page is approximately 415504 books worth of words. Let's call this X. Condition 3 tells us how many words Toby reads in one minute. So let's divide X (the total number of words) by 300 (Toby's reading speed) to see how long it takes him to read the whole book. This would be the number of minutes it takes Toby to finish the entire book. Rounding up, this comes out to around 142351 minutes, or about 237252 seconds. Condition 4 tells us that Toby plans to leave exactly one hour after finishing the book. So if we subtract 60 minutes (an hour) from the number of seconds it took him to read, we can determine how", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
