Condition 1 says that Dean gets $28 from his mother. Condition 3 says his mother also gave him an extra $10. So he has $28 + $10 = $38. With these funds, Dean spent all of it buying toy cars and teddy bears. Let's assume we don't know how many of each he bought. Let's call the number of toy cars \"x\" and the number of teddy bears \"y\". From condition 2, we know that the price per toy car is $2 and per teddy bear is $1. Let's set up an equation using our variables: 2*x + 1*y = 38. Solve for y: y = (38 - 2*x) / 1. Since we want to find out how many teddy bears Dean bought, we substitute x into the formula and solve for y.

Step 5: Let's plug x back into the first equation we made to find out how many teddy bears Dean bought (call this value \"z\"): z = (38 - 2*(7 - z/2)) / 1. Simplify: z = (38 - 14 + z)/2 = 14 + z/2. Step 6: Add the results from steps 4 and 5: x + z = (7 - z/2) + (14 + z/2) = 21. But we know that Dean didn't buy any more toys or bears than he already did!
