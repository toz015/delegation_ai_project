The latter is easy: since this includes tricycles as well as bicycles, we assume two tires per cyclist.

Let's assume that it takes one tire inflation for every person who brings their tri-cycle in, since we don't have specific information about how many people came. Then, the number of tires inflated is the same as the number of people who came: 3926041.

We are trying to figure out how much money she earned from providing this service on that particular day. First we calculate how many tires need to be inflated. From condition 1, we know that she inflates bikes for children in her neighborhood. Since the first day only involves bi-cycles, there will be 5 times 2 tires per person, or a total of 10 tires inflated on day one. We use this formula to find the amount of money she made on day one: $10 = 5 individuals * 2 tires/person * $0.25 per tire = $5 * 10 tires inflated. So that is $50 for day one. Day two includes all three types of cycles: bi-, tri-, and uni-. Using our formula again, we can find the number of tires inflated on day two: $39.26 = 3926041 individuals * (2 tires/bi-cycle + 3 tires/tri-cycle + 1 tire/uni-cycle) * $0.25 per tire.

Later, 3926041 individuals brought their tri-cycles for inflation (Condition 4), but we don't know how many tires are on a tricycle. Let's assume that there are 3 tires per tricycle. So the number of tires inflated would be 3926041 * 3 = 11781123 tires. That would mean 11781123 * 0.25 = $294528.13 was earned from those tires being inflated.

On the second day, there were 3926041 individuals who brought their tri-cycles for inflation. Since each tricycle has three wheels, which is actually three tires per wheel, that's a total of 3 times the number of tricycles times three tires for each tire. Let's call the number of tricycles 'x'. So we have 3*x*3 = num_tires. The answer is: 9x.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 9}]
