Let's call zaid's salary X. Then 1/4 of it goes to rent, so that is X/4. Next, let's figure out how much he spends on car fuel. That would be 1/3 of what's left of his salary after rent. So we have 3 parts left: (X - X/4) which would be 3X/4. We know from earlier that half of this amount goes to his favorite charity, so that's 3X/8. Now we need to calculate how much money he gives his daughter for weekly expenses, which we'll call Y. Finally, we need to calculate how much money his wife gets for groceries and household goods, which we'll call W. So let's put all those calculations together: X/4 + (3X/4 - X/4*3/2) - Y - W = 2300 (his daughter's and wife's allocations). Simplifying, we get: X = 13333.33 dollars.
