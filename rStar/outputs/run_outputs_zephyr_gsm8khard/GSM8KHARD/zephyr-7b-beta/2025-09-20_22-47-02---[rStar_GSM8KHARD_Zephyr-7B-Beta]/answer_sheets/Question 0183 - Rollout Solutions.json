To find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday, we need to know how many cookies her sister ate, since we know Sue ate four times as many. We found out that her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 2508320 (a very large number) on Tuesday. We can find out how many cookies her sister ate on Tuesday using this information. First, let's figure out how many cookies her sister ate on Monday (let's call that x). When she eats four times as many as Sue, and Sue eats 4 times as many as her sister on Monday, it means that Sue eats one-fourth as many cookies as her sister on Monday. Since we also know that Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, we can use that fact along with our knowledge about how many cookies her sister ate on Tuesday, to figure out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.

Her sister ate 2508320 cookies on Tuesday. So we can write z as twice that amount: z = 2 * 2508320. Now let's figure out how many calories Sue ate on both days. On Monday, Sue ate y cookies, and each cookie had 200 calories. So she ate 200 * y = m calories. Her sister ate x cookies, so she ate 200 * x = s calories.
