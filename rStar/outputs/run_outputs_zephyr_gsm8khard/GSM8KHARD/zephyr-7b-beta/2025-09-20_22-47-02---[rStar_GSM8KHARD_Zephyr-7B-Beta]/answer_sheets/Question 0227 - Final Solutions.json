Plugging these formulas into our equation above, we get: (price - 0.3333333333333333) + 0.3333333333333333 = price / (1 - discount%) Subtracting price from both sides: (price - 0.3333333333333333) - price = price / (1 - discount%) - price In other words, the discounted price of the milk is equal to the price divided by (1 - discount%). Since the original price of the milk was not explicitly asked, we just want to find the original price of 1 pack of milk. So the original price of one pack of milk is the price divided by (1 - discount%), which is: Original_price = price / (1 - discount%) Simplifying the expression for the original price of ice cream, we get: Original_price of ice cream = X / (1 - 0.15) = 1.15X Now we can use these formulas to calculate the cost of buying multiple items. The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream is simply twice the cost of one tub: Cost of 2 tubs = 2 * original_price = 2 * 1.15X Cost of 4 packets of milk is calculated by multiplying the price per unit times the number of units: Cost of 4 packets = 4 * Original_price of 1 packet After substituting the expressions found earlier, we get: Cost of 4 packets = 4 * price / (1 - discount%) = 4 * X / (1 - discount%) Now we can answer the question: How", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "How much will you save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk?", "subanswer": {"text": "First, let's calculate the total cost of buying everything.

Each packet of milk costs $y+$1 after the $1 discount, where y is the original price of a packet of milk. Therefore, 4 packets of milk cost $4y$. Let's call the total amount spent s. Then s = $26 + $4y. Now we want to find the difference between the original total price and the new total price after getting the discount. Let's call this difference d. Then d is equal to the original price minus the new price after the discount. So d = $26 + $4y - ($26 - $1) - $4y - $4 = -$4, which means that we're spending $4 more than what we should have spent without any discount. However, this doesn't make sense since we're assuming that the discount is $1 per packet of milk, but the actual discount is larger than $1 for some reason. To fix this problem, we need to replace the $1 discount by $-4$ instead. By doing so, we get d = -$4. Note that the original price is always positive, whereas the discount can be both positive and negative. So by setting the discount to $-4$, we ensure that the new price is also positive.

To fix this issue, we need to add back the $4 discount that we previously removed, which gives us the following expression for the saving: $4$ - $4$. Adding this to the previous expression, we finally obtain the saving s_saved = -$4$ - $4$ + $4$ = 0. In other words, we're not saving anything at all.
