Each bale weighs 75 pounds. The farmer bought 40 bales, so he has 40 * 75 = 3000 pounds of hay. To calculate how many trips it takes, we divide the weight of hay by the weight that the truck can hold at once. Let's call that \"x\". X is the number of trips needed. 3000 / x = 2250. Solve this equation for x. 3000 / 2250 = x. X is approximately 1.32 trips. This is because the truck holds approximately 2250 pounds, which isn't an exact multiple of the 75 pound hay bales. Rounding up or down would make the answer more accurate. However, since we know the truck can't hold exactly 3000 pounds, we may want to round our answer to the nearest integer.
