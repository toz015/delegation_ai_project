Let's calculate!\n\nThe number of people who were not expelled because of the reasons mentioned before is equal to the total number of people expelled minus the ones who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence concerning products on offer. That is, 50 - (3 + four times this number - 5 + 3870666 times the number of shoplifters) = X. \n\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain: X = 50 - (3 + 16t - 5 + 3870666c) = 31 - 3770661t + 3870666c, where t represents the number of shoplifters and c is the number of people expelled due to physical violence concerning products on offer.\n\nNow let's figure", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 12}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
