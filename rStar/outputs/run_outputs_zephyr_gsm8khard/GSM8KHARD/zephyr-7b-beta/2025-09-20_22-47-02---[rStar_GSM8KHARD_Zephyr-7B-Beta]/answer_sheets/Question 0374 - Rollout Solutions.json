Let's say Sophia bought x potatoes. Then Rose bought 4x potatoes. In total, they bought (x + 4x) = 5x potatoes. They also bought y onions, which meant (y + 4y) = 5y onions. Since they spent the same amount, we can say 5x * price(potato) = 5y * price(onion). Let's say price(potato) = p and price(onion) = o. Then we have 5xp = 5yo, or xp = yo. This means x = y/4 because we know that the ratio of the number of potatoes to the number of onions was 1:4. So we can find x: x = y/4, which means x = y/4. Now let's substitute this back into our equation about total potatoes and onions: (x + 4x) + (y + 4y) = 5(x + y).
