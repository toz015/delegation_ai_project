Mrs. Sherman made a dozen rolls, which is 12 rolls. She fed all but the last roll to her children, so she fed 11*1=11 rolls to her children. She broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces for the chickens. Since each roll was broken into 8 pieces, that's 8 times as many rolls as the original roll. That's the same as dividing the remaining rolls by 8. So she divided the remaining roll (the last one) by 8 and fed that many rolls to her children. That's equivalent to feeding 1 roll to her children. So when she broke each remaining roll into 8 pieces, it was equivalent to feeding 1 roll to her children. So if she gave 11*1 rolls to her children, then she fed a total of 11 rolls to her children.

There were originally 12 rolls, and she fed all but the last roll to her children. So she broke the last roll into 8 pieces. Altogether, she fed a total of 8 times as many rolls to the chickens as she would've fed to the chickens if she hadn't broken any rolls into pieces. In other words, she had fed 8 times as many rolls to the chickens as the number of pieces that she fed to the chickens. Let's call the number of rolls that she fed to the chickens X. Then the number of pieces that she fed to the chickens is 8X. But she broke each remaining roll into 8 pieces for the chickens. So let's call the number of remaining rolls Y. Then the number of pieces that she fed to the chickens is 8Y. Since each roll was broken into 8 pieces, there were a total of 8 times as many pieces as rolls. So the number of pieces that she fed to the chickens is 8X. And the number of pieces that she fed to the chickens is also equal to 8Y, since she broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces. By equating these two expressions, we get that 8X = 8Y. This equation can be simplified by dividing both sides by 8 to get X = Y. So the number of rolls that she fed to the chickens is the same as the number of remaining rolls. The remaining rolls were 1 roll, because she fed that one roll to her children. So the number of rolls that she fed to the chickens is 1 roll. The answer is: 8.
