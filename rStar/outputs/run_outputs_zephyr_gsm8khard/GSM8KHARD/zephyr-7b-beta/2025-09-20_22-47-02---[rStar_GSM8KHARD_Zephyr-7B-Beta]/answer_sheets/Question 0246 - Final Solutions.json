Let's call that quantity Q. Mason also wants to make one batch of fudge which requires 70 ounces of sugar according to condition 2. We can write an equation using these amounts: Q + 70 = total number of ounces of sugar needed. To find the total number of ounces of sugar needed, we need to know how many suckers Mason wants to make. Let's say he wants to make X suckers. Each sucker requires 30/X ounces of sugar (according to hint 1). So the total number of ounces of sugar required for all the suckers is X times the number of ounces required per sucker: X * (30/X) = 30X/X = 30. Adding this to the amount required for the fudge, we get the total number of ounces of sugar required: X * (30/X) + 70 = total number of ounces of sugar needed.
