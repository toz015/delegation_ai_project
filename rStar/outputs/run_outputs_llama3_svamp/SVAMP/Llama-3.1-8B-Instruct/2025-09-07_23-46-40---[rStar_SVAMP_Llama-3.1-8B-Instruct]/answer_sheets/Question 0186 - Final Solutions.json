There were originally 15 crackers. After distributing them equally among 5 friends and having 10 left over, we know that the number of crackers left was a multiple of 5 (because it could have been any multiple of 5). Let's write this as an equation: n = 5x + 10, where x is the number of crackers each friend received, and n is the total number of crackers distributed. Since all 15 crackers were used up (with none left), n = 15. Plugging this into our equation above, we have: 15 = 5x + 10. Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us: 5 = 5x.
