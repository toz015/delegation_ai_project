The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches more than the grasshopper, so it was 19 + 10 = 29 inches. However, we're asked for the distance the frog jumped relative to its own position which seems to be a trick. Let's continue to analyze the problem. The mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog. Since we know the mouse jumped 20 inches more than the frog, let's say 'x' is the number of inches the frog jumped and 'y' is the number of inches the mouse jumped. We already determined y as (x+20). The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. And since the frog jumped 10 inches more than the grasshopper, we can determine x as (19 + 10) or (29). But we want the distance the frog jumped itself not relative to the other creatures. Therefore, the correct answer remains 29 inches.
