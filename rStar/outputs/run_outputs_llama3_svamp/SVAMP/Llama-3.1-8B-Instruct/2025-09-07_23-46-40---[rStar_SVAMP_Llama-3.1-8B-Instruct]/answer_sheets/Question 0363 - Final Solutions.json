We can first determine that the total number of fish initially was 16 + 71 = 87. This is because we know that Paige started with 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. Condition 2 states that due to stray cats eating them, she ends up with only 2 fish left. So in total, 2 fish are remaining. Therefore, the number of fish eaten would be the difference between the original total (87) and the remaining fish count (2). That means the number of fish eaten (disappeared) equals 87 - 2 = 85. Since initially, Paige had 16 goldfish, to find out how many goldfish vanished, subtract the remaining amount of goldfish from the initial number: 16 - 0 = 16 (all goldfish disappeared). However, since the task asks us to calculate how many goldfish from her initial population DISAPPEARED, it implies all of the goldfish must have disappeared to satisfy the condition. So if there were no other option than 16 goldfish or some other number of non-goldfish to disapper, then 16 could be correct but that is not what the task says we need to find.
