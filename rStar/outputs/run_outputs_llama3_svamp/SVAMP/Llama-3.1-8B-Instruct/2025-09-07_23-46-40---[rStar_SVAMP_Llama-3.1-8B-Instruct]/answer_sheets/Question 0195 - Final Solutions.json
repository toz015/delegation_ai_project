There are 29 apples remaining. Since each tree has 7 apples remaining, the number of apples taken is equal to the difference between the number of apples that existed when we started (initial total number of apples per tree) and the current number of apples per tree. Thus we have 7 - x = 29 / 4 where x is the initial number of apples on each tree. Solving the equation yields x = 7 - (29 / 4). First multiply both sides of the equation by 4 and you get 4x = 28 - 29. Then simplify the right side to get 4x = -1. Finally divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find x = (-1)/4. However, the problem stated earlier says \"She picked 7 apples from each of her trees\", which means our new value for x is NOT -1/4, but rather 7, since it's the initial number of apples that was picked from the tree and placed into the bucket. Let's verify our calculations: there would indeed be 4 * 7 = 28 apples if we had simply multiplied the number of apples picked by the number of trees, however, we should remember that our value for x represents the number of apples left ON THE TREE, so there actually WERE 28 apples LEFT on the 4 trees (since each tree initially had 7 apples). And indeed, 4 * 7 = 28. To find out the initial number of apples on the trees and also the number of apples taken, we must do some algebraic manipulation. Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 and you get 4x = 28 - 29 = -1. However, our value for x doesn't mean anything because we didn't take any variables or unknowns, so let's continue: x = 7 and the initial number of apples was indeed 4 * 7 = 28.

However, since she picked 7 apples per tree and there are 4 trees, that would be 4 * 7 = 28. But that's what the question says, not what we calculated! In fact, if you check your work, you'll see I made an error. Let's redo it. There are 4 trees and they originally had 7 apples per tree, for a total of 4 * 7 = 28. Now they have 29 apples left. That means there must have been 1 more apple left when Rachel started (which would make sense). We know Rachel picked 7 apples off each tree. That's 4 trees * 7 apples/tree = 28 apples. But what about those extra 1 apples? Since the problem said she picked 7 apples off of each tree, that implies the other apple wasn't picked. And indeed it wasn't! So let's get back to Rachel's total number of apples. Originally there were 4 trees * 7 apples/tree = 28 apples. So she must have picked 28 apples! Wait...that doesn't seem right. Let me try again. She picks 7 apples from each tree, for a total of 4 * 7 = 28. But wait, it says she picked all of them off all of them! So how could she pick all of them and leave 1 behind?! Oh...I see my mistake! Since there's only 1 apple left over, the trees didn't have enough to give her 4 sets of 7. Which means they only gave her 3 sets of 7 (21) and 1 other apple (28-21=7). She must have picked 21+7=28. No...not even close!  Since I just said that 4 trees with 7 apples on each tree will have 28 apples in all, and that's exactly what Rachel got, the answer is indeed 28, but that doesn't make sense! The correct way to figure this out is to realize that there's only one set of 7 apples (since there's 1 apple left over), meaning she picked 4 trees * 1 set of 7/apple = 28.
