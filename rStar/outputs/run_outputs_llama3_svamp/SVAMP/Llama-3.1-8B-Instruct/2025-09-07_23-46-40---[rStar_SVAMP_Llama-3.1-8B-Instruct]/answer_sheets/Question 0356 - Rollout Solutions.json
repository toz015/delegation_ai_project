We know that Marco and his dad picked 24 pounds of strawberries. They lost 9 pounds and are left with 3 pounds.

This isn't possible as you cannot lose less than nothing, so this is likely a trick condition. We can instead look at it like Marco's dad also lost 9 pounds. Thus, if Marco's dad had 'x' pounds initially, then after picking 24, we'd get the equation x + 3 (since he's the one who lost 9 pounds) = 24, so we solve for x: 24 - 3 = 21.
