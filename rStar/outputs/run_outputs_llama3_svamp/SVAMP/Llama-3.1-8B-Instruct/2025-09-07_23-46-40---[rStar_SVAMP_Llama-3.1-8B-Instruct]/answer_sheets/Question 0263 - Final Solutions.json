Let me know if you'd like further assistance. \nYou could also try using other examples as well to get better experience for this kind of problems. For example, let's say you want to find out how old someone is after they have lived 24 years. You just need to add the year they were born to the amount of time they have lived. That's 24 + their age when they were born. If you found the solution you probably already know the answer because you're thinking mathematically. This is good practice. Practice makes perfect!
