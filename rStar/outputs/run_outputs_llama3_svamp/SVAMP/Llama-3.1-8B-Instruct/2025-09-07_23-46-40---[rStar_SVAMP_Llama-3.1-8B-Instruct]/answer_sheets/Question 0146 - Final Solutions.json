But we can still solve it using algebra.\n\nLet's say the depth of the water is d. We know d is directly proportional to Dean's height (which is 9). That means there exists a constant, c, so that d = 9c. We also know that d = 10 * 9. To find the value of c, we can substitute in what we know about d into our formula: d = 9c becomes 10 * 9 = 9c. Solving this equation for c, we get c = 10. So the equation for d becomes d = 9 * 10, which simplifies to d = 90. Therefore, the water is 90 feet deep, and Dean is 9 feet tall.
