Since we want to know how many books he sold, we need to determine how many items sold were actually books. We can figure this out by looking at what he had left. 36 items were left after selling all those other things. Of these, 13 were books. Therefore, the rest of them (i.e. 36 - 13) must have been pens. Now we just divide the number of pens by the number of pens per item: 23 \u00f7 1 = 23. But if we multiply that by the # of items he had left, it says there were only 23 items sold which weren't books. That means he must have sold all 95 - 23 = 72 pens first, so we don't even need to consider them.
