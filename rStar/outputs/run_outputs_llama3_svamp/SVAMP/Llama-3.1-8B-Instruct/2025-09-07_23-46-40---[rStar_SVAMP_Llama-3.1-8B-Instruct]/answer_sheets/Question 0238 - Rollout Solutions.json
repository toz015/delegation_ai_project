However, this doesn't seem right since you cannot divide something into an integer number of parts like this if you know what I mean. Let me try again. We know the machine works at a rate of 3 shirts per minute, let's call the unknown time t. Then 3t=9 (because it made 9 shirts) and t=9/3=3. This seems suspicious. Wait, perhaps I've made another mistake? Ah, the issue here is not the math itself, but rather my interpretation of it. Let's rephrase our problem slightly. Yesterday, it made 9 shirts. Today, it made 44 shirts. Thus, since 44 shirts is 15 shirts more than 29 shirts (i.e., 3x5), then yesterday it had to be 3 times some amount x, such that when multiplied by 5, it would equal 29. And when subtracted from 9, the resulting difference should also be divisible by 3. The reason is that, just as 44/3 has remainder 2, 9/x has remainder 0 when divided by 3, meaning x must be divisible by 3. Thus, we set up our equation as follows: x * 5 = 29 and (9-x)/3 = 0 (the first equation makes no sense). In order to meet both conditions simultaneously, x must equal 5.7. But we already see why this solution will fail later in the course of the explanation. If our answer isn't divisible by 3, then the last statement we wrote is false. We can find the value of x as follows. First, we note that both equations must be met simultaneously. To get the number of shirts we need in order to find x, we take 9 shirts and change it to a multiple of 3 using simple subtraction. Thus, we get 9 shirts = (6+3)=6 shirts + 3 shirts. In addition to the 3 shirts, the machine made 44 shirts. So we can determine the total number of shirts it made by adding 6 shirts and 3 shirts. In other words, we're trying to solve the following equation: 3 shirts + 3 shirts + 6 shirts + x shirts = 44 shirts.
