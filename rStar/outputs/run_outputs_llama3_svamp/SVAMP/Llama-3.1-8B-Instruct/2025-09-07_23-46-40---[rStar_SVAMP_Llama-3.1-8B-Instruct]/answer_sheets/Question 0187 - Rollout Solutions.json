Jason now has 78 dollars. Fred now has 21 dollars. Together they had 21 + 78 = 99 dollars now. Last week, together they had 99 + 10 = 109 dollars. Since we don't know how much money Jason had last week, let's find out how much money Fred had last week. We already know Fred had 114 dollars last week. Therefore Jason had 109 - 114 = -5 dollars last week, but since it doesn't make sense for someone to have negative dollars, our previous statement that the combined amount was 109 is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem. Let's say Jason had J dollars last week. This means Fred had 114 - J dollars last week. Over the weekend, they earned 107 dollars (the difference between what they have now and last week).  So we can set up an equation: (114-J) + J = 21 + 78. We simplify this to 114 = 99. But since 114 > 99, this cannot be true. However, if we subtract 7 from both sides, we get 107=92 which is also not true.
