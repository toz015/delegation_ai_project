Initially, Paul had 95 pens and 153 books. After selling items, he was left with 23 pens. That means he sold 95 - 23 = 72 pens. The problem mentions nothing about him selling pens, so we assume all pen sales are irrelevant to our solution. We need to calculate book sales instead. To find out how many books he sold, subtract the amount he had left (13) from the initial amount (153). So 153 - 13 is 140. The answer is: 140. \n\nHowever, note the question asks about how many books were sold. To get this, you'd actually look at how many were initially owned versus what remained. To determine book sales, it would be best to figure that out through using condition 2's data as well. To correct my previous calculation we can see he initially had 153 books. At the end he had 13. So the difference between those amounts is the number of books he sold. Let's recalculate: 153 - 13 = 140.
