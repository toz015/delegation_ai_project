The equation states that there are 697 girls, which is 228 more than the number of boys (b). So we can set up an equation, 697 = b + 228. To find b, we need to isolate it.

Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can say the number of girls is equal to the number of boys plus 228 (b+228). We know this equals 697 girls.

But since you can't have .75 boys, we must round down to 234 and add one boy to make 235 boys. However, if you keep going, we find out that if we subtract 228 from 697 we get 469 which divided by 2 is 234.5, which when rounded down is 234, but adding one makes it 235 not accounting for a whole person so we need to divide 469 by 2, and then we get 234.5.

However, since you cannot have half a boy, there seems to be something wrong in my calculations... I made an error when translating the equation into code. It should read 697 - x = x - 228 instead because there are 228 more girls than boys, not 228 fewer. This makes 697 - x = x - 228 or 697 + 228 = 2x; therefore, 925 = 2x, so x = 925 / 2 = 462.5. As with the previous solution, you cannot have half a boy, which implies the information provided is contradictory. There are 697 girls, and there are 228 more girls than boys; this means there cannot be any boys if the statement about there being 228 more girls than boys is correct.
