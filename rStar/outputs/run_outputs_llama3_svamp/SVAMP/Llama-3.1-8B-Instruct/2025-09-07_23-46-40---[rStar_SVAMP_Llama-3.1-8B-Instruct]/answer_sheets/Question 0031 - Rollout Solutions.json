That means she added 17 - 15 = 2 roses. Since she also added 34 orchids, she added 2 roses. However, the correct way to find out is to calculate the total increase of flowers and then find what percentage of that increase came from roses or orchids. To do that, let's first calculate the total increase. Initially there were 15 roses and 62 orchids, now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids. The total number of flowers went from 77 (15+62) to 113 (17+96), an increase of 36 flowers. Of those 36 new flowers, 2 were roses and 34 were orchids. The ratio of roses to total flowers went from 15/77 to 17/113. The difference between these ratios represents the proportion of flowers that were roses. We need to solve the equation (17/113 - 15/77)/(1-(17/113)) = 2/36 to confirm if our initial assumption is correct or not. Simplifying the equation yields 2/(113*77/11377 - 17/113^2) = 2/36.
