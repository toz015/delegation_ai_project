To find out how many he actually gave away, we first need to calculate how many crayons he could have given out. Since he only had 428 and he couldn't give away more crayons than what he had, it means that the maximum crayons he could give would still be less than or equal to 428. But since it's not possible for him to give away all 428 crayons (he would be left with none), we assume he gave away as many as he could which would be the lesser number between 571 and 428. The smaller number between these two numbers is 428. The difference between the numbers of crayons he gave away (which is 428) and the numbers of crayons he lost is 571 - 161 = 410.
