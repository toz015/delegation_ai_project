Baker initially made 13 cakes, then he sold 91. But first we need to find out how many cakes baker had before buying the additional ones. To do this, let's calculate how many cakes baker had after selling some but before buying any additional ones. Since baker initially made 13 and then sold 91, he didn't have any of the initial 13 cakes left, because he sold all of them. Before buying more cakes, he was left with no initial cakes (those that he had initially), but rather only the ones he bought afterwards which wasn't any, so it still stands that he doesn't have any of those 13. Next, let's see how many cakes baker actually ended up with after buying more cakes. Since he bought 154 new cakes, if he already had none (as we determined earlier) then he simply ended up with 154 cakes. Now let's compare how many cakes baker bought vs sold.
