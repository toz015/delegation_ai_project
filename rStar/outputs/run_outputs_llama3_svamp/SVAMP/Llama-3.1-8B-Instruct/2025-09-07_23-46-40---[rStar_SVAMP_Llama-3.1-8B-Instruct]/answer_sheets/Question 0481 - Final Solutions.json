Another possible interpretation is using proportionality, in which case we get the same result when letting 1 represent 'Ron', but using x instead of r we still have w/x = 12/1.

If x is the height of the person and y is the depth of the water, then according to the statement x = ky or y/x = k where k is some constant. Then, if r is Ron's height and d is the depth of the water, rd/k = r, therefore we conclude the depth of the water is also directly proportional to Ron's height (which was known) meaning the ratio of d/r should be the same in both cases when using the same formula (using both Ron and Dean), thus we will use the values of r/d and (r - 11)/d to determine k. Thus, (r - 11)d/r = kd/(r - 11) = k. So now we can write  rd/(r-11) = k. And we already determined r so now we just plug in those numbers for our variables. We get ((12)(d))/(12-11) = k.
