Each part represents the amount used in one necklace, so 2 divided by 32 represents how much of a single bead goes into each necklace. The answer is indeed: 2.

Thus, the actual solution isn't about multiplying anything but about finding the amount of beads per necklace which in this case happens to work out to being equivalent to using all of the available 2 beads across all 32 necklaces.
