He had 73 books left, meaning he sold 108 - 73 = 35 books during the garage sale. But we already know he gave 35 to his friend. Since he actually only had 73 left after giving some away, he actually sold 108 - 73 = 35 books, which is incorrect, I made a mistake here. Let me think again... If Paul had 73 books left after the garage sale, he must have had 108 books before the sale. But then where do those 35 books go? Oh wait, they don't go anywhere, they just aren't part of the count anymore! Paul started with 108 books and ended up with 62, which means he didn't sell all 35 books, it just means he didn't include them when counting what's left. So now let's say the number of books Paul sold is x. Then we can write an equation: 108 - x = 73. Solving for x, we get x = 35. No, that can't be right! I already said I made a mistake earlier. Think about the problem differently. We know Paul had 73 books left. He started with 108 books. And he also had 62 books left. These numbers can help us figure out how many books he sold. We can set up an equation based on these numbers: 108 - (number sold) = 73, but that doesn't make sense because we already know how many books he had left, not the number sold. Instead, let's try using the final number of books he had, which is 62. So, we have: 108 - (number given away) = 73; 73 - (number sold) = 62. The first equation says 35 books were given away, but that's wrong again! That's the same as saying 35 books weren't sold, not that they were! Ugh, I'm getting confused now! Okay, let me take a deep breath and think this one out carefully! We know that Paul started with 108 books, had 35 taken from him, and then had 62 left over.

So before selling or giving away any books, he had 62 + (the number of books he gave away) = 108 books. He gave away 35 books. So the number of books he gave away must be 108 - 62 - 46 = 0 books (but those aren't among the choices), or 108 - 62 = 46. However he only gave away 35. This makes 108 - 62 = 46 books the number of books he sold, which we've found already, not the number of books he gave away. Therefore, since 108 - 62 = 46, we need to solve the equation 62 + x = 108, where x represents the number of books he gave to his friend. Subtracting 62 from both sides leaves us with x = 46.
