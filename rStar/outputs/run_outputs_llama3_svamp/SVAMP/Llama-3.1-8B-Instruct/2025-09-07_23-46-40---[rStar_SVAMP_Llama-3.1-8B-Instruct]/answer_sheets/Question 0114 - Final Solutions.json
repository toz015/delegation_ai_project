However, we also know that Faye placed all the pencils that she had, which was 84. Therefore, Faye didn't use up all the pencils when she made the 3 full rows. We need to add the remaining pencils to our result. We do this by calculating how many pencils were left over after making the rows.

Then we know what she has in those rows. But since we're looking for the overall count, let's just add the pencils in the rows and the ones in the packs together. We know from condition 1 that each row holds 22 pencils. To determine the total number of rows possible, we divide the number of pencils obtained from packs (which is 84) by the number of pencils per row (which is 22), which equals approximately 3 full sets of rows. This means she can fill up 3 whole rows (that would use 66 pencils). Now, we still have some pencils left over because 84 isn't evenly divisible by 22. There will be a remainder of 18 pencils, meaning Faye ends up with an extra 18 pencils not included in any of her rows. In conclusion, she has 3 fully filled rows containing 3 * 22 = 66 pencils plus the leftover 18 pencils. Hence, the total number of pencils she owns is 66 + 18 = 84.
