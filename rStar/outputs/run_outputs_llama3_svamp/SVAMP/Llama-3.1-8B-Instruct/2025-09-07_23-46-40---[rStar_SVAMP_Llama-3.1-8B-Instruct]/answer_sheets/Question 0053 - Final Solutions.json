This will give you the number of bags, not the number of candies. Let's try again! To find out how many bags Frank would have, we need to know how many candies are required per bag, which is already given as 11. If we want to find the total number of candies required to fill some bags, we could multiply the number of bags by 11. But since we're starting with 22 candies, we'll actually want to find out how many times 11 fits into 22, which leads us to dividing 22 by 11... Wait, let me correct myself! We don't actually need to add anything to 22 pieces of candy; we just need to see how many sets of 11 fit into 22. That is done by division: 22 \u00f7 11 = 2. So, 2 bags can be filled completely, and you'd still have 0 candies left over. The answer is 2. However, according to the format required, it should be stated in a specific way: Frank would have 2 bags, but that isn't the question asked here. We are looking for the number that should be added to 22 pieces of candy to get the number of bags. Actually, we're trying to find how many bags can be made from 22 pieces of candy. So, the answer to the modified question is the value we found earlier: we'd need to fill 2 bags completely and then realize you don't add any candy to get a bag. So in actuality, no number should be added. Instead, we're taking a remainder of sorts in our calculation, the number of whole bags. I know, it's confusing. The real key might be thinking about filling all possible bags. In that case, we find that 11 \u00d7 2 = 22. This means all 22 pieces of candy can be placed in exactly 2 bags (since 2 bags times 11 is equal to 22). In fact, adding nothing makes perfect sense because you aren\u2019t adding to a sum like you\u2019re in an addition puzzle, you\u2019re finding out how many groups of items you can form with those 22 items. You can form 2 full groups of items. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t add anything to the 22, you simply look at it.
