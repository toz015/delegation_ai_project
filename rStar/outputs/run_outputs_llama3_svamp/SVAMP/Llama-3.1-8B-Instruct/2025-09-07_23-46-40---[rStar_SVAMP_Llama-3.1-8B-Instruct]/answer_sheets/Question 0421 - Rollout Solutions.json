Since 8 is greater than 7, there are indeed positive differences. For instance, if we were looking at the difference between how many bags she found (7) and the number of bags she should have had on Monday (the original amount), then we could do that subtraction operation as described previously. However, the question asks about how many more bags she had on Monday, not how many fewer bags she had. Because the question states she had MORE bags on Monday, we don't have to perform any subtraction. Instead, we can state directly what the question asks: \"how many more bags did she have on monday,\" which we've established as equal to the number stated in the first part of her collection. Thus, our conclusion is correct despite using subtraction in the explanation. We actually know exactly how many bags she had and there wasn't even any reason to calculate the difference because we just needed to recall the information about her having more bags."}}}, "rollout_id": 4}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling.
