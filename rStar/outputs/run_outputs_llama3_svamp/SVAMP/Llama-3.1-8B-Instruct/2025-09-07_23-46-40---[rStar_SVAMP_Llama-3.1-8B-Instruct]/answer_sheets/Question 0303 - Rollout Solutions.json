Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so if we knew how many peaches Jill has (even if it is negative), we could solve this problem. But we'll just use what we already know and say that since Jill has -7 peaches, that's not correct because you cannot have a negative amount of something. We would actually need to rephrase the problem to get rid of the confusing statement about Jill having a negative amount of peaches. Assuming we rephrased the problem, the original problem says Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill.

That makes 11 + 12 = 23 peaches. Jake now has 11 + 12 = 23 peaches. To find out how many peaches Jill has more than Jake, subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches: 7 - 19 = -12 peaches.

In the previous response, I made an error.  To correctly determine the number of peaches that Jill has compared to Jake, we should first understand that Steven has 4 peaches and that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill.
