First let's find out how many more bottle caps he found compared to wrappers. 71 (bottle caps) - 24 (wrappers) = 47 more bottle caps. To determine how many more bottle caps he has overall, we need to add those extra bottle caps to what he already had: 28 + 47 = 75 more bottle caps than wrappers. However, this isn't actually an accurate representation of our question since it asks us to compare bottle caps to wrappers not just the difference between them. To correct this, let's calculate how many total bottle caps and wrappers Danny has. 71 bottle caps + 28 bottle caps = 99 bottle caps. 24 wrappers + 16 wrappers = 40 wrappers. We now know he has 99 bottle caps and 40 wrappers. We can now subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps to get 99 - 40 = 59 more bottle caps than wrappers.
