Baker ended up having 139 + 8 = 147 cakes. But then he sold 145 cakes. That means he had 147 - 145 cakes left. 147 - 145 is 2. However, this isn't correct because we know that initially, the baker also had more than just those 8 initial cakes. Let's try another approach. He had x cakes to start. Then he bought 139 more cakes. So in total, he had x + 139 cakes. Then he sold 145 cakes. This means he had (x + 139) - 145 cakes left. We can set this equation equal to 2 and solve for x. We get x - 6 = 2, which is solved as follows: Add 6 to both sides of the equation. This gives us x = 8. However, since the baker still had other cakes, let's continue. We see that if he only had those 8 initial cakes, he would not be able to sell any because there wouldn't be enough.

Therefore he had a total of 8 + 139 = 147 cakes after buying. Since he sold 145, it implies he didn't buy all the cakes at one go, or he had some remaining. However, what this tells us is that he actually bought and sold 147 - 8 = 139 + 8 (initials) - 6. However, this doesn't make sense. It tells us that he bought 139 and sold 145, but he has 8 less than 147. 139 + 8 is 147, which is what he had after buying. And 139 - 6 is 133, which is not equal to 8. We need to re-examine our steps. The total number of cakes available to him was 147. Out of these, 145 were sold, which leaves us with 147 - 145 cakes remaining. This equals 2.

Let's figure out how many he had before the sale. He had 2 cakes left. To get 2 cakes, you would take away 145 cakes from 8 + 139 = 147 cakes. This means we need to find how many cakes he had in stock when he had 139 + 8 - x = 145 cakes. Where 'x' represents the cakes he already had initially. The equation can also be written as 139 + 8 - x = 145 => 147 - x = 145 => -x = -2 => x = 2. So he had 2 cakes when he started the whole process, therefore, he must have bought and sold 147 cakes.
