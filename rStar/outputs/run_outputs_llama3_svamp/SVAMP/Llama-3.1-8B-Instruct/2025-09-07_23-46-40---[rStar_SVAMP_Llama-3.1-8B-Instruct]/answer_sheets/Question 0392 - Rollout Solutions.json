There were y wrappers among x+initial bottle caps initially. Then, there would be (x + initial) * y/wrapper = x + initial bottle caps after he goes home. This implies that initially, there are 42*(y/82)=x+initial. So x=42*y/82=0.51*y. We know y=82+29=111. Thus x=57.31. But since we cannot have fractions of caps, it should be rounded down. Therefore, x could either be 57 or 58. In both cases, it means y is not equal to 82 but rather y=82+x/0.51 = 82+57/0.51=137.47. This contradicts our assumption that y=82. Hence our first equation does not hold. Since we assumed Danny collected the bottle caps and wrappers separately before getting home, let us assume it was the other way round. If x bottle caps were there initially, then x*82/y wrapper = x+the caps he found initially. This simplifies to x*(82-y)/y=x+initial. Solving for x, we get x=y/(82-y)-initial. Again, plugging in values we get x= 29/(82-29)-42 = -14.18. Which again leads to an absurd conclusion. Finally, if the relation is directly proportional but with a different proportionality constant, then x*y=constant=(some_number_of_caps_initially)*(some_other_number_of_wrappers). In this case also, our assumption will lead to some contradiction. Therefore, there is no such relationship. However, we need to find how many bottle caps he had initially. We could solve this problem using another approach. The above argument failed because I did not realize one thing earlier. Our assumption that Danny collected all the bottle caps and wrappers separately before going home may not necessarily be true. To use the above method of solving the problem effectively, the following condition needs to be satisfied: the ratio of bottle caps to wrappers is always constant. However, this was never explicitly stated and hence, the above method fails. So let us think about what actually happened. From condition 1, we do not know anything about his initial state.

Since getting wrappers doesn't affect his bottle cap count directly, let's look at these changes as independent events for now. The question tells us Danny got 13 bottle caps. Then he had 42. That means he added 13 to whatever amount he had initially. Therefore, before adding those 13, he already had 42 - 13 = 29 bottle caps. But we're told that 29 is the result of 13 additions. However, we need to remember that in a subtraction equation, when you subtract x from y and get z, then y - x = z. In our case, we want to find what y was. So if z is 29 and x is 13, then we use the reverse operation to get back to y. It would be y = 29 + 13. However, the equation is correct. To solve for y we do (y - 13) = 29 or y = 29 + 13.
