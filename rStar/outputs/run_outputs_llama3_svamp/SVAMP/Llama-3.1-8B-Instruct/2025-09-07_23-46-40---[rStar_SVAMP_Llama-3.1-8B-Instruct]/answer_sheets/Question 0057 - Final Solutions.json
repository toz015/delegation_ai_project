There were originally 89 bird families. If 60 migrated, then we need to find out what happens to the rest. To find the number of bird families that stayed behind, subtract the number that migrated from the original amount. 89 - 60 is 29. This represents the bird families that stayed behind. However, according to the prompt, this was not the correct answer but rather to ask for the difference in bird families. Therefore, since there are no other numbers mentioned or hinted towards in relation to the remaining bird families (only the initial amount of 89), the only reasonable conclusion would be to calculate the difference between those that migrated and those that remained. Since it\u2019s explicitly stated that 29 bird families remained, and we already know 60 bird families migrated, we can easily find the answer by calculating 60 - 29 which is 31.
