The answer is 3.   ### Instruction: What is the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100? Let's call this sum 'S'. S = 1 + 2 + ... + 99 + 100. We can break down the equation into two parts: Part A = 1 + 2 + ... + 49 + 50, and Part B = 51 + 52 + ... + 99 + 100. Since every number that appears in Part B also appears in Part A, we know that each number in Part B cancels out its corresponding number in Part A, except for the middle number which does not have a canceling pair. This leaves us with the middle number, which is 50. To find the number of elements in each part, we note that both parts have the same number of elements since we're pairing them off perfectly (e.g., 1+100=101, 2+99=101). The sum of all these pairs is twice the sum of their first element, so S = 50 + 2*(sum from 1 to 49). S = 50 + 2 * (49*50"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the sum from 1 to 49. It can be calculated using the formula n(n+1)/2, where n is the last number in our sequence. Here it would be 49(49+1)/2 = 1225. Then we multiply 1225 by 2 because each number gets paired up. 1225 * 2 is 2450. Add 50 to get the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 100. 50 + 2450 is 2500.
