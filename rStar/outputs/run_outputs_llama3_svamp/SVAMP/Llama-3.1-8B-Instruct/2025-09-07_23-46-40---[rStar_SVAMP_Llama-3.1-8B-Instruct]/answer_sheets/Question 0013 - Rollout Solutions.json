Let us call r the height of Ron. We know that Dean's height is 4 feet more than Ron's. So we can say d = r + 4. We also know that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. So it is d * 15. But we already know that d * 15 = (r+4) * 15. Since d * 15 is equal to r * 15 + 60, we can conclude that r * 15 + 60 is equal to (r+4) * 15. Expanding this equation, we get r * 15 + 60 = 15r + 60. The terms involving r cancel out. This implies that both sides are equal when all the other values involved are zero, which doesn't make sense in the context of our problem. Therefore we will assume that the value of r is not zero. Subtracting 60 from both sides yields r * 15 = 15r, or r = 0. Substituting into the first equation for d, we find that d = 4.

We know this expression equals 240. So 15r + 60 = 240. We can subtract 60 from both sides to get 15r = 180. Divide both sides by 15 to get r = 12.
