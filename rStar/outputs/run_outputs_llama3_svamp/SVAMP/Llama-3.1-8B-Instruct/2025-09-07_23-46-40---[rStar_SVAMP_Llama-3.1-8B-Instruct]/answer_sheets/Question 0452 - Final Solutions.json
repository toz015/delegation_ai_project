This means 8 - 5 = 3 initial customers left. However, since we know he is now dealing with 104 people, those 99 new arrivals plus the original 5 must be 104, meaning no one left among the originals - or it would not make sense to say only 5 were there earlier. My reasoning must have been faulty. The problem statement actually says he dealt with 'five customers' at some point; implying they stayed. Then, if he had 5 when he got 99, then he indeed had 5 before getting the 99. Hence, all 8 of the original customers must still have been present when he got those 99. But if the number of new customers is not relevant to determining how many stayed of the 8, that means we don't need to use it at all. The answer is 3.

Thus we know that there must be a specific mix of new and old in the room but since we are told they just got 99 new and this is all the new, none of our eight people who started out originally left their seats when we first meet, implying zero left initially, leaving us with a math error or flawed reasoning based upon what the question states as fact. This would normally mean you could stop here. However, if it truly means 99 new plus 5 = 104 total meaning that all 99 are new then that means your original eight, minus five, equalled three left originally, because you've added 99 new customers making the equation work.
