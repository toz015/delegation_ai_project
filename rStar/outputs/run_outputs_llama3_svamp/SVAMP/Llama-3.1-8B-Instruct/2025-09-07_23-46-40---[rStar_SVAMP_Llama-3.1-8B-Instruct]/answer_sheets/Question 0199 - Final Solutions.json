First, let's calculate the daily usage of soda bottles. 9 soda bottles per day is used daily. Debby has 360 soda bottles. We need to divide the number of bottles (360) by the usage (9). This is called division and it means how many groups of something fit into another thing. 360 \u00f7 9 = 40. So the soda bottles will last for 40 days. The answer is: 40.  The water bottles will also last but we don't need to know that since we're only solving for the soda bottles. \n\nNote: These problem sets are generated based on a simple set of logic puzzles designed for students.
