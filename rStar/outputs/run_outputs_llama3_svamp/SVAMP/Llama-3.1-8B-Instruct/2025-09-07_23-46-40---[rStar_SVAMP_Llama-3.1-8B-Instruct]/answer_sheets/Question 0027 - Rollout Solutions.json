This means that 13 crackers are divided among 28 people which is 13/28, but since crackers are divided equally, they would be cut into 28 parts (making it 1/28 per piece) and therefore we should calculate 13 divided by 28 because the initial pieces are not fractions of crackers but whole ones. Similarly, cakes are also divided among 28 people and 15 cakes are divided into 28 parts (making it 1/28 or cutting it into 28 parts if they're considered fractional). Each person gets (13/28) crackers and (15/28) cakes. However, since we are asked about total items given out rather than the ratio, we know from initial conditions that 13 is total crackers, 15 is total cakes, and he distributed equally among 28 people.

We know there will be 13/28 crackers per person and 15/28 cakes per person. To find out how many actual cracker and cake units per person will exist when evenly divided we need to multiply each value by the same number of times, 28: 13 * 28 = 364 and 15 * 28 = 420. With these values in hand you divide both by 28 again to figure what each one will receive (since they share an identical number of portions given the even split): 13/28 cracker pieces are 13, so simply multiply the number of people by this rate to find out the total number of pieces shared out of 28. Then do the same thing with the other food item. This means 28 people sharing 13 crackers each would equal 13*28 =364 cracker pieces. And 28 sharing 15 cakes each yields 15*28= 420 cake pieces. We divide each by the total number of shares to get how many of each type each individual got. The result for both 364/28 and 420/28 comes out as 13. So each person ate 13 crackers and 15 cakes.
