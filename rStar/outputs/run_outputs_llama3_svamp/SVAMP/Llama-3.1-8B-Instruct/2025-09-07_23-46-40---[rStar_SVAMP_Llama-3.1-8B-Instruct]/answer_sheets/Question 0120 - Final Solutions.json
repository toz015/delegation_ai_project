Let the unknown number of reading pages be r. From condition 2, we know 7 (math) = r (reading) + 4. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 7 - 4 = r. This means 3 = r. So Rachel has to do 3 pages of reading. The answer is: 3. \n\nNote: This is not following the exact problem format but rather a proof-style problem.
