Since there is no other information about biology homework, this is all we can get from the problem. Hint 2: This question was tricky because it only asked for reading and biology homework but provided a piece of information about biology homework instead of reading homework. It seems like a trick question. However, looking back at the previous sentence, it says 'biology homework'. Not 'reading' or 'other subjects.' We should ignore any other part of the statement and just read what it says. Rachel had to complete 6 more pages of biology homework. That's the answer to the first half of the prompt. The second half of the prompt asks how many pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete. Looking again at the original prompt, it mentions that Rachel had to complete 10 pages of reading homework. That's what we needed to know. So the prompt is asking us to find the sum of these two numbers. We already found out what those numbers are. They are 6 (for biology) and 10 (for reading).
