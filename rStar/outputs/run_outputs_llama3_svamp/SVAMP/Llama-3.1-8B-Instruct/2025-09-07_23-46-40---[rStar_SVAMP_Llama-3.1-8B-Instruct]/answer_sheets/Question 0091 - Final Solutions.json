Question 6.1: Now we can answer the question: How many cookies did she give to her sister? Answer 6.1: Sally started with 250 cookies. She gave her sister 50% of these. This can be calculated by multiplying 250 by 0.5 (which is equivalent to finding 50%). Thus, she gave her sister 250 x 0.5 = 125 cookies. The answer is 125. The final answer is: $\\boxed{125}$ Question 7: A group of friends went to see a movie. Each friend brought one bag of popcorn. They bought 12 bags of popcorn. If they ate one-third of a bag per person, how many people were there? Question 7.1: How many bags of popcorn did the group of friends bring? Answer 7.1: The group bought 12 bags of popcorn. Since they already had some bags, we assume that the 12 bags purchased were in addition to what they brought. However, without information about additional bags brought, we will focus solely on the 12 purchased bags. The answer is 12. Question 7.2: Now we can answer the question: How many people were there? Answer 7.2: If the group bought 12 bags of popcorn, and every person ate one bag, then we cannot determine the exact number of people since we do not know if anyone else had bags. However, let us consider another scenario where they all used the purchased bags, so there were 12 people. If that is the case, the answer is 12. Note: There may be other solutions depending on the situation, but based on the provided information, 12 people could be a possible solution.
