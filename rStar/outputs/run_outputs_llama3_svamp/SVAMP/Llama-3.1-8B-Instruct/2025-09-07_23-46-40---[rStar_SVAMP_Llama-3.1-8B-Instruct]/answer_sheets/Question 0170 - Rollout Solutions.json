To do so, we can use information from condition 2 and 3 to set up an equation. Let X represent the original number of kids. From condition 2, we know the number of kids who went to the camp is 893835. Since there were 78 kids from outside the county attending the camp as well, we can say that the rest of the kids at the camp came from Lawrence county. Therefore, the number of kids going to the camp from Lawrence county would be 893835 - 78 = 893757. This is equal to the original number of kids minus the kids staying home in Lawrence county. That means X - 644997 = 893757. Now let's solve this equation. First add 644997 to both sides: X = 893757 + 644997. The result is 1538754. So the original population was 1538754.
