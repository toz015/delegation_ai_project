Since we don't know what she initially gave, let's assume this value as 'X'. We can write: X - (cost of cookie + cost of cake) = 56. Let's first calculate the cost of goods sold. If she buys 1 pack of cookie, that costs 1 dollar. If she buys 1 pack of cake, that costs 1 dollar too. 2 packs of cookies would be 2 dollars, 12 packs of cakes would be 12 dollars. Thus, the equation becomes X - 2 - 12 = 56. This implies X = 70. This X is the initial amount. Therefore, Lucy paid 70 - 56 = 14 dollars. Which is the cost of items purchased.

Let's assume Lucy spent x dollars. When Lucy returned home, she had 56 dollars in change. Since change is what you receive when you pay with a larger denomination than the price required, if you paid with y dollars, your change would be y - (price) = change. Since Lucy received 56 dollars as change, this means she must have paid x dollars initially and she had $y dollars total. Thus, y - x = 56. Since we also know she paid x dollars, it follows that y = x + 56. Thus, y - (price) = x + 56 - (price) = change. Since Lucy paid y dollars, the equation can be reduced to: y - (price) = 56. The problem states that she bought 14 packs. So the total price of these packs must equal y - 56. To find out how many packs of groceries Lucy bought in total, we must first find out the total price of her groceries. Because Lucy bought 14 packs, each costing 1 dollar, so the total cost is 14.
