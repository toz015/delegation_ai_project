In algebraic terms the initial amount could be considered as being represented by a variable such as 'x', an addition (or subtraction) operation as indicated in the word problem may be viewed as the solution to another algebraic equation, and finally determining the resulting amount afterwards", "value": 0.875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "For the walls of the house he would use 4 nails in all to secure large planks of wood.
