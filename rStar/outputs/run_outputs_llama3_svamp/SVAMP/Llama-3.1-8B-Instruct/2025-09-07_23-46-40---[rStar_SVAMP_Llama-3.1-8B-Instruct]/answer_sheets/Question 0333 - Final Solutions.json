Alternatively, considering the corrected approach above and focusing strictly on determining the number of roses cut directly following the correction noted in Question 5.1, the actual task involves identifying the difference between the final state (23 roses) and the corrected state before additional rose cutting (considering a revised scenario with correct information), which indicates the number of roses Jessica added after throwing some away, not the roses she cut. To find out the number of roses cut, we actually need to go back one step from the final state (adding new roses in a way that matches the initial misinterpretation but now accounting for accurate context): First, consider the corrected addition of 7 roses followed by the removal of 4.
