Since this is not what we want, let's see how much more sugar is needed than actually used. First find out how much sugar she doesn't need, which is 62 - 5 = 57. Therefore she doesn't need 57 cups of sugar. To find the actual amount of sugar needed, we know that only 5 - 62 = -57 cups of sugar should be subtracted but since you can't have negative cups of sugar, we change it to -(-57) which becomes 57. However since she needs less than what she currently has, the extra amount she currently has is simply equal to 57. Now to calculate how much sugar is actually needed, we need to take away the extra sugar from the desired amount. This means 5 - 57. Therefore, she actually needs -52 cups of sugar which is mathematically impossible so if we assume she has enough for 5 cups of sugar in total and that she has used all of it, then that would mean she needs 0 cups of sugar.

(In other words, if she had some flour leftover after finishing the baking, she will just use the flour she has and forget about the 9 cups requirement. If she adds any more than that, she will end up with leftover flour and she probably won't be able to fit in the fridge. And who knows maybe she already finished baking and she has leftover flour from previous bakes because then she could use that leftover flour but in this scenario I'm assuming that the recipe requires 9 cups of flour and that's all she needs.)
