However, you can't visit half a time so we just consider whole days here. They also asked about 25 days. We can just multiply the daily average by 25. We know the average is 474.5 so 474.5 x 25 = 11862.5. Since you can't visit half a time, and we're not considering the actual times but rather just the number of visits over these periods, 473.75 can be rounded down to 25 days because it wouldn't be possible to reach 474.5 on 24th day if it is a full count. \n\nThus the correct approach would be adding the data given directly as it is and calculating total number over the period which leads us to: \nYesterday was 703 people and today was 246.

That gives 703 people/day * 25 days = 17,575 people. But to calculate what number represents the total number of people who visited the Buckingham palace, we first need to know how many times 703 occurs, because those days had 703 people and how many times 246 occurs (because these are the people who visit other days) so, that we could add them together in order to make sense of the problem. To do that, let's break down the problem to its most basic form. From day one to 25, that means we're counting 25 days. Let's say, all 25 days had 703 people visiting. We would simply multiply the daily count of 703 by the number of days (25). 703 * 25 is 17675. Then, to figure out how many of the days had 246 people visiting, we take a look at the difference between the original total of 17675, and the new total of 17575 (the total calculated using the method mentioned above). By subtracting these numbers, we would get 100, which indicates 10 days that occurred with 246 people visiting instead of 703. Therefore, if there were 246 visitors on that day, the actual number representing the total number of people who visited the Buckingham palace is indeed 17575.

That gives 703 people/day * 25 days = 17,575 people. However, since that's not entirely correct, let's rephrase our initial problem. If there were 246 visitors on that day, and 703 people on every other day, we should calculate how often 703 happened, and how often 246 happened. Since we know 703 appeared 15 times, and 246 appeared once, we can now solve the equation by multiplying 703 times 15, and adding the product of 246 times one, thus arriving at the conclusion that 17575 is the correct answer.

The problem doesn't make sense because it gives information about the visit counts of different days but asks for the visit count over 25 days without telling us what day we're counting from or to. However, based on the assumption that we are counting from the previous day of 703 visitors, so the previous day of 246 visitors (which I guess might be the day before of 703), let's say this. If we count every day, the first day would have 703 visitors, the second day would have 246 visitors. Since both the day before 703 and 246 can be treated as the initial point, it is reasonable to assume either one as our starting day. If we start from 703, then after 24 days, which would be at 246, adding these numbers up gives us 703 + 246 x 24. This equals to 703 + 5880 = 6583.
