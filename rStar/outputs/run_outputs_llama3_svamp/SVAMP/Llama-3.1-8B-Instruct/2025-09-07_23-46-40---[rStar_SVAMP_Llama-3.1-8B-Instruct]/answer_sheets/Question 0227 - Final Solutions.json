There are a total of 5 items per friend, so each friend got 5 / 2 = 2.5 crackers and cakes respectively.

Let's call the number of crackers each friend gets 'x', then the number of cakes each friend gets is also 'x'. Then 7*x = 14 (for crackers) and 7*x = 21 (for cakes). This shows that our initial assumption of distributing an equal number of each item doesn't work. Instead, let's think about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 21, which is 7, and see how many groups of 7 crackers and 3 cakes could fit within these totals. To do that, we need to calculate how many groups of 7 crackers and 3 cakes could be made, but since it can only be whole numbers, and 7 goes into 14 exactly twice, but 3 goes into 21 only 7 times, the problem really requires us to take 14 / 7 and 21 / 3 = 7, but there are not enough sets of 3 cakes to give out 7 items to each person using these values, so what actually happens when dividing all 35 items evenly between 7 people would require doing (14+21)/7=7, but only getting (14/7)=2 crackers, and (21/7)=3 cakes.
