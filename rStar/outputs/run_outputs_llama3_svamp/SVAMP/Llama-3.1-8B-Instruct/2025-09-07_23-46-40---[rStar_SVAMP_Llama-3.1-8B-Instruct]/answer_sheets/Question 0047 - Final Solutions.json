If you remove 10 figures from the 7, you would have 7 - 10 = -3 which doesn't make sense. Since we know that you can't have negative action figures, the correct statement should be that 7 figures must be less than the number of figures that were removed because 7 could not be the same as or greater than the number of figures that were removed. Thus, let's reword this problem: Let y represent the number of action figures that Jerry added to the shelf. He already had 7 action figures on the shelf. He then removed 10 of those. But since you can't have a negative number of figures, he must have had more than 7 that was removed. Thus, y > 7 - 10. Therefore, y > -3. So there are 8 figures total.

However, since the problem is structured as \"How many action figures did Jerry add to the shelf?\", we can say that the total number of action figures present when he removed 10 was 8, hence before removal, there were 18.
