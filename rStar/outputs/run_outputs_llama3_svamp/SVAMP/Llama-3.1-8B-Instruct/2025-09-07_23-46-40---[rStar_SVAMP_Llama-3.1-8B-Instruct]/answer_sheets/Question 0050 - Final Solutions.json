Since we don't know exactly how many alligators are hiding, we cannot assume anything about them.

This means we need to subtract the unknown number of hiding alligators (not the actual number, but rather the potential difference in alligator visibility) from the original amount of alligators to determine the number of visible alligators. Since we already know that 93 snakes are present, we could set up an equation using the fact that there are only snakes and visible alligators as known quantities in this situation: Let 'n' be the # of non-visible alligators. We would then have (visible alligators) + (known snakes) + (hidden alligators) = initial alligators. (visible alligators) + 93 + n = 97. To solve for visible alligators, we get visible alligators = 97 - n + 93 - 93 = 97 - n, but we also get visible alligators = 97 - n; however we can easily re-arrange this so that it becomes clear: visible alligators + hidden alligators +", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 7}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
