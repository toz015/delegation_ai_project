Let's add those together. 6 + 16 is 22. We also know that he ended up with 19 dollars. This means he spent 22 dollars (the cost of all the things) which was made from the original amount. To get that, let's use the equation: Original Amount - Total Spent = Final Amount. We already know what these values are. Total Spent = 22, Final Amount = 19. Now we can plug them into our equation.
