But let's follow through anyway! Let's think step by step. According to condition 1, Marco and his dad together picked 35 pounds of strawberries. Condition 2 says Marco's portion weighed 13 pounds. To find out how many pounds Marco's dad picked, we need to subtract 13 from 35. This leaves us with Marco's dads portion which is 35 - 13 = 22 pounds. Since the question asks for the weight difference, we need to compare Marco's portion to his dad's portion. This weight difference would be Marco's dad's portion minus Marco's portion. So it is 22 - 13 = 9. However the problem statement asked to follow the instruction to provide the solution in specific format so I'll correct that here by following instructions.
