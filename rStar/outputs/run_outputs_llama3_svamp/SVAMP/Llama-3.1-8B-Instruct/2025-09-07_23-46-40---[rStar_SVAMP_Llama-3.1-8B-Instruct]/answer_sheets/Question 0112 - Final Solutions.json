We know there were 13 roses and 7 orchids in the vase after she cut flowers. That means that 7 orchids and 13 roses were added to the vase. Since there were originally 16 roses and 3 orchids, you can determine what was added. To find out how many flowers she cut, let's first add all of the original flowers together. 16 + 3 = 19. Then, subtract the amount of flowers in the vase now from that number. 19 - 20 is not correct because it would say she added instead of took away flowers. 20 is the wrong answer since it shows addition. We need the opposite so that is why 19 - 20 is incorrect.  Let's try the other way around. If there are 13 roses and 7 orchids, and there were 16 and 3 before cutting flowers, then we take 13 - 16 which equals -3 (meaning there are three less) for roses and 7 - 3 for orchids.
