But, given the provided data is somewhat misleading and requires strict interpretation without further assumptions, let's resolve the misunderstanding based strictly on what's been provided: If we correctly identify that she ended up with $49, indicating her actual use (including ATM withdrawals and other expenses) totals $46 when subtracting the $3 from her starting point (since she went from having $3 to $49 after the supermarket transaction), and realizing that the ATM withdrawals should account for covering these expenses and her starting balance, then the question essentially seeks the difference between her ATM collection and the final sum of her spending, which equals her $3 initial, not the full ATM amount since her actual usage after initial funds amounts to the ATM withdrawal value minus her pre-ATM withdrawal state. This makes the ATM withdrawal directly related to covering her supermarket expenses plus the initial $3. Thus, by calculating the ATM amount needed to cover both her supermarket purchases and her initial $3, which is $49 - $3 (initial cash), this results in $46 (final amount after supermarket spend). The actual question asks about the amount she received from the ATM minus her supermarket spend. As initially stated, if we consider all her financial activity post-$3 (excluding the ATM money being explicitly used for everything, acknowledging the statement about ATM money exceeding the supermarket spend might be misinterpreted), we'd focus on determining her ATM funds' contribution toward reaching her post-supermarket spend balance. Reconsidering, to clarify: We know she starts with $3, collects $49 from the ATM, and ends up with $49 after shopping. Her spend includes both her ATM withdrawal and her $3. Considering her ATM contribution toward her supermarket spend plus her $3, if we look at her ATM contribution alone for exceeding her supermarket spend, it boils down to understanding her ATM funds as being necessary to cover both her supermarket spend and the $3. In actuality, Olivia spent her entire ATM withdrawal on her supermarket trip including covering her initial $3.
