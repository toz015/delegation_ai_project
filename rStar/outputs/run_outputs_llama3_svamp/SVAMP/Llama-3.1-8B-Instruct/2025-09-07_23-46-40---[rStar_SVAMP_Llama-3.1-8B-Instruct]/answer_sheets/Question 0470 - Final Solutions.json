Let x represent the number of marbles Doug starts out with. Since Ed has 2 more than Doug, Ed can be represented as x+2. Now let's assume Doug lost y marbles. That means Doug ends up having (x-y) marbles. But we also know that Ed always has 2 more marbles than Doug. That means the equation is x+2=x-y. To solve this, we isolate y by adding y to both sides and subtracting x from both sides. This leaves us with 2=y.
