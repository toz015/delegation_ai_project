Let's first find out how long it worked today. 44 shirts / 3 shirts per minute = 14.7 minutes. But this is not what we need. We know the machine works for a certain amount of time making 3 shirts per minute. In one hour, it makes 60 minutes worth of 3 shirts/minute, which is 3 x 60 = 180 shirts. This would mean it could make 53 / 180 of a shirt every minute or 0.296. However this doesn't tell us anything about yesterday so let's try another way. We already know it worked 14.67 minutes to make 44 shirts, but since we don't know if it takes the same amount of time to make the other 9 (or even if the time is consistent), let's go back and use the fact that it made 53 shirts in total over the 2 days. So it took x minutes to make 9 shirts. Since it can make 3 shirts per minute, the number of minutes it took to make the 9 shirts is 9/3 = 3. Therefore, it was working for 3 minutes yesterday.

First we know the machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 44 shirts today. We also know that it can make 3 shirts per minute.

Yesterday the machine made 9 shirts and worked 14 minutes today. Since we know 3 shirts per minute, we can say the machine works at a rate of 3 shirts/minute. Let's call the time the machine worked yesterday as X hours. Since the question asked about the machine working in minutes, not hours, we will keep our result in terms of Y minutes. We need to convert the time the machine was active in hours, so it becomes 1 hour = 60 minutes, or, 3 hours = 180 minutes.

However, this doesn't seem right since you cannot divide something into an integer number of parts like this if you know what I mean. Let me try again. We know the machine works at a rate of 3 shirts per minute, let's call the unknown time t. Then 3t=9 (because it made 9 shirts) and t=9/3=3. This seems suspicious. Wait, perhaps I've made another mistake? Ah, the issue here is not the math itself, but rather my interpretation of it. Let's rephrase our problem slightly. Yesterday, it made 9 shirts. Today, it made 44 shirts. Thus, since 44 shirts is 15 shirts more than 29 shirts (i.e., 3x5), then yesterday it had to be 3 times some amount x, such that when multiplied by 5, it would equal 29. And when subtracted from 9, the resulting difference should also be divisible by 3. The reason is that, just as 44/3 has remainder 2, 9/x has remainder 0 when divided by 3, meaning x must be divisible by 3. Thus, we set up our equation as follows: x * 5 = 29 and (9-x)/3 = 0 (the first equation makes no sense). In order to meet both conditions simultaneously, x must equal 5.7. But we already see why this solution will fail later in the course of the explanation. If our answer isn't divisible by 3, then the last statement we wrote is false. We can find the value of x as follows. First, we note that both equations must be met simultaneously. To get the number of shirts we need in order to find x, we take 9 shirts and change it to a multiple of 3 using simple subtraction. Thus, we get 9 shirts = (6+3)=6 shirts + 3 shirts. In addition to the 3 shirts, the machine made 44 shirts. So we can determine the total number of shirts it made by adding 6 shirts and 3 shirts. In other words, we're trying to solve the following equation: 3 shirts + 3 shirts + 6 shirts + x shirts = 44 shirts.
