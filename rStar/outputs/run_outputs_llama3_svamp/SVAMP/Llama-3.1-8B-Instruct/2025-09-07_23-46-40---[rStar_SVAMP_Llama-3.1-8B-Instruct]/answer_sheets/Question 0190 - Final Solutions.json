That means he sold 78 cakes out of 43 original ones (so we can ignore this part) but 154 out of 114 pastries. Let's focus on the latter as we're comparing pastries to cakes. First we find out how many pastries were not sold. This would be 114 - 154 = -40 pastries. However, because you cannot have negative numbers (we don't know what that would mean), it implies that baker didn't actually make so many pastries or people stole them from him. But we'll assume everything is fine. We want the difference between pastries and cakes. 154 (pastries) - 78 (cakes) = 76.

Since you cannot sell a negative amount of items, this is incorrect and we reevaluate the question as it seems flawed.
