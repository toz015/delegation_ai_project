Since the question only tells us about what happened with the bottle caps, let's consider it separately. We know that he also had 17 original bottle caps. However, this information might not directly help, as we want to know how many wrappers he had. Let's continue our thought process. \n\nWe know Danny ended up with 57 wrappers. 30 of those came from the park. Therefore, to figure out how many wrappers Danny already had before going to the park, we can simply take away the amount of wrappers he got from the park.
