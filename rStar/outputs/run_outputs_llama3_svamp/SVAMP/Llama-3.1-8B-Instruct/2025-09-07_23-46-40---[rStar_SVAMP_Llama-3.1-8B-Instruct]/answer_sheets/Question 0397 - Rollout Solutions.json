First, we know that Dave used 8 tickets to buy toys. To find out how many tickets he used for clothes, we need to know how many tickets he had left before buying clothes. We can find this out by subtracting the number of tickets he used to buy toys (8) from the original amount of tickets he had (13). So he had 13 - 8 = 5 tickets left. But he used 18 tickets to buy clothes. Since you don't use the remaining tickets but rather the ones used, the question asks how many tickets were used for clothes versus the number used for toys which was 8.
