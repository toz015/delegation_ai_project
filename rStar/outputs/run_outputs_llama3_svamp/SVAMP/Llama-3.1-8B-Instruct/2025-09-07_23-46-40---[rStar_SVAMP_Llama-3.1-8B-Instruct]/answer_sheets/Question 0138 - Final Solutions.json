This means Matthew has 18 pairs to divide among 4 friends, which results in 18 / 4 = 4.5 pairs per friend. However, you cannot divide a pair into fractions. As such, Matthew would actually only be able to give out 4 full pairs (16 items), but since he has 18 pairs in total, he ends up having some extra items. He had 10 crackers and 8 cakes, meaning he has 2 crackers and 2 cakes left over when dividing equally among friends. He has 2 crackers leftover which he can't match with cakes so all 4 friends get 4 crackers. However, he still wants to give out equal amounts. He has 2 cakes, so they have to go to either one person or split it between 2 people who already got some. This changes the scenario slightly as now we see that we're trying to find out how many cakes each of the 4 gets if we consider the leftovers. Each friend gets a pair of crackers which is 4 in total. But let's say they each get some cakes. If they get an equal share of cakes then each friend gets 2 cakes. Which brings us back to our problem. We know that Matthew has to give out 4 items of each type in total, and each friend gets 2 crackers so far. Now the question isn\u2019t what\u2019s the minimum number of cakes he could give them but rather how many cakes each receives in general given that Matthew has 8 cakes to begin with. In other words what percent of the total possible distribution does each person get. Let's look again at the problem. With the information given in condition 2 that Matthew gives equal numbers of both items to his 4 friends and considering he only has 8 cakes he could give out 8 / 4 = 2 cakes to each friend while also matching each friend with 2 crackers if desired. The question doesn\u2019t state anything about the number of crackers Matthew has being relevant to solving for how many cakes each friend gets so we should disregard the number of crackers altogether because as long as each friend gets an equal number of cakes (the limiting factor here) they each end up getting 2.
