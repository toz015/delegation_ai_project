We can break down the equation into two parts: Part A = 1 + 2 + ... + 49 + 50, and Part B = 51 + 52 + ... + 99 + 100. Since every number that appears in Part B also appears in Part A, we know that each number in Part B cancels out its corresponding number in Part A, except for the middle number which does not have a canceling pair. This leaves us with the middle number, which is 50. To find the number of elements in each part, we note that both parts have the same number of elements since we're pairing them off perfectly (e.g., 1+100=101, 2+99=101). The sum of all these pairs is twice the sum of their first element, so S = 50 + 2*(sum from 1 to 49).
