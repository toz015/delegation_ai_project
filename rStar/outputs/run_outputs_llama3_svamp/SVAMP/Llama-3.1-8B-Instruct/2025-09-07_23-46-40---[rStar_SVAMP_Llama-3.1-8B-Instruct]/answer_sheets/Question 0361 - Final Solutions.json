We know that there are four seats on the Ferris wheel. And if 16 people can ride it, that means 4 seats * x people = 16 people. We need to find out what value of x makes this true. To solve the problem, we divide both sides of the equation (4*x) = 16 by 4. This leaves us with x = 16/4. If we simplify the right-hand side of this equation, we get x = 4.
