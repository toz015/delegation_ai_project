However, he also found some more. To get an idea of the number of bottle caps and wrappers he still needs to add, let\u2019s calculate how many bottle caps and wrappers he has now: 37 (bottle caps) and 86 (wrappers). We can now subtract these values from the initial numbers of bottle caps and wrappers to see what he has found since then. The difference between 37 and 30 is 7, and the difference between 86 and 14 is 72. The question is not asking us how many bottle caps or how many wrappers he has, but rather how many more bottle caps than wrappers he has found. The answer to this is 7 - 72, however since you cannot subtract a larger value from a smaller value, we do need to look at the problem from another angle. There must be something wrong with our calculation, if we don\u2019t use a simpler solution for the question. Let\u2019s take a different approach: At home, he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers. He got 14 wrappers at the park. This would mean that he has already 86 - 14 = 72 wrappers when he went to the park. He found 30 bottle caps at the park. Therefore, at home he has 7 + 30 = 37 bottle caps. We know he had 30 bottle caps at the park. The difference is therefore simply 37 - 30, which is indeed 7. But this is the answer of how many bottlecaps he actually has, and not how many he found. This will make sense once we continue on the following line of reasoning. From this point onwards we need to think about what the question is really asking. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did he find? To solve this, we need to see what percentage of wrappers is equal to the number of bottle caps he found. And then see how many wrappers is needed for that certain percentage of his wrappers at the park. Then we could determine how many wrappers he must have found, to end up with 14 wrappers plus the unknown number of wrappers he finds at the park. We already know that he found 30 bottle caps.

This implies he had 37 - 7 = 30 bottle caps at home, and then had 30 at the park making the difference between bottle caps found and wrappers found at the park equal to the initial query: 30 - 72. But in fact this is another way to ask what was answered above which is he found 7 fewer wrappers. To directly address the query, we need the absolute difference, therefore the correct answer is |(37 - 30) - (14 - x)| = |-1 - (-x+14)| = |-(1 + 14 - x)| = |15 - x| . From what we know, x=72. Thus, |15-x|=|-1| = 1. The answer is 1. Question 6: Two persons bought the same quantity of milk. One of them paid with $100 bill, the other one with 3 $50 bills and 10 $1 bills. How much change did the person who used 50-dollar bill get back? Question 6.1: How much money did the person who used $50 bills pay in total? Answer 6.1: The person paid with 3 $50 bills, so they paid 3 * 50 = 150 dollars. The answer is 150. Question 6.2: Now we can answer the question: How much change did the person who used $50 bills get back? Answer 6.2: Two people bought the same quantity of milk. Therefore, the person using $100 paid the same amount as the other person.
