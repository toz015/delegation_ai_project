There are 141 pots. And each pot has 71 flowers. To find out how many flowers are there in total, we need to multiply the number of flowers per pot by the total number of pots. That is, 71 x 141. Let us first calculate 71 x 100, which equals 7100. Now, let us calculate 71 x 40, which equals 2840. Adding 7100 and 2840 together equals 9940. Multiplying 71 by 1 equals 71. Now adding 9940 and 71 together equals 10011. Therefore, 71 x 141 equals 10011. However, this is not what we want to know. We want to know how many flowers there are in total. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of flowers per pot by the number of pots. This equals (71 x 100) + (71 x 40) + (71 x 1). As we already calculated before, this equals 10011.
