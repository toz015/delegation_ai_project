Since the waiter now has 107 customers, 107 - 5 = 102 must have arrived. This means the number of customers who left is not needed in order to find the total number of new arrivals. However, since the problem asks how many left, we need to calculate the number of customers who left from the initial 8. Given that we know there are 107 customers now and 5 were present previously before new customer arrival, we subtract those from the current count to find that 107 - 5 = 102 customers arrived. That leaves us having to determine the number of those initial customers, which is simply 8 (the original number), so the actual question could be answered directly with an equation, 107 - 8 = 99 (new arrivals) and 5 (already there), however, the number of existing customers initially is simply 8 since we're calculating the number of new customers arriving.
