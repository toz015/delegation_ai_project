The problem already mentions Baker initially made 99 cakes, but asks how many more cakes he bought compared to selling 89 cakes. To find out how many he bought in relation to what he sold (not the overall amount), we need to calculate how many he bought not including the initial 99. But since the question only asks about the difference between the amount he bought and the amount he sold, let's calculate this directly. He bought 167 cakes and sold 89 cakes. 167 - 89 = 78. However, this calculation was based on the interpretation that you're looking for the difference between the amounts bought and sold without considering the initial amount of 99. The correct approach would actually focus on comparing the total bought to the total sold: 168 - 99 (initial) + 167 (bought) - 89 (sold).

We know that when we add the cakes that Baker purchased (Condition 2), we get the answer to the first hint that Baker sold 89 cakes. To find out how many cakes Baker bought, let's first calculate the total amount of cakes that he had after purchasing the new ones but before selling any. We can represent it as 99 (initial) + 167 (bought). However, since he sold 89 cakes before buying any more, we have to add those back in. That leaves us with 167 + 89 which is equal to 256. But this is not the amount he initially had; it's the total before he began making any more.
