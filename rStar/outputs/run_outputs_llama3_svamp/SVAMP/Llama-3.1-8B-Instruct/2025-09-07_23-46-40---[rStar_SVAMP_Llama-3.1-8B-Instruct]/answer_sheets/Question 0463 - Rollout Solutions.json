We can also see that both people added up to 112 dollars (fred) + 3 dollars (jason) = 115 dollars, which is not equal to the sum before the delivery work. If we look closely at condition 1, we can calculate jasons total amount before working by saying the difference is 112-63=49 so that makes fred 112-49=63. However, that's still incorrect as adding these two together would make 49+63=112 which is still incorrect as it adds up to less than what was stated. What was stated was that fred added 63 dollars while jason added 60 dollars to get 112 dollars and 63 dollars respectively, when actually jason started off with 0 dollars but then took into account the 3 dollars and thus only needed to add 60, making the correct calculation for", "value": 0.9375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Last week Fred had 49 dollars and Jason had 3 dollars.
