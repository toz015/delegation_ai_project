We know that she buys 2 packages of invitations and each package has 3 invitations inside. So she gets 3 x 2 = 6 invitations from the 2 packages. Next, let's find out how many extra invitations Carol needs to buy to send out all 9 invitations. To do that, we just need to subtract the number of invitations she currently has (which is 6) from the number of invitations she needs to invite (which is 9). 6 - 9 doesn't make sense here since you can't have a negative number of invitations. It looks like I made a mistake earlier! Instead, we can simply say that Carol needs to buy enough packages to get 9 invitations. Since each package comes with 3 invitations, we can divide 9 by 3. This gives us 3. However, because we cannot buy a fraction of a package, Carol actually needs to buy 4 packages. That means she'll have 4 x 3 = 12 invitations which is more than needed so only the difference between 12 and 9 is relevant.
