Since this loss is only attributed to Marco, this means that Marco must have had 3 - 9 = -6 pounds before losing them. This isn't possible as you cannot lose less than nothing, so this is likely a trick condition. We can instead look at it like Marco's dad also lost 9 pounds. Thus, if Marco's dad had 'x' pounds initially, then after picking 24, we'd get the equation x + 3 (since he's the one who lost 9 pounds) = 24, so we solve for x: 24 - 3 = 21. However, we still need to consider the condition stating he lost 9 pounds, meaning that when he and marco first picked, their combined amount would be 9 + 21 = 30 pounds. If Marco picked 3 pounds and they collectively picked 24 pounds, this would mean Marco's dad picked 24 - 3 = 21 pounds.
