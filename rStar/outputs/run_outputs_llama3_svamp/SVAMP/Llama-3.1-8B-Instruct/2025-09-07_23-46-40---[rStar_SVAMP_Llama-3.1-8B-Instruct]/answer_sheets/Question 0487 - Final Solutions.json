Without information about this distribution (for example, if she drank the same number every day or if it varies), we can't calculate the exact daily consumption. The question lacks necessary data to calculate the answer directly. Let's provide a basic approach based on available information and assumptions. If Debby drinks the same number of bottles each day, we could divide the total by 17: 153 / 17 = 9.
