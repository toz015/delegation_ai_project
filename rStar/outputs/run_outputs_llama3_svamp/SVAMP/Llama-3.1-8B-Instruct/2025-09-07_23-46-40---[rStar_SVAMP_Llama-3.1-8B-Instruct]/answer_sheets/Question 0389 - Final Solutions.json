They lasted until only 0 remained. We can see that 312 > 200. It makes sense that they didn't last long. Because she drank more than the number she had, it will take less time. Let's say they lasted 'x' days. Then 200 / 312 = x. But because you can't divide into fractions, this isn't actually useful information here, so let's just use the hint from before that they didn't last very long and moved on to the next part of the problem: calculating the length of time that the soda lasted. Debby initially had 256 sodas. Every day she drank 4 sodas. To find out how many days the soda lasted, we need to divide the initial amount of soda by how many she drank every day. So 256 / 4 = 64.

From the total 256 soda bottles, she also drank 4 soda bottles a day. Thus, 4 soda bottles x number of days = 256 soda bottles. So number of days = 256 / 4 = 64. We found that from soda bottles' perspective, Debby drinks 312 water bottles per day for 64 days. Now we need to consider that Debby can't drink 312 water bottles a day because in reality she might be having fewer water bottles. However, from Question 5.1, we see that water bottles will last approximately 0.64 days when considering Debby drinks 312 water bottles per day. To determine how many water bottles Debby actually consumes from the perspective of soda bottles, we should use real data from Question 5.2: Debby has 0 water bottles left. Thus, she may or may not consume water bottles every day depending upon availability. However, if she had enough water bottles, it would take her about 0.64 days from the perspective of soda bottles (which is an assumption and not actual). Considering Debby will drink water bottles at least until no more water bottles exist (which takes 0 days) and then start drinking only soda bottles per day for rest of the days, Debby will last 64 days for soda bottles.
