First we determine how many files he deleted. He started with 59 files and ended up with 30 files. That means he deleted 59 - 30 = 29 files. Then to find out how many apps he deleted, we find out how many total items he deleted. We know he deleted 29 files. He also deleted (59 - 30) = 29 files. Since we have to add the deleted files and deleted apps together and know he had 15 original apps and 12 remaining, this means he deleted 15 - 12 = 3 apps. To make sure that our math is correct let us see if 29 files + 3 apps = 32 which when subtracted from the original 59 + 15 = 74 makes sense. 74 - 32 = 42 which is not what we want. We need to get back to the drawing board and reevaluate our calculations. Let's start again. Dave had 59 files. He had 30 files later. So he deleted 59 - 30 = 29 files.
