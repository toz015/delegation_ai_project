There are 79 animals total. Snakes hid and alligators hid too. We don't know if they count for an overlap because we're asked about what wasn't hidden, but in this case it doesn't matter since we still want the total amount of non-hidden animals as well as knowing if there is an overlap. However, this is irrelevant information to the problem statement asking how many were not hiding. Since the question asks for non-hiding animals in general and both snakes and alligators hid, our main goal should focus on finding the difference between the total amount of animals in the cage versus how many hid. 24 (snakes) + 51 (alligators) isn't the right way to go. Instead we should subtract the amount that hid from the total. That is 79 - 75. The reason for this choice comes from looking at it from different perspectives and doing the math from different methods. From another perspective, we could say we already know that both snakes and alligators hid (and their numbers aren't overlapping), so the real job here is to find out the non-hidden animals which indeed would be the total minus all the ones who did hide. 79 - 75 equals 4.
