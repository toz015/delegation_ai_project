Since Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, then Jill must also have 8 more peaches than Steven (not Jake) because Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. Therefore Jill has 5 + 8 = 13 peaches. To solve this problem, we need to determine how many peaches Jill has first. If Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, then Jill has 8 more peaches than Steven. However, that cannot be the case, or else Jake would have 2 + 8 = 10 peaches which is wrong. So we know that Jill has 8 more peaches than Steven cannot be true. This means our previous statements were incorrect, and we should reevaluate those statements. If Steve has 5 peaches, that is not 3 fewer than Jill. Instead, let us say Jill has x peaches. Then Jake has x - 3 peaches and Steve has x + 3 peaches. Since Steve has 5 peaches, then x + 3 = 5, therefore x equals 2. Thus Jake has 2 - 3 = -1 peaches. However, you can't have negative peaches.
