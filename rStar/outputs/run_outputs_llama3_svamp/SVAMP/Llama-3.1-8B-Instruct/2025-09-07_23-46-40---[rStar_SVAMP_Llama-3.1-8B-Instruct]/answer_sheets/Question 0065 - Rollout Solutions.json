Then it's logical to conclude that the initial count of apps should be higher because they had to reach 17 in order to get 21 files. However, since we do not know how many files were lost, we cannot know how many new apps he got. Let's try another way. 13 apps + x apps (number of new apps he got) = 24 files -> nope this doesn't work out either. Let's just say, Dave deleted 13 - 17 = -4 apps or Dave deleted 7 apps -> Nope, these calculations don't seem correct. We will calculate again using subtraction: Since he had 13 apps, then he might have had 13 + n = 17, where n is number of apps Dave has. n = 17 - 13 = 4 apps deleted.
