Let's re-examine the problem. Let's say Jason had J dollars last week. This means Fred had 114 - J dollars last week. Over the weekend, they earned 107 dollars (the difference between what they have now and last week).  So we can set up an equation: (114-J) + J = 21 + 78. We simplify this to 114 = 99.

However, we cannot proceed any further because our initial answer to Q5.1 was wrong. Let's try another approach. If Jason had x dollars last week, then Fred had 114 - x dollars. The sum of their current dollars minus their last weeks dollars equals the money they earned over the weekend. So, we can set up the following equation: (x - (114-x)) + ((114 - x) - 114) = 78 - 22. Simplifying, we get 2(x - 114) = 56. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x - 114 = 28. Adding 114 to both sides, we get x = 142. This is the correct value for the number of dollars Jason had last week. Now we can easily calculate how much money Jason made over the weekend: He made 78 - 22 = 56 dollars. However, this contradicts our previous answer. Let's go back to Q5.1 and use the correct method this time. Jason's last week's dollars plus his increase in dollars should equal his current dollars. Using algebra, we have: Jason's last week's dollars + Jason's increase in dollars = Jason's current dollars. Let's call Jason's increase in dollars Y and Jason's last week's dollars X. We know X + Y = 78. We also know that X = 142, which we found using algebra previously. However, this contradicts our work. To avoid confusion, we'll solve the equation directly. Given that Jason had X dollars last week, then he increased by Y dollars. His new total is X + Y. We know X + Y = 78. Also, Jason increased by 78 - 22 = 56 dollars. Jason had X dollars last week. So, X + 56 = 78. Subtracting 56 from both sides gives us X = 22. Since X = 22 and X represents the dollars Jason had last week, this is the correct answer.
