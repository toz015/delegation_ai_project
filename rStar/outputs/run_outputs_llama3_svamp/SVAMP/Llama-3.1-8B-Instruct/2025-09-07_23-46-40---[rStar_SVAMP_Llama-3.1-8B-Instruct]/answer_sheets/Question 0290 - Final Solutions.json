Yesterday, 197 chocolate chip cookies were made. Today, only 66 were made. To find the difference, we need to subtract how many were made today from how many were made yesterday. So 197 - 66 = 131. That is the difference. The answer is: 131. \n\nNote: Conditions 1 and 2 provide sufficient information to calculate the quantity of cookies baked each day, but they don't directly relate to the specific quantities of cookies mentioned (197 and 46) or imply any relationship between them other than providing additional context about baking activities over time. Therefore, interpretation might require further clarification based on actual instructions or conditions related to the quantities. However, following the general problem-solving approach as requested, let's solve it focusing on calculating differences based on provided numbers. The focus here remains on understanding the comparison between quantities baked yesterday versus today, keeping in mind potential variations in interpretation based on actual problem requirements.", "value": 0.8125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
