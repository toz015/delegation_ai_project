Let's find out how many invitations Carol bought in the packages first. Since she bought 6 packages of 14 invitations per package, we can calculate this as 6 x 14 = 84. Next, let's find out the total number of invitations she bought, which is 84 + 11 = 95. Finally, since we already know the number of invitations in the packages, the answer to our original question is indeed 84. The answer is: 84.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the total number of invitations Carol can send to her friends?", "subanswer": {"text": "To get the total number of invitations, let's just add the number of extra invitations and the number in the packages together, which results in 84 + 11 = 95.
