Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of sugar to match the ratio of sugar to flour as specified in the cake recipe. Since Mary already has 11 cups of flour, she needs to add 5 - (11/14 * 5) cups of sugar. 11/14 * 5 equals 3.929. Subtracting this value from 5 equals 1.071. This means she needs to add 1 more than 1 cup of sugar to match the ratio, but we don't know what rounding method was used here, so for simplicity we just say she needs 1 cup of sugar more compared to the flour.
