But remember that we counted the original amount of marbles as part of the losses, when we subtracted it in the previous line. Since he wasn't losing them anymore, but rather gaining 8 additional marbles to what he already had (which were taken from him first), we should count what he got back as gains too. If he didn't lose 16 marbles, but 24 instead, he would have 0 if he lost exactly that much. We know he found 8 more and didn't take anything from himself, so in reality, he lost 16, which is correct. The number of marbles he found doesn't contribute to whether he lost or gained any marbles; it just tells us he found some. To get the real difference between what he lost and what he found, we have to set aside the 4 he originally had and just consider what happened with the rest of his marbles. Since he had an original 4 marbles that aren't being considered here, we're only looking at the differences between 16 and 8. This isn't really different, though. You see, you simply need to look at the absolute value of the marble count difference between his original number and final, adding both loss and gain: 4 + 16 - 8. Subtracting 8 will yield the same result as adding its opposite, +8. Adding or subtracting 8 cancels out the problem; either way, you still have 16 - 8 = 8.
