Step 1: Convert the complex number z to polar form by finding the magnitude r and argument \u03b8 of z. To do this, recall that the magnitude of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. For z, we have a = $2 + \\sqrt{2}$ and b = $-(3+3\\sqrt{2})$, so we can compute the magnitude r as $r = \\sqrt{(2 + \\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2})^2}$. After some simplification, we obtain $r = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$. Similarly, the argument \u03b8 can be found using the formula $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)$. Plugging in the values of a and b, we get $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{-3-3\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$.
