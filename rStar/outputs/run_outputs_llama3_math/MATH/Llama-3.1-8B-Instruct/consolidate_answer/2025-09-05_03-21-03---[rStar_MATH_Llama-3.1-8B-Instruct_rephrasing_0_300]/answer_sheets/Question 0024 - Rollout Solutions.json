If the interest rate were greater than zero, the value of the account at the end of the third year would be higher. Thus, the interest rate can be made larger, and so we conclude that the minimum interest rate that the savings account must provide is a rate $r\\gt0.$\n\nNow let's think about what happens if we make this rate very small, $r=0.001,$ say.

Dividing both sides of this equation by $20000$ yields $(1+r)^3 = 3.3100$. Taking cube root of both sides leads to $1+r = 1.10$, which means $r=1.10-1=0.10$.
