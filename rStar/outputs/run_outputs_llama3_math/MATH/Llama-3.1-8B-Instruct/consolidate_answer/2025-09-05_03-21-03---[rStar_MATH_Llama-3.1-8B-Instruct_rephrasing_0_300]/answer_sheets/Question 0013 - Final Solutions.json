To determine the length of side $AC$, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, since triangle $\\triangle BCA$ is a right triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that for any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our case, the hypotenuse is side $BC$ with length $10$. One of the legs is side $AB$ with length $8$. The other leg is side $AC$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get $10^2=AC^2+8^2\\Rightarrow AC^2=100-64\\Rightarrow AC^2=36\\Rightarrow AC=\\sqrt{36}=6.$ Therefore, the length of side $AC$ is $\\boxed{6}$.
