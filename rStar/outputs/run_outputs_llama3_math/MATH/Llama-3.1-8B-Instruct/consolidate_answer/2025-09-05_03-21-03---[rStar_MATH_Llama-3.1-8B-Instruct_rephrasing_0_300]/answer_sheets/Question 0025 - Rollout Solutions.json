From Condition 1, substituting $x=y=0$, we get $f(0)+f(0)=f(0)-0\\cdot0-1$. Solving for $f(0)$, we get $f(0)=1$. Now, let us substitute $y=-x$ into Condition 1 to obtain $$f(x)+f(-x)=f(0)-x^2-1.$$ Because $f(x)+f(-x)=f(0)$ whenever $f$ is odd, it follows that $f(0)-x^2-1=f(0)$ so that $x^2=-1$, which implies that no such value exists. Hence, $f(x)$ cannot be an odd function. Thus, $f(x)$ is not an odd function. Now, let us assume that $f(x)=g(x^2)$ for some function $g$. Substituting $y=x^2$, we get \\begin{align*}\ng(x^2)+g(y^2)&amp;=g((x+y)^2)-(xy)^2-1\\\\\n&amp;=(x^2+2xy+y^2)+(x^2+2xy", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
