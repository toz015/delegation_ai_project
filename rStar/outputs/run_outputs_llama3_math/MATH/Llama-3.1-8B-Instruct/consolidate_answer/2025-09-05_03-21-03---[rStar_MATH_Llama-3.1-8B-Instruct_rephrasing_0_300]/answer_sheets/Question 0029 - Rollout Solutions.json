We need to figure out how many ways the soldiers can be organized into battalions under the given constraints. According to condition 3, each battalion must contain exactly 4 upper class and 8 lower class soldiers.

Now, we need to figure out the total number of battalions that can be formed using the upper-class and lower-class soldiers. For every battalion, we use 4 upper-class and 8 lower-class soldiers. Thus, every time we select one battalion, we use up 12 of our 15 soldiers. If you choose one battalion, then there are 3 upper-class and 2 lower-class soldiers left over.
