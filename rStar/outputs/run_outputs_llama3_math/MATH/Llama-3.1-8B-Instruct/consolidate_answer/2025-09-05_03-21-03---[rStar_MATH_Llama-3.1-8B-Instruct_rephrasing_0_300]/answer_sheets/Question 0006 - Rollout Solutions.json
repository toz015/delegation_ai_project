However, since 0 is an integer and n>0, let's check if the number of a negative n >0 yields a perfect cube. But n cannot be negative because if n<0 then the 3n would not be positive, since 3 times a negative number is always negative. Furthermore, let's consider the next lower integer less than 1 i.e. n=-1. Then 3n=(-3), which again doesn't yield a positive perfect cube, since negative number multiplied by 3 remains negative. So now we try the next lowest integer i.e. n=0, however 3*0=0. Therefore n must be greater than 0. Therefore the only remaining possibilities are n=1 and n=2. Because when n is an integer, 3n is a multiple of 3, therefore, when divided by 3 it leaves remainder zero which further implies that 3n will be divisible by 3. Thus, if 3n is not divisible by 3 then either n is not an integer or n is negative. Hence, n should be at least 1 for getting a non-zero remainder while dividing 3n by 3.
