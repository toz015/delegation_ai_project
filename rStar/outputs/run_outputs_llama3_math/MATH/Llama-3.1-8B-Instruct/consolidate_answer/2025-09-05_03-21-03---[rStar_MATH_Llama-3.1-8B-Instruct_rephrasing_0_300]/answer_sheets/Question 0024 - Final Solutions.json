Dividing both sides of this equation by $20000$ yields $(1+r)^3 = 3.3100$. Taking cube root of both sides leads to $1+r = 1.10$, which means $r=1.10-1=0.10$.

Let x be the interest rate. After one year, the first deposit becomes $20,000(1+x)$. After two years, the second deposit becomes $20,000(1+x)(1+x)=40000(1+x)^2$. After three years, the total in the savings account is $20,000+20,000(1+x)+40000(1+x)^2$, which is equal to $60,000+40000(1+x)^2$. Thus, we get $40000(1+x)^2=66000-(20,000)$ because after 3 years, we need $66000$ dollars. Solving for the term involving x: $(1+x)^2=(66000-20,000)/40,000=64/40=8/5$.
