To start with, as you suggested, ignoring the constraint that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas cannot sit together, there are indeed $6!$ distinct ways to seat them around the circular table.

The key observation here is that any arrangement where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit consecutively would represent $1/3$ of the possible seating arrangements without any such restriction because they could swap places with each other while still satisfying the no-consecutive rule. Hence, we need to multiply the total number of arrangements by $1/3$, but since the problem asks for the number of arrangements that don't violate the rule, we'll simply calculate $6! * (2/3)$.
