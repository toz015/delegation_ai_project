However, since 0 is an integer and n>0, let's check if the number of a negative n >0 yields a perfect cube. But n cannot be negative because if n<0 then the 3n would not be positive, since 3 times a negative number is always negative. Furthermore, let's consider the next lower integer less than 1 i.e. n=-1. Then 3n=(-3), which again doesn't yield a positive perfect cube, since negative number multiplied by 3 remains negative. So now we try the next lowest integer i.e. n=0, however 3*0=0. Therefore n must be greater than 0. Therefore the only remaining possibilities are n=1 and n=2. Because when n is an integer, 3n is a multiple of 3, therefore, when divided by 3 it leaves remainder zero which further implies that 3n will be divisible by 3. Thus, if 3n is not divisible by 3 then either n is not an integer or n is negative. Hence, n should be at least 1 for getting a non-zero remainder while dividing 3n by 3. As already proven earlier, n=1 doesn\u2019t work and hence the next candidate is n=2. It follows that we need to show that n=1 is the only smallest n that works and hence the question boils down to showing that 3*(n-1)=3*n-3 does not yield a perfect cube when n<2. Indeed, let\u2019s prove that. 3*(n-1) will be 0 when n=1 and -3, -6, etc., when n=0 and n<-1 respectively which shows that if n is a negative integer or n=0, then 3*(n-1) does not give a positive perfect cube.

So the sum of the integers is $9 + 10 + 11 = 30$. We now look for a perfect cube that equals 30. Because we want the smallest perfect cube and 30 is not a perfect cube itself, we try multiples of 30 until we get a perfect cube. We start with the next lowest multiple of 30 which is 60, but this is still not a perfect cube, so we continue with the next highest multiple which is 90. Still, we don't have a perfect cube here, so our next choice would be 120. But again this is not a perfect cube, and since the problem only asks for the \"smallest\" perfect cube, we go back to the lower multiple of 30 and check them again. This time we test 30 itself. Checking if 30 is a perfect cube we find out it is indeed a perfect cube because $3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 243$ and we are looking for the cube root of 30. So $3^{*3}=\\sqrt[3]{30}$ is about $3.07$. Thus, we can't use $3$ and we can't use $4$ either because its too big, so we try the next whole number after 3, which is 4, nope too big and that leaves 3. The next whole number below 3 is 2, so we use $2^3$, nope still too big (that is $8$), so we try the next whole number which is 1. And lo and behold, $1^{*3}=\\sqrt[3]{30} \\approx .464$ . So the closest cube root of 30 is actually 3. Which is why 30 is actually a perfect cube ($3^{*3}=\\sqrt[3]{30} \\approx 3.07$). We made a mistake earlier when we said you had to go higher than 30 to find a perfect cube.
