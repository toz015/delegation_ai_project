Multiplying both sides by $z^2$ yields $z^6 + z^2 + z^4 = 0.$ By rearranging, we get $z^6+z^4+z^2=0\\Rightarrow(z^6+z^4)+(z^2)=0\\Rightarrow(z^2+1)(z^4-z^2+1)=0.$ This implies either $z^2+1=0$ or $z^4-z^2+1=0.$ Solving the first equation, we obtain $z=\\pm i.$ Solving the second equation, we obtain $z=e^{(2k+1)\\pi i/3},$ where $k=0,1,\\dots,5.$ These six roots include all the primitive sixth roots of unity. Thus, each root is a $6^{\\text{th}}$ root of unity. Therefore, all the roots of $z^4 + z^2 + 1 = 0$ are $\\boxed{6^{\\text{th}}}$ roots of unity.
