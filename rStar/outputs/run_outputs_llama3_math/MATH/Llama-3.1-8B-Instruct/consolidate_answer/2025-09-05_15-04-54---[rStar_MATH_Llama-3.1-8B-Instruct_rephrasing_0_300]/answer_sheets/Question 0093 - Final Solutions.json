Now we can rewrite the equation as follows: $$\\left(x+\\frac{-7/2}{1}\\right)^2 -\\frac{49}{4} + y^2=9.$$Similarly, for the $y$ terms, we need to complete the square inside the parentheses of the second term. We do this by taking half the coefficient of the $y$, squaring it, and adding it to both sides of the equation. In this case, we take half the coefficient of the $y$, which is $\\frac{-10}{2}$, and square it, which equals $\\left(\\frac{-10}{2}\\right)^2=25$.
