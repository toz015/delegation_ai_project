Recall that we're trying to find the value of $b$. In order to find $b$, we can look at the coefficient of the linear term of the expanded polynomial (that is, the term involving just one variable without any exponent on it). We see that this is $5t(b)+(-2)(t) = t(5b-2)$. However, looking back at Condition 2, we know that this term must equal the $-16t$ term.
