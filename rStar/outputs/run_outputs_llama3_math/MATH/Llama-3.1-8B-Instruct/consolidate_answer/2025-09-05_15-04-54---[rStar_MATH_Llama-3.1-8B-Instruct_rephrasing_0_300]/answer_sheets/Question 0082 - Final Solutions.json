We substitute y1=2,x1=2,y2=2,x2=4 into the formula to get m=(2-2)/(4-2)=0/2=0. However, we cannot use this result as our maximum slope; it is zero. Hence, let\u2019s re-check our point selections. As hinted previously, we want to place point B below the horizontal position of point A as much as possible. By looking at both squares, we see that point B can be placed at point (4,3), and point A should still remain at (2,2) because we can\u2019t make the point B go lower than (4,2), since it already lies on the square.
