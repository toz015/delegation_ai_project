To determine how the degree of the polynomial changes after expanding the binomial, let's recall some properties of binomial expansions. When expanding the expression $(a+b)^n$, the general form of the terms is $C(n,k)a^{nk}b^k$, where $C(n,k)$ is the combination of n items taken k at a time. Now, in our expression $\\left(10x^3-\\frac{1}{2x^2}\\right)^{5}$, we see that when the powers of x add up, we get the highest power of the resulting polynomial.
