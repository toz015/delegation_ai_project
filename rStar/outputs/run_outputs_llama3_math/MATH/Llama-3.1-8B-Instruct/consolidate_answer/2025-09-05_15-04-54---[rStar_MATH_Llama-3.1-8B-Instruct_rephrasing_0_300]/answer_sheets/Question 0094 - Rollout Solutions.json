Let's look at triangle $ADC$. The three angles in any triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, so we get $$100^{\\circ}+50^{\\circ}+x=180^{\\circ}\\Rightarrow x=30^{\\circ}.$$ Now let's look at triangle $ABC$. Again, since all three angles must add up to $180^{\\circ}$, we get\\begin{align*}\n    y+50^{\\circ}+110^{\\circ}&amp;=180^{\\circ}\\\\\n    \\Rightarrow\\qquad y&amp;=20^{\\circ}.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the sum of angles $x$ and $y$ in terms of degrees is $\\boxed{x+y=30+20=50}$ degrees.

Angle BAD is trisected into three equal angles, each measuring $100/3$. Similarly, angle CDA is trisected into three equal angles, each measuring $110/3$. Now consider triangle AED. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees.
