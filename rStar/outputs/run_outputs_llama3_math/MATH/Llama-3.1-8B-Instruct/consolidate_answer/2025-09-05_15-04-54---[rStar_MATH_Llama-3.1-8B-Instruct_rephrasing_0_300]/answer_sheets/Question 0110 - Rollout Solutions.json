We use the fact that $r = \\dfrac{a_{2k}}{a_{2k-1}}$. Since this ratio holds for any $k$, it also holds when $k=7$. This implies $r^2 = \\dfrac{a_{15}}{a_{13}}$. Given that $a_{13}=2016$, we know that $a_{15}=r^2\\cdot 2016$. But since $a_{17}$ is the next term in the geometric sequence and also part of the arithmetic sequence, we know that $$a_{16} + r=a_{17}\\implies a_{15} + ar+a_{16}=a_{17}.$$ Simplifying, $r(a+r)=a_{17}-a_{15}$, so we get that \\begin{align*}\n    r^2 & = \\left(\\frac{a_{17}-a_{15}}{a+r}\\right)\\\\\n    & = \\frac{(a_{17}-a_{15})(r)}{ar}\\\\\n    & = \\frac{a_{17}(r)-a_{15}(r)}{ar}.\n\\end{align*} This simpl", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\\dots$ has the property that for every positive integer $k$, the subsequence $a_{2k-1}$, $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$ is geometric and the subsequence $a_{2k}$, $a_{2k+1}$, $a_{2k+2}$ is arithmetic.
