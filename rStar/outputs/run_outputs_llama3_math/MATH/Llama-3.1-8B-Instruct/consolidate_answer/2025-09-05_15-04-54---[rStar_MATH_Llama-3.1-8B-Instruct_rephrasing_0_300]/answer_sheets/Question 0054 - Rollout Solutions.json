To solve this problem, first identify the numerator and the denominator of the fraction $\\frac{3}{20}$. The numerator is 3 and the denominator is 20. Divide the numerator, 3, by the denominator, 20: $\\frac{3}{20}=0.15$. Thus the final answer is $\\frac{3}{20}$. However, since it asks for the numerator divided by the denominator, so the correct calculation is $3\\div 20=0.15$, hence, the numerator divided by the denominator is 0.15. The answer is: 0.15. \n\nThis conversation was created through a AI assistant and is for demonstration purposes only.
