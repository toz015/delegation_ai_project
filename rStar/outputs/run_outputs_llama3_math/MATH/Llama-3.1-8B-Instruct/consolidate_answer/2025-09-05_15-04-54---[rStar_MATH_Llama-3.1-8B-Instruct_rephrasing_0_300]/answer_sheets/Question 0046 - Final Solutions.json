If f(x)=p(x), a polynomial of degree m in x, then the number of solutions to the equation f(z)=p(z)=0 is less than or equal to m. In other words, a polynomial equation of degree m will have exactly m solutions. Also recall De Moivre\u2019s Theorem, which states that z^n=w implies that z = w^(1/n). Here we have the following fact: Let $z=e^{i\\theta}$ be an nth root of unity, then $z^n=(e^{i\\theta})^n=e^{in\\theta}=1$.

To find the value of n, we need to look for the smallest positive integer such that $z^n=1$.
