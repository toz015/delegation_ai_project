Using similar triangles, the minimum value is achieved when $x=20k$ and $y=50k$, so that the ratio of the $x$-coordinate to the $y$-coordinate matches the ratio of the $x$-coordinates and the $y$-coordinates of $(0,0)$ and $(20,50)$. If $0 \\le k \\le 1/2$, $x$ will range over $[0,10]$ and $y$ will range over $[0,25]$. The minimum value will occur along the line segment", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "When $(x,y)$ is on the line connecting $(20,50)$ and $(0,0)$, the expression becomes \\begin{align*}\n&amp;\\sqrt{20^2+50^2}+\\sqrt{k(20^2+50^2)}\\\\\n=&amp;70+k(70).\n\\end{align*}However, notice that we don't need to consider the entire region in which $0 \\le k \\le 1/2$ because $x$ and $y$ are restricted to the ranges $0 \\le x \\le 40$ and $0 \\le y \\le 50$.
