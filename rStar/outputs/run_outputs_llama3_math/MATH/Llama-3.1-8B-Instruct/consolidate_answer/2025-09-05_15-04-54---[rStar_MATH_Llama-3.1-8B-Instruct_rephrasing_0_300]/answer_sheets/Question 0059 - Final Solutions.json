There are 28 students who participate in MATHCOUNTS and 21 who participate in science club. When adding them together, some of those 28 and 21 students will appear in both lists. To correct for this double-counting, we need to first calculate the total number of students participating in either activity, and then determine the overlap between the activities. If we simply added 28 and 21, we would get 49 students, but since there are only 50 students in the entire class and 6 do not participate in either group, we know there must be an overlap. That overlap is found when we subtract 49 from 50, giving us the number of students counted twice because they belonged to both groups. The equation is therefore: $$\\left(28\\right)+\\left(21\\right)-49=50-49$$, yielding the solution: $$30=1.$$ This was just an intermediate calculation; the problem asks for how many students participate in both activities, so let's go back to the original question.
