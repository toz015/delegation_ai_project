First, let's see if 3339 is divisible by any small primes such as 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. If it is not divisible by these, we can move on to larger primes. We start by dividing 3339 by 3 since it is the smallest prime factor other than 2. Dividing 3339 by 3 results in 1113 with no remainder. Now we know 3339 is divisible by 3. Next, we need to determine if 1113 is also divisible by 3. When we divide 1113 by 3 we get 371 with no remainder. So, 1113 is also divisible by 3. Continuing, we divide 371 by 3, and it goes in once with a remainder of 229. Thus, 371 is not divisible by 3 but is divisible by 37 and 11. Therefore, we have found that 3339 = 3 * 3 * 37 * 11, which means that 3339 = 3^2 * 37 * 11.

Starting again at 3, we can see that it doesn't work because 2961 divided by three is 986 with a remainder of 3. Proceeding to 5, we can see that 2961/5 equals 592 with a remainder of 1. As 2961 cannot be evenly divided by the next prime, 7, or 11 either, our next option is 13. Dividing 2961 by 13 results in 227 with no remainder. Now we know 2961 is divisible by 13. Next, we check if 227 is also divisible by 13. But 227 isn't divisible by 13, as 227 divided by 13 leaves a remainder of 0; however, 227 is divisible by itself and 1, so it is a prime number. Thus, 2961 equals 13 times 227 (or $2961=13*227$), meaning that 2961 is equal to the product of 13 and 227. However, we still need to simplify the expression further. Looking back at 227, we can express 227 as a product of prime factors ($227=227*1$) because it is a prime number. Therefore, now we can write 2961 as a product of its prime factors ($2961=13*227=13*227*1$).

Moving on to the next prime, 5, and looking at 36, we realize that 36/5 is 7.2 with a remainder. Hence, moving on to the next prime, 7. Upon trying 7, we find that 36 / 7 leaves a remainder. Proceeding to 11, we obtain that 36 is divisible by 11. This implies that 36 = 11 * 3 + 3. Furthermore, upon factoring 3 out, we obtain 36 = 3(11+1). With a little rearrangement, this implies that $36=(11)(3)+3=(3)(11+1)=3\\cdot 12.$ Hence, we conclude that the greatest common factor of 3339 and 2961 and 1491 is indeed 3."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
