According to Condition 2, we're working with the tangent function. This means we need to relate the given equation to the definition of the tangent function. Recall that the tangent of an angle $x$, denoted as $\\tan(x)$, is equal to the ratio of the sine of $x$ to the cosine of $x$: $\\tan(x)=\\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}.$ Geometrically, the tangent represents the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle in a right triangle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle. However, since the problem doesn't provide any specific details about the geometry behind the given equation, we cannot draw a diagram. Nevertheless, knowing how to interpret this information about the tangent function helps us make sense of what it means in terms of the angle measures involved in the given equation. Therefore, tangent represents the ratio of the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.

We know that the tangent function takes real input values from a certain interval that satisfies $-\\pi/2 < x < \\pi/2$. Because we were told the angle measurements were in degrees, we convert the limits to degree format using the fact that $\\pi$ radians is equivalent to 180 degrees. Thus, the expression becomes $-\\pi/2 < x < \\pi/2$ or equivalently, $-90^\\circ < x < 90^\\circ.$ Therefore, we conclude that in order for the equation to hold true with $x > 0,$ $x$ cannot lie within this specified range where tangent would produce real output values. So, the only possibility left is to let $x$ take values greater than $90^\\circ$. Since the angles must satisfy $x > 0,$ we now conclude that our possible solution lies outside of the region bounded by $0 < x < 90^\\circ.$ The next option provided is that $0<x<180,$ so in conjunction with our established restriction, we have narrowed down the valid interval for x to be $$\\boxed{2$$ and $$2.$", "value": 0.0625}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
