Doing so yields $$5x - x = x + 3 + 1.$$This simplifies to$$4x=x+4,$$and further to$$3x=4.$$(Divide both sides by $3$.)Finally, solving for $x$ yields$\\boxed{x=4/3}$. The answer is: 4/3.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The first step is to get rid of the absolute value. To do this, we split into cases. Case 1: If $5x - 1 \\geq 0$, we can drop the absolute value bars and write the equation as $$5x - 1 = x + 3.$$ Solving for $x$ as in the hint yields $$x = \\frac{4}{3}.$$Case 2: If $5x - 1 < 0$, we flip the sign of the right-hand side of the equation. The resulting equation is $$-(5x - 1)=x + 3.$$Solving for $x$ yields $$-5x + 1=x + 3,$$so$$-6x=2$$and finally$$\\boxed{x=-1/3}.$$To determine which solution is larger, we can compare the fractions $x=-\\frac{1}{3}$ and $x=\\frac{4}{3}$.
