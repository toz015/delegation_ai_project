After finding another bag of coins, you now have a total of $7n+53$ coins. You decided to redistribute the coins into 8 bags. If you let $k$ represent the new number of coins in each bag after redistribution, then the equation expressing your new situation would be $8\\cdot k=7n+53$, because you're moving a total of $7n+53$ coins to bags numbered $1$ through $8$ such that every bag has the same amount of coins. To solve for the unknown variable $k$, substitute $n=(7n+53)/8$ into the previous equation; this would look like this: $$k=\\dfrac{7(7n+53)+53}{8}= 7n+\\dfrac{53}{8}(9)=7n+\\dfrac{477}{8}.$$We're informed that the number of total coins initially exceeds 200, meaning that $7n>200$.
