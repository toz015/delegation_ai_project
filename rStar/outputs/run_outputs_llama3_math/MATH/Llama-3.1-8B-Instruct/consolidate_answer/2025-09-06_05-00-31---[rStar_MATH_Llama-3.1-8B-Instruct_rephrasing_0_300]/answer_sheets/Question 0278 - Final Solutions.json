", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "What does the largest eight-digit base 2 integer look like?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We want the largest eight-digit base 2 integer. An eight-digit base 2 integer consists of eight digits, each of which is either 0 or 1. To maximize it, we put 1 in every digit so that the number becomes 11111111. Now we need to convert this number into decimal form. Let's break it down: The rightmost digit represents $2^0$, the second rightmost represents $2^1$, the third from the right represents $2^2$, and so on. Thus, the maximum value is $1\\times 2^{7}+1\\times 2^{6}+1\\times 2^{5}+1\\times 2^{4}+1\\times 2^{3}+1\\times 2^{2}+1\\times 2^{1}+1\\times 2^{0}=128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255.$ Therefore, the largest eight-digit base 2 integer looks like $\\boxed{255}$.
