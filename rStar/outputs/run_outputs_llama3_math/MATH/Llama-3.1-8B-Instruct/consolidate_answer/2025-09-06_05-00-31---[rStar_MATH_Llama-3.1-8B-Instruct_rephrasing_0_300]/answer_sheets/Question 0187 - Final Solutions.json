As stated in the problem, we have two equations: $a+b=11$ and $10a+5b=7.5$. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. I'll use substitution. If we multiply the first equation by $10$, we get $10a+10b=110$. Subtracting the second equation from this equation yields $5b=102.5$. Dividing both sides of this new equation by $5$, we obtain $\\frac{5b}{5}=\\frac{102.5}{5}\\implies b=\\frac{102.5}{5}=20.5$. This would mean that there are noninteger numbers of coins; therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect. I made another guess. Given the fact that there are 11 coins in total, I guessed the solution as follows: Let $a$ and $b$ be the number of dimes and nickels, respectively.
