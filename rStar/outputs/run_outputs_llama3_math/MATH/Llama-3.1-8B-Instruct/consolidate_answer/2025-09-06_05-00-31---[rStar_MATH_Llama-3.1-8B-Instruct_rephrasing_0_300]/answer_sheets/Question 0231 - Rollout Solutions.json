From condition 1, we know $A+B+C=18.$ From condition 2, we know $C-4=A,$ or equivalently, $C=A+4.$ Substituting into the previous equation yields $A+B+A+4=18\\implies A+B=14.$ Now, let's use condition 3. If we translate it to an equation, we get $B+4=(3/5)(A+4).$ Now, solve for B. Multiplying both sides by 5, we obtain 5(B+4)=3(A+4)\\implies5B+20=3A+12. Subtracting 12 from both sides and also subtracting 20 from both sides, we obtain 5B-8=3A-28\\implies5B=3A-20\\implies B=(3/5)A-4.\\text{ }\\text{ }Now,\\text{substitute}\\text{this value of }B\\text{ into our equation }A+B=14:\\text{ }A+\\left(\\frac{3}{5}A-4\\right)=14\\text{ }\\text{ }\\text{Solving for", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6.

Let $a$ represent Amy's current age, $b$ represent Ben's current age, and $c$ represent Chris's current age.
