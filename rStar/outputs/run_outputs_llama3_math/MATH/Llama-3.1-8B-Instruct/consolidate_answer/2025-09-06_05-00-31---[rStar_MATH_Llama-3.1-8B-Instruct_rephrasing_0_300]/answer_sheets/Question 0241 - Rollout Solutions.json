So we set $2x(2x^2-17.5)=0$, and solve for x. Setting each factor equal to zero and solving gives us either $x=0$ or $x^2=\\frac{17.5}{2}=8.75$. Because the quadratic equation represents distances, it cannot give negative results; therefore, $x^2=8.75$ is not possible. However, $x=0$ is a possibility since x is squared. If $x=0$, then the point is at the origin, so the minimum distance is $0$.\n\nNow, we need to check if this is indeed the absolute minimum by looking at the second derivative. This derivative will tell us whether the function is concave up or down around $x=0.$\n\nTo get our second derivative, we differentiate $2x(2x^2-17.5)$, which equals $2(2x^2-17.5)+4x^2\\cdot2x$.
