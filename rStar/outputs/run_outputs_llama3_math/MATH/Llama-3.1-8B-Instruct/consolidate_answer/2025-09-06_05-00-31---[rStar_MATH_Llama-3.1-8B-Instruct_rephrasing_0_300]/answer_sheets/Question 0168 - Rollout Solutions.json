The problem asks us to find how many of each type of square fits into the grid. For example, let's look at the $1\\times 1$ squares. If we consider the horizontal row of dots as the $x$-axis, and the vertical column of dots as the $y$-axis, we see that each square occupies one unit horizontally and one unit vertically. So, for every 3 units along the vertical axis, we get one new $1\\times 1$ square. If we let $n$ represent the total number of horizontal units, then the total number of $1\\times 1$ squares is simply $n$. Now, let's examine the $2\\times 2$ squares. Each of them takes up four units along both the horizontal and vertical axes. So, again using $n$ as our horizontal measure, we find that there are $\\frac{n}{2}$ $2\\times 2$ squares in the grid. Likewise, there are $\\frac{n}{3}$ $3\\times 3$ squares.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
