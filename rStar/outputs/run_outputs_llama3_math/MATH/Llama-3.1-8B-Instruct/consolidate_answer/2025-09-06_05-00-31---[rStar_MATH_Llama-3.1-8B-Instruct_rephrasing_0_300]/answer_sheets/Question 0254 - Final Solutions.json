To solve this problem, let's use the stars and bars method. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the number of chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies chosen, respectively. Note that since the order of selection does not matter, we need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $a+b+c=6$. For this purpose, it will be helpful to visualize the possible combinations of $a,b,$ and $c$ as points in space. We can make a coordinate system with $a$ on the x-axis, $b$ on the y-axis, and $c$ on the z-axis. Thus the total number of points that satisfy the equation is the number of lattice points inside the box bounded by the planes $x+y+z=6,x=0,y=0,z=0$. It is easy to see that the number of ways to choose $a$ out of 6 is ${6\\choose a}$. Hence the number of ways to select $a,b,c$ is equal to the number of lattice points inside the above region.
