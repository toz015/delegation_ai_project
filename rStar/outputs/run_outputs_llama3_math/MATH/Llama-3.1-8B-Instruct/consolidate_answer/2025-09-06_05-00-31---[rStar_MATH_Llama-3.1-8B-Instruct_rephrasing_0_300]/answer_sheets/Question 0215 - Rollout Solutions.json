Factoring the first term further, we get $(x+1)(x-1)(x+1)-1 = (x+1)^2(x-1)-1 = (x^2+2x+1)(x-1)-(x^2+2x+1) = x^3-x^2+2x^2-2x+x-1-x^2-2x-1 = x^3-2x+1$ as desired. Therefore, solving $x^2-x-1=0$ using the quadratic formula isn't necessary; instead, we find the value of $x^3-2x+1$ directly by applying Vieta's formulas. Since the sum of the roots of $x^2-x-1=0$ is $1$ and their product is $-1$, we see that \\begin{align*}", "value": 0.0625}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "If $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, what is the value of $x^3 - 2x + 1$?", "ost_step": {"1": "To solve the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, we'll use the quadratic formula.", "2": "The roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.", "3": "For our equation, $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-1$.", "4": "Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{-(-1)\\pm\\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4}}{2}=\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{5}}{2}$."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
