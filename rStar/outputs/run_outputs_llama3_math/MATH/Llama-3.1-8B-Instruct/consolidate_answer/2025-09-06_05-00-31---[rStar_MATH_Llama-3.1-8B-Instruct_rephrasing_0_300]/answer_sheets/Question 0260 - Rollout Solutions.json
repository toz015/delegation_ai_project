Simplifying further, we get the equation $y^2+10y-96=0$, which is equivalent to $(y-4)(y+24)=0$. Solving for y, we get either $y=4$ or $y=-24$. However, condition (v) states that $y>x$, so $y\\neq x$. Hence $y$ cannot equal 10. Now let us substitute $y=4$ into $y^2=160$, which was obtained earlier from condition (ii). This yields $16=160$, which is false. Therefore, $y$ cannot equal 4. Thus, $y=-24$. Substituting this value of y into the equation $z+w=12$, we obtain $z-24=12\\implies z=36$.
