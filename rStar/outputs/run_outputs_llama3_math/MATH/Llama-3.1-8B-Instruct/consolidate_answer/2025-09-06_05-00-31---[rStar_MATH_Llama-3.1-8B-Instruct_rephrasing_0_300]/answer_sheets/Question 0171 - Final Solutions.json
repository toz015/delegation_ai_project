To solve this problem, we need to add up the fractions of the pie that Louis and Jack eat.

Let's do that now: The fraction $\\frac{1}{5}$ is equal to $\\frac{1\\times 3}{5\\times 3} = \\frac{3}{15}.$ Similarly, the fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ is equal to $\\frac{2\\times 5}{3\\times 5} = \\frac{10}{15}.$ Therefore, the total fraction of pie eaten by Louis and Jack is $\\frac{3}{15}+\\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}$ of the pie.

We know from condition 2 that Louis eats $\\frac{1}{5}$ of the pie. Jack also eats a certain fraction of the pie. To find the fraction that Jack eats, we'll add Jack's portion to Louis'. If Louis eats $\\frac{1}{5}$ and Jack eats $\\frac{2}{3}$, the combined fraction is $\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{2}{3}$. To do the addition, first, convert both fractions to have common denominators.
