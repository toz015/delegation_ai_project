They make a profit of 0.40 dollars per loaf of whole wheat bread and 0.50 dollars per loaf of white bread. If x represents the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold and y represents the number of loaves of white bread sold, what is the value of x when y is equal to 150? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: To find the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold, we need to use a system of linear equations. The first equation comes from the fact that the bakery sells a total of 480 loaves per day: x + y = 480. Step 2: The second equation comes from the fact that they make a profit of 0.40 dollars per loaf of whole wheat bread and 0.50 dollars per loaf of white bread: 0.40x + 0.50y = profit. However, since we're not told what the profit is, we don't actually need this second equation. Instead, we can just solve the first equation for x: x = 480 - y.
