There is an overlap of a radius of one around the square in the middle, because that\u2019s how circles and squares work. However, this square does not include the interior of the nonagon but only its boundary. Thus, it encloses an additional area of 2*sqrt(3). This is because there are 4 of those triangles that add up to a full nonagon. Then the total area is pi*(1)^2 + (3+4)*sqrt(3) + pi*(side/2)^2 + 3(side/2)^2 - 2*sqrt(3), which is pi + pi + 7*sqrt(3) + pi + 3 - 2*sqrt(3) = 2pi + 5*sqrt(3) + 3.

Therefore, there is a circle around each corner of the nonagon with radius 1 unit such that no points are outside of the circles but still on the nonagon\u2019s perimeter. This circle overlaps another circle on the opposite side, making a line segment of length 2. In fact, this applies to every pair of diagonally opposite vertices. Hence, we conclude that if we draw lines connecting the centers of each pair of overlapping circles (i.e., diagonals), we would end up dividing the regular nonagon into smaller nonagons (not necessarily regular). It also means that each pair of points within the overlapping circles\u2019 radii will also form a chord of length 2 on the nonagon\u2019s perimeter. Thus, in order to calculate the total number of these pairs, we need to divide the total number of sides of the larger nonagon by 2. That yields the answer of how many smaller nonagons we have. Next, we need to add the total number of sides of all the smaller nonagons together. With some algebraic manipulation, you can determine that the sum of the lengths of the boundaries of the smaller nonagons equals the length of the boundary of the large nonagon minus the length of the chord of each smaller nonagon times the number of smaller nonagons. So we should multiply the number of smaller nonagons by 2 (because each smaller nonagon contributes 2 edges) and then subtract this product by the length of the boundary of the large nonagon. Therefore, we have $9 * 2 - 2 * 9 = 18 - 18 = 0$ (this shows that there are 0 smaller chords of length 2 units on the nonagon\u2019s boundary) and thus the total perimeter of S is simply equal to the length of the original nonagon's boundary which is equal to the number of sides multiplied by the length of each side.
