From condition 1, we know that we need to solve the equation $\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{4}{x-5}$ for $x$. From condition 2, we also know that there are no restrictions on the variable $x$, so we don't need any restrictions when solving this equation. To start, we'll cross-multiply the fractions to get rid of the denominators: $2(x-5)=12$. Now, let's distribute the $2$ to the terms inside the parentheses: $2x-10=12$. Adding $10$ to both sides of the equation yields $2x=22$. Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by $2$ gives us the value of $x$: $x=\\frac{22}{2}=11$.
