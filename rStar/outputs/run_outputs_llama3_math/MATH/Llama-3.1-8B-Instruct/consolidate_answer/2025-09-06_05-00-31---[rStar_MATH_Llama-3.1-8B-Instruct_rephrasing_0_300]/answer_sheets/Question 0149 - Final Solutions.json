To solve this problem, let's first use Conditions 1 and 3. From Condition 1, we see that Rosa's age is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, or 6. This implies that it is one more than a multiple of 12. We can check some multiples of 12 to see what values satisfy Condition 1. For example, if Rosa were 13 years old (which is one more than a multiple of 12), she would not meet Condition 2 because when you divide 13 by 7, you don't get 0 as a remainder. However, if Rosa were 39 years old (which is also one more than a multiple of 12), she wouldn't meet Condition 2 either since when you divide 39 by 7, you get a remainder of 4 instead of 0. On the other hand, if Rosa were 78 years old (which is 6 times 12 plus 6), she meets both Condition 2 and Condition 3. Furthermore, when you divide 78 by each of the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6, you get a remainder of 0 for each divisor", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
