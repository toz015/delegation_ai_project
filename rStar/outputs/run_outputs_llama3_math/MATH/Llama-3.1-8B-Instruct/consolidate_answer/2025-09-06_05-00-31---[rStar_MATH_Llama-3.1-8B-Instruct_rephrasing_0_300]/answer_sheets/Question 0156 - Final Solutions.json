The time it takes both runners to reach a certain point is proportional to the distance between them. Let's say the initial distance between points A and O is 0. So when runner A covers a distance d, then runner B covers the same distance d and also reaches the point O. In terms of v, the ratio of the distances covered by the two runners is equal to the inverse of their speeds. Given that runner B runs at a speed of three times that of runner A, the ratio of the distances covered by runner A and runner B is equal to the speed of runner B divided by the speed of runner A, which is 3/1 or simply 3. Thus, the distance covered by runner A is 3x, while the distance covered by runner B is x. Now let's determine how far each runner travels. If the distance traveled by runner A is 3x, then he travels 3x distance units from his starting position.

To solve this problem, let's analyze the situation when runner A reaches the highest point on the track (assuming the track extends infinitely upwards). As soon as A is at its highest point, we immediately notice that the angle will become smaller because the distance between A and B decreases.
