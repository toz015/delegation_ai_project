Because the entire board is symmetric with respect to reflection over any axis passing horizontally through the middle, the same thing applies whenever either of the above mentioned cases occurs but in reverse order. For instance, it could happen that the row and the column intersect due to a remainder of $3$ or a remainder of $1$. Thus, regardless of whether we choose row 1 and column 1 or row 3 and column 3 as our example, there exists symmetry which causes us to see four squares, out of $15$ total, that contain shades.
