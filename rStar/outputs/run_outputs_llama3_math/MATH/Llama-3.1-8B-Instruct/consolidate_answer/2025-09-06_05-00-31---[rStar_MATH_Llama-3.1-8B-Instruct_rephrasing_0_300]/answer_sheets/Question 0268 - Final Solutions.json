The sum of the first nine terms is $1+2+\\cdots+9=45$. Now, adding the tenth term, we get the new sum as $45+a$, where $a$ represents the tenth term, which is $10$. Adding $10$ to $45$, we get $55=a+45$. Now, let's rewrite this equation as follows: $a+45 \\equiv S \\pmod{9}$. We know that $45 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9}$ because it is perfectly divisible by 9. Hence, we have the following: $a \\equiv S \\pmod{9}$. Finally, since we have $10$, we can replace 'a' with 10. Therefore, we have $10 \\equiv S \\pmod{9}$.\nWe know that $10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$.
