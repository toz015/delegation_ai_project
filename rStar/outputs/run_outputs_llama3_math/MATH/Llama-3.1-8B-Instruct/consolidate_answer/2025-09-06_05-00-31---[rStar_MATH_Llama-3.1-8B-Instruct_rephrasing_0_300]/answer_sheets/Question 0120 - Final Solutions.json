Since $f(x)$ is odd and $g(x)$ is even, the composition of these two functions also results in an odd function, i.e., $f(g(x))$ has an odd symmetry property because $f(g(-a))=f(g(a))$. Further applying $f$ again, since $f(g(x))$ has an odd symmetry property, $f(f(g(x)))$ would have an odd symmetry property as well. Now, considering $g(x)$ which is an even function, and taking into account that $f(f(g(x)))$ has an odd symmetry property, $g(f(f(g(x))))$ would have an even symmetry property. Finally, further application of the function $f$ to $g(f(f(g(x))))$ would negate the symmetry property resulting in an odd symmetry property. Therefore, $f(f(g(f(g(f(x))))))$ is $\\boxed{odd}$.
