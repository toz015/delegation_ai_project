However, let's break it down logically. AB is parallel to DE, meaning that BC is perpendicular to both AB and DE. Triangle ABC is a right triangle, so you could find its height and base. For triangle CDE, since BD=4BC, we know that DE is four times as long as BC and D has been moved four times as far away from E as C is from B. This means that if we draw an altitude from D to BC, that altitude would be one-quarter the length of the altitude from A to BC because they share the same base and their heights relate in a ratio of 4:1. Now, considering how areas of triangles are calculated and knowing that the altitudes from A to BC and from D to BC relate in a 4:1 ratio, we can conclude that the area of triangle CDE is equal to the area of triangle ABC divided by 4.

Since lines AB and DE are parallel, alternate interior angles formed by transversal BE are congruent. Hence, angle ABE = angle CED. By condition 2, line BD is parallel to CE.

If you let CD equal x, then BD would equal 4x, ED would equal 4/3*x, AD would equal 7/3*x, AE would equal 17/3*x, and AB would equal 13/3*x. Also, since triangles are similar, ratio of areas of two figures with proportional side lengths is the square of the ratio of the length of any pair of corresponding sides. Now, let us consider the areas of triangles DEC and ABE. Area of ABE = 6 square centimeters Area of DEC = 36 / 169 * 6 = 216 / 169 = 6 / (169/36).

Remember when I said earlier that the ratio of DEC\u2019s area to ABE\u2019s area was 169/81? To solve the problem, I need to set up a proportion like this one: (Area of DEC/Area of ABE) = 169/81 = (Area of DEC/Area of ABC)/1 So if (Area of DEC/Area of ABC)=169/81, then (DEC\u2019s area/ABC\u2019s area)*ABC\u2019s area=169/81*ABC\u2019s area.
