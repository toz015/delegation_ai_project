Therefore, we know that triangle $HNH$ is isosceles. Since $HN=HO$, it follows that $\\angle J = \\angle H$. Thus, the sum of angles $J$ and $H$ is twice angle $H$: $m\\angle J+m\\angle H=180^\\circ$. Therefore, the sum of angles $J$ and $H$ is $\\boxed{180^\\circ}$. The answer is: 180^{\\circ}.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 14}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Condition 2: In circle J, lines HO and HN are tangent to the circle at points O and N. Condition 3: We need to find the measure of the sum of angles m\u2220J and m\u2220H. Question: What is the number of degrees in the sum of $m\\angle J$ and $m\\angle H$?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Lines HO and HN are tangents to circle J. This means that \u2220JHO and \u2220HNJ are right angles because tangents create right angles with radii. Also, since arc HN subtends both \u2220JOH and \u2220JNH at the center, it also subtends \u2220J and \u2220H at the circumference. Furthermore, arc NH subtends \u2220JNH and \u2220JOH at the circumference. By the Inversion Property, arc HN must be half as large as the central angle, so arc HN measures 90\u00b0. So m\u2220J+m\u2220H=m\u2220JOH+m\u2220JNH=(1/2)m\u2220JHO+(1/2)m\u2220HNJ=45\u00b0+45\u00b0=90\u00b0. The answer is: 90.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
