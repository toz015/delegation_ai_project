Since each exterior angle at vertex I measures 72 degrees (since the regular pentagon's interior angle measures 108 degrees and the straight line angle at vertex J is 180 degrees), angle A plus 72 degrees equals 180 degrees. Subtracting 72 degrees from both sides yields that angle A is equal to 108 degrees. Therefore, angle A measures $\\boxed{108}$ degrees.
