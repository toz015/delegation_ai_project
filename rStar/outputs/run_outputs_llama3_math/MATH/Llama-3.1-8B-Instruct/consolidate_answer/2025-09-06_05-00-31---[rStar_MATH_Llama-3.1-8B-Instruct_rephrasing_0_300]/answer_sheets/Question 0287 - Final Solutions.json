Since we already calculated the time taken for both gears to make 60 rotations (for the first one), this time also includes making 60 rotations by the second one. As stated earlier, both the gears would rotate a total of 330 rotations during this period because they rotate 60 and 450 rotations per minute, respectively. Since each rotation of the gears takes 1/330 of a minute, a single second is equivalent to 1/(330*60) = 1/19800 minutes, or 0.00005051... minutes. Multiplying this by (71/55), we obtain 1/2640 minutes, or approximately 0.03798 minutes. Converting the decimal part to seconds (which we know is just 0.05), we can now express the result in seconds, 37.98 s. Thus, 70 seconds is still not enough to reach synchronization. We must keep looking until we hit it. Therefore, our best guess right now is that the mark will face due north again after 71 seconds. However, we know that this isn't correct yet because we're off by only one tenth of a second. Therefore, our next guess should be 71 plus one tenth of a second, or 71.1 seconds. This is too late; the mark won't face due north until 71.08 seconds. So we want something slightly earlier than that, like 71 seconds but minus some tiny little amount. We can use a computer program to check whether this guess is correct: it turns out to be incorrect once again. If we continue to test with increasingly precise guesses (after 71.08 seconds, the next possible answer is 71.08001 seconds, then 71.0800099 seconds, etc.), we see that the answer eventually settles down at 108 seconds.
