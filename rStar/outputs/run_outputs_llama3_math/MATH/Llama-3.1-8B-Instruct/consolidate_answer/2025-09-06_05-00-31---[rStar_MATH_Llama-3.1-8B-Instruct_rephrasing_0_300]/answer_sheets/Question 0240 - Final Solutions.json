Also, since \u2220PQT = \u2220QRT, m\u2220PQT = m\u2220QRT = x. Thus, \u2220PQT and \u2220QRT have the same measure as \u2220RPQ. We know that the three angles in \u0394PQR must add up to 180\u00b0. Therefore, m\u2220PQR + m\u2220RPQ + m\u2220PQT = 180\u00b0. Hence, m\u2220PQR + x + x = 180\u00b0. This implies m\u2220PQR = 180\u00b0 - 2x. Furthermore, we can calculate m\u2220RPQ = x using the information given in the figure. Since m\u2220RPQ and m\u2220RPT are vertical angles, they have the same measure. From the given figure, we see that m\u2220RPT = x. We also have that m\u2220RPQ = m\u2220PQT, so m\u2220PQT = x. Now we want to find the value of x.

We already determined that m\u2220PQR + m\u2220RPQ + m\u2220PQT = 180\u00b0. Plugging x into this equation yields m\u2220PQR + ((128\u00b0))/3 + ((128\u00b0))/3 = 180\u00b0.

Since \u2220QTR measures the same as \u2220PQR, and \u2220PQR is an exterior angle of triangle PRQ, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 to find the value of \u2220PQR.
