Since the given equation is valid for all real values of x except -8 and 3, we know that the left-hand side must be equivalent to the right-hand side when x is not equal to -8 or 3. First, we need to simplify the fraction on the right-hand side so that it matches the form of the fractions on the left-hand side. The denominator of the fraction on the right-hand side is (x\u22124)(x+6). To match the denominators on the left-hand side, we need the numerators C(x+8) and D(x\u22123) to contain the factors (x\u22124) and (x+6), respectively. Thus, C contains the factor (x\u22124), and D contains the factor (x+6). We also notice that the numerator of the fraction on the right-hand side is 4x\u221223. In order for the fractions on both sides to be equivalent, the numerators must be proportional. Therefore, we need to have C(x+8)(x+6) and D(x\u22123)(x\u22124) such that their ratio equals the ratio of 4x\u221223 to (x\u22124)(x+6).
