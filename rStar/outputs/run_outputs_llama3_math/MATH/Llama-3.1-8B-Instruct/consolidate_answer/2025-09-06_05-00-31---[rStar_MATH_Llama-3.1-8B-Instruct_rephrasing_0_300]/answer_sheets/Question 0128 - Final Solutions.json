However, as mentioned in the hint, it turns out that February does not have any multiples of 3. This means that Suzanne cannot walk on any of the days in February due to the requirement that she must walk on every third day. Thus, she won't be able to meet this condition during the entire month of February. Therefore, the minimum distance she can walk in February is 0 miles.

According to condition 1, Suzanne walks every three days. If there were exactly 28 days in February, she would walk on 9 of those days, because $28\\div3=9R1$, meaning she would walk on each of the first 27 days plus the last day. But in our scenario, we're assuming that there are 25 days in February. We need to determine her walking schedule for the month. There are seven days in a week, and since she starts walking on the fourth day, we'll calculate how many times she walks in a week. She walks four miles on the 4th day, 7th day, 10th day, etc., until she reaches day 25. To get the number of weeks, we subtract 3 from 25 and divide by 7, resulting in $22/7=3R1$. Thus, Suzanne will walk on $3\\times7=21$ of those days plus the first day, because she walks every 3rd day starting from the 4th. This means that she will walk on 22 days in February.
