After choosing the three cars to go straight, the order in which they arrive matters because it determines who is in the leftmost position, the middle position, and the rightmost position. Since there are three such positions and three choices of which car is in which position, there are $3!$ different orders in which the three straight-driving cars may arrive. Thus, the number of possible arrangements of Case 1 is $20\\times 3!=120$. Likewise, there are also $20\\times3!=120$ possible arrangements in Case 2 (where all six cars turn in the same direction). In Case 3, there are again $\\binom{6}{1}=6$ ways to pick which of the six cars will go straight and drive through the right-most lane, leaving two of the cars to go into the left-turn and right-turn lanes.
