Recall that each exterior angle of any polygon sums up to 360 degrees. For a regular polygon like the one described here, every angle has the same size. The sum of the angles in a regular polygon can be found using the formula $180(n-2)$, where n is the number of vertices. The formula is derived by calculating the total number of degrees in a full rotation around the shape and dividing by the number of angles. For instance, a square has four equal sides and thus the sum of its angles would be $\\frac{360^{\\circ}\\times 4}{4}=360^{\\circ}$, confirming the concept. In the case of a pentagon, $n=5$; therefore, the sum of its interior angles is $180(5 - 2)=180\\times 3=540$. To calculate each individual interior angle, we need to divide this total by the number of angles: $540^{\\circ}/5=108^{\\circ}$.
