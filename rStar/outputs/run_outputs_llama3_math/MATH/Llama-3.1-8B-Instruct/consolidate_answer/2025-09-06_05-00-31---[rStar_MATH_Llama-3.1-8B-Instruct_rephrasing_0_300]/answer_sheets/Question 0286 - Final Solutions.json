Condition 2: The triple (a, b, c) belongs to the set T if and only if there exists a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c. Condition 3: We want to find the summation of fractions, where each fraction is defined as $2^a / (3^b * 5^c)$. Question: What is the sum of the fractions of all (a, b, c) in T?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Is it true that a+b>c?", "subanswer": {"text": "Yes, because the sum of any two sides of a triangle must exceed the length of the third side. The answer is True.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Does there exist some upper limit to the possible values of a, b, and c?", "subanswer": {"text": "Yes, since a+b>c and all variables are positive integers, the largest possible value of c is a+b-1. The answer is a+b-1.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the sum of the fractions of all (a, b, c) in T?", "subanswer": {"text": "It follows that $S=\\sum_{a=1}^\\infty \\sum_{b=a+1}^\\infty \\sum_{c=a+b-1}^\\infty \\frac{2^a}{3^b \\cdot 5^c}$, which can be re-expressed as \\begin{align*}", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
