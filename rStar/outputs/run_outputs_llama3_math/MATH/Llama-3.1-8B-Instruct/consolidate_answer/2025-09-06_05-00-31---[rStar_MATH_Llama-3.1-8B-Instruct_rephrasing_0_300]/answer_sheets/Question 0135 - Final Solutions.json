To find the number of trailing zeroes in 42!, we need to count the number of 5's in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to 42, since each five will contribute one zero when multiplied out. We can ignore any other factor that divides 42!. Let's first count the number of multiples of 5: There are 42/5=8 multiples of 5, so that's 8 fives. But some of them contain more than one factor of 5, like 25, 30, and 35. Counting those extra fives, we get: There are 42/25=1 multiples of 25, but wait, 25 itself was counted as 5! So we've double-counted one multiple of 5. However, there are also multiples of 25*5=125 that were not counted yet, but none such occur between 1 and 42. Thus, counting only once those additional powers of 5, there are $8+1=\\boxed{9}$ total factors of 5.
