Let's evaluate f(1) and f(-1) because, according to the hint, these will give us the remainders when f(x) is divided by (x - 1) and (x + 1) respectively. Thus, f(1) = 1^10+5\\cdot1^9-8\\cdot1^8+7\\cdot1^7-1^6-12\\cdot1^5+4\\cdot1^4-8\\cdot1^3+12\\cdot1^2-5\\cdot1-5= 1+5-8+7-1-12+4-8+12-5-5=-10. Similarly, f(-1) = (-1)^10+5\\cdot(-1)^9-8\\cdot(-1)^8+7\\cdot(-1)^7-(-1)^6-12\\cdot(-1)^5+4\\cdot(-1)^4-8\\cdot(-1)^3+12\\cdot(-1)^2-5\\cdot(-1)-5= 1-5-8-7-1+12+4+8+12+5-5=", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
