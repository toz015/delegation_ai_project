Because the number of pages must be $3$ more than some multiple of $7$, we can represent it as $7k + 3$, where $k$ is a nonnegative integer. Since the number of pages is also $2l$, we can set up an equation to relate the number of leaves to $k$: $2l=7k+3$. To minimize the number of leaves while satisfying this equation, we need to choose the smallest value of $k$ such that the solution for $l$ satisfies Condition 3 ($l > 100$). The smallest possible value for $k$ would give us the least $l$. The first few multiples of $7$ when added to three exceed $100$ is for k = 15. So we have $2l = 7(15)+3=108$, giving us $l = 54$.
