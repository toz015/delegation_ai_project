First, let's analyze what information is given and what needs to be found. Two ropes, HC and HD, need to be replaced by a single rope HP, where P lies on CD. Our goal is to minimize the length of the new rope HP. We know the lengths of HC and HD, which are 150m and 130m, respectively. These two ropes form a right triangle with hypotenuse HO. Let's call the point where P touches CD as Q. Because PQ is part of HC and QD is part of HD, we can conclude that HQ^2=QD^2+PQ^2 and HP^2=HQ^2+QD^2. By simplifying these equations, we get HP=HD+PQ and HQ=PQ+QD. Now, we substitute HQ into the equation for HP: HP=HD+PQ=sqrt(QD^2+PQ^2)+PQ. To minimize HP, we must maximize PQ. From QD+PQ=CD=140, we find that QD=140-PQ.

To find the greatest length of rope that can be saved, let's denote the distance of $P$ from $C$ as $x$. The total length of rope used is therefore $130+x+150=280+x$. The original length was $150+130=\\boxed{280}$ meters, so the difference between them is $280 - (280+x)=\\boxed{-x}$. Now, since we're looking for the greatest value of this expression, it must be the minimum possible value of x. To make x small, we try to increase y, but remember that y cannot exceed 70, because C and D are separated by 140 and CD makes a right angle with OD being vertical. If you pick any other value of y between 1 and 69, you'll get a smaller value of x. Therefore, our best choice is to make y equal to 70. In this case, our final answer is simply 70 - 35 = 35.
