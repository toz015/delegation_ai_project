Using any two of the points listed in the problem, such as point P1(0,-1,-1) and P2(-4,4,4), we can plug their coordinates into the equation of the plane, obtaining two separate equations in terms of the variables A, B, C, and D: -A-D = 0 and 4A+4B+4C+D=0. From here, we can solve the system of equations to eliminate D and solve for the remaining variables. First, solving -A - D = 0 for D, we find that D = -A. Plugging D=-A into the second equation 4A + 4B + 4C + D = 0, we have 4A+4B+4C-A=0. Rearranging this equation gives us 3A+4B+4C=0. At this point, we can apply the condition that the coefficients have no common factors other than 1, which means that we cannot divide through by any coefficient. We can also use the fact that the largest coefficient in the equation is A=1. Therefore, our next step involves making sure that the other coefficients (B and C) are as simple as possible while still satisfying the equation. One way to ensure this is by trial-and-error, where we try various combinations of positive integer coefficients until we find a solution for B and C that is acceptable. In this case, we will simplify B = (B, -B) and C = (C, -C). So we must find integer solutions to this equation such that A=1. Because we require that the coefficients A, B, and C have no common factors, we will test different values for them to satisfy the equation. Upon performing a few iterations, we find that if we let B=1 and C=2, we can create an equation where A+B+C = 0, B = 1, C = 2 and finally D = -A = -1.
