To calculate the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even, we need to consider whether the two people chose two odd numbers or two even numbers since any two odd numbers add up to an even number, as do any two even numbers. If they both pick 2, then it doesn't matter what order they picked them in - the sum would still be even. There are $\\binom62=15$ ways to choose two different numbers from the set of six primes. Of these combinations, there are $\\binom52=10$ combinations where both primes are even (there are only two even primes in our list). Now, let's count how many combinations there are where Paul and Jesse chose two odd numbers. In order to choose two odd numbers from the set of six primes, we can use $\\binom6c2$, where c denotes odd prime numbers.

To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even, we need to consider all possible combinations of two numbers chosen from the first six primes: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}. If both numbers chosen are odd, then their sum is even; otherwise, it is odd. There are four odd prime numbers out of the six primes given (3, 5, 7, 11). The probability that Paul chooses an odd prime is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3. Similarly, the probability that Jesse also chooses an odd prime is 2/3. Since these events are independent, we multiply these probabilities together: $(2/3)\\cdot(2/3)=4/9$. Now we must add the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose even numbers, i.e., 1/3*1/3=1/9, since the event that both choose an even number is mutually exclusive of them both choosing an odd number.
