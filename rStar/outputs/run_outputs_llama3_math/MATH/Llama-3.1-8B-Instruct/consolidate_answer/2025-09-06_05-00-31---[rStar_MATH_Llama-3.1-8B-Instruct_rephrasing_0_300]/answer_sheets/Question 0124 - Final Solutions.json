To solve the equation $|x+5|-|3x-6|=0$, we consider the following three cases:\n\nCase 1: Assume both expressions inside each absolute value bar are non-negative.\nThis leads to the equation: $(x+5)-(3x-6)=0\\Rightarrow-2x+11=0\\Rightarrow\\boxed{x=\\frac{11}{2}}.$\n\nCase 2: Assume both expressions inside each absolute value bar are negative.\nThis leads to the equation: $-(x+5)-(-3x+6)=0\\Rightarrow-2x-19=0\\Rightarrow\\boxed{x=-\\frac{19}{2}}.$\n\nCase 3: Assume one expression inside each absolute value bar is positive and the other is negative.\nThere are two possibilities here:\n\nPossibility 1: We assume $x+5\\geq0$ but $3x-6<0$.\nThis implies that $x\\geq-5$ but $x<2$.
