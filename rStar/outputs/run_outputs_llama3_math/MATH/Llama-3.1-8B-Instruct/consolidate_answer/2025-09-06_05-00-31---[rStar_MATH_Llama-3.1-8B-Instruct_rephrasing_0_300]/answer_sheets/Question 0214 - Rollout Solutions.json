By the information given, we know that $C=180,H=2P,P=H+30,C-P=H-P=75$. From the last equation, we have $P=C-H$. Substituting the expression of $H$ into the equation, we have $P=180-2P$, which leads to $3P=180$ and hence $P=60$. Therefore, the answer is $P=60$.

To solve the problem, we first use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to write the number of students taking calculus, physics, or chemistry in terms of the sizes of various intersections: $$|C \\cup P \\cup Ch| = |P| + |Ch| + |C| - |P \\cap C| - |P \\cap Ch| - |Ch| + |P \\cap C \\cap Ch|$$ where $|P \\cap C \\cap Ch| = 15,$ and we are solving for $|P|$. Substituting in our previously found expressions for $|P|, |Ch|, |C|,$ and $|P \\cap Ch|,$ we get: \\begin{align*}\n    |C \\cup P \\cup Ch| &= k + 2k + 180 - (30 + 75) - (3k - 30) + 15\\\\\n    &=(2k)+(k)+180-(105)-(3k+30)+15\\\\\n    &=120-k.\n\\end{align*}Since $|C \\cup P \\cup Ch| = 360 - |(C \\cup P \\cup Ch)^c|", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
