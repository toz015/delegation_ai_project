However, angles C and B form a straight line, making their total sum 180 degrees. If we let angle B be b, we get that b+7=180; hence, b=173. Alternatively, if we let angle C be c, we get that 2c+b=180; hence, 2c+b=180 and 2(7)+b=180, implying that b=165. This reasoning leads to incorrect answers; we cannot conclude that angle A is double angle C because there could be multiple other angles D such that angles A, B, and D form a straight line. Therefore, we cannot determine that angle A is double angle C using the information provided. Instead, we need to use the Inscribed Angles Theorem, which states that an angle formed by two chords in a circle must have its measure equal to half the measure of the arc intercepted by those chords. Here, side AB forms chord AB. In the following figure, the measures of arcs AC and BC correspond to the measures of angles C and B, respectively, where these angles are formed by the intersection of a transversal with two parallel lines (the radii), while arcs AC and BC themselves are segments on the same circle. Therefore, the Inscribed Angles Theorem tells us that the measures of angles C and B must equal the corresponding measures of arcs AC and BC. Furthermore, we know that arcs AD and CD together form a semicircle, with a measure of 180 degrees. Arc AC corresponds to a portion of arc AD whose measure is the same as the measure of angle C. Similarly, arc BD corresponds to a portion of arc DC whose measure is the same as the measure of angle B.

Consequently, arcs AC and BD together have the same measure as arcs CD and AD. Therefore, arcs AC and BD have the same measure as arcs AD and CD, meaning arc BC also has a measure of 180-angle B.
