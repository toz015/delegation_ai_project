The first thing to consider here is what happens when Bob picks the original ball. If Bob were to pick the exact original ball, the distribution of the balls would be the same as before. However, since this isn't allowed according to the problem conditions, we need to disregard this possibility altogether. Now let's look at the other possibilities. There are four possible ways in which Alice could draw the original ball and Bob could put it in his own bag. Let's say the original ball was blue. If Alice draws the blue, she puts it in Bob's bag. When Bob goes to choose a ball from his bag, he can either choose a different colored ball, which would leave one blue and five other balls in both bags; or he can choose the other blue, which wouldn't change anything. But we've already ruled out the possibility that he picks the original blue because that changes nothing. Therefore we're left with only one way things could happen with respect to the original blue ball - he gets a different ball, leaving him with five choices to get the same amount of any color other than blue as well.
