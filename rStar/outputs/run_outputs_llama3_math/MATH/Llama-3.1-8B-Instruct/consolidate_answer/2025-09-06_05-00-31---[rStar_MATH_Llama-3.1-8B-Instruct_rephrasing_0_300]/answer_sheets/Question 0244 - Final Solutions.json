A key property of polygons is that the sum of the measures of the interior angles can be found using the formula $S=(n-2)\\cdot180$, where $S$ is the sum of the interior angles and $n$ is the number of sides. To understand why this formula works, consider starting with a triangle. A triangle has three sides and three angles. As you add more sides to form larger polygons, each new angle adds $60^\\circ$ to the total sum because the sum of the measures of the interior angles increases by $60^\\circ$ for every additional side added beyond the initial three sides. Thus, the total increase is $(n-2) \\times 60^\\circ = 180(n - 2)^\\circ$, since each time you add a side, the increase becomes one degree less due to the way degrees work when adding up.
