We need to break the problem into cases based on what surfaces the gecko uses to travel between points A and B, because we know the gecko will stay on either the ceiling or one of the four walls during the entire journey. If the gecko walks along the ceiling to reach the back wall, then turns right onto the wall and proceeds to the front wall, then it turns left onto the ceiling again to reach the target location; if it goes the other way around (i.e., left on the ceiling, right on the wall, right on the ceiling), then it would walk the same amount of horizontal distance but travel more vertical distance, so we'll just consider those two possibilities. There are six other possible paths that involve turning onto the ceiling twice, going three sides, and going two ceilings and three sides. For each such possibility, let us calculate how much the gecko travels along the horizontal axis and how much the gecko travels along the vertical axis. Note that the horizontal distance traveled is always $6$ regardless of which direction the gecko travels, while the vertical distance traveled differs depending on the order of travel as follows:\n\n*   Ceiling-to-Wall-to-Ceiling-to-Wall: $8 - 7", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
