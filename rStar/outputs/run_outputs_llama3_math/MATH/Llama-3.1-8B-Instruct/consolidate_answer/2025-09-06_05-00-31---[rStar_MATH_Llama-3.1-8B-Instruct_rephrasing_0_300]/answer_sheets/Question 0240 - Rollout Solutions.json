Let's start by looking at the angles involved. There are three angles: \u2220PQT, \u2220QTR, and \u2220PQR. Because the lines PT and QR are parallel, corresponding angles have equal measures. Therefore, \u2220PQT = \u2220QTR. From Condition 3, we also know that \u2220PQT = \u2220PQR. Now we need to figure out what \u2220QTR measures. To do that, we look at the equation 2x + x = 180. Combining like terms yields 3x = 180. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x = 60. Since \u2220QTR measures the same as \u2220PQR, and \u2220PQR is an exterior angle of triangle PRQ, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 to find the value of \u2220PQR. That would be 180 - 60 - 60 = 60. Therefore, the measure of angle PQR, in degrees, is $\\boxed{60}.$ The answer is: 60.  \n\nThis solution was generated through a combination of human insight and artificial intelligence.
