If there are 12 books in the bookcase, how many books remain empty? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Each shelf holds 5 books. There are 3 shelves, so in total, the bookshelf holds 3 * 5 = 15 books. Step 2: However, there are only 12 books. Step 3: Therefore, there are 15 - 12 = 3 books left over. Step 4: The answer is: 3.  ### Instruction: Two pipes are connected between two tanks as shown below. Each pipe can fill one tank completely in 16 hours, and the other in 24 hours. Tank B is initially full. Determine how long it would take to drain tank B completely, assuming both pipes work simultaneously when they drain water into tank A. ### Response: Let's think step by step.
