First, let's calculate the areas of each region, starting with the largest one. The area of a circle is given by the formula $\\pi r^2$, so for the large outermost circle, with radius 7, its area is $A_{outer}= \\pi * 7 ^2= 49 \\pi$. For the middle circle, with radius 6, its area is $A_{middle} = \\pi * 6 ^2=36 \\pi$. Lastly, the innermost circle, with radius 4, its area is $A_{inner} = \\pi * 4 ^2=16 \\pi$. So now we know the areas of each region.
