Question: What is the probability that the chosen points all lie on the same straight line?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How many ways can you pick three distinct points from the nine points available on the grid such that they lie on the same straight line?", "subanswer": {"text": "These would include choosing the bottom left points, middle left points or top left points, so there are 3 ways to pick three distinct points from the leftmost column, similarly 3 ways to pick three distinct points from the middle column and 3 ways to pick three distinct points from the rightmost column. Then there are 3 rows, so there are a total of 3+3+3+3+3+3 =18 ways to pick three distinct points that lie on the same row or column. There are also three ways to choose three points on the main diagonal. Hence, there are $\\boxed{21}$ ways to choose three distinct points such that they lie on the same line. The answer is 21.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that the chosen points all lie on the same straight line?", "subanswer": {"text": "The probability of getting three points which lie on a straight line is $\\frac{21}{84} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$. The answer is $\\frac{1}{4}$.", "value": 0.6875}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
