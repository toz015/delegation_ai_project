But we want a whole number for n so let\u2019s try another approach. In order to have three types of squares (that is, 1x1, 2x2 and 3x3 squares), we need at least 4 rows of squares. Since we know that the smallest possible size of n is 4, we can assume that $n\\geq 4$ is true. By trying n = 5, we see that we get more than 70 squares. Hence, our assumption must be false, meaning $n<5$. Also, since $n>2$, we conclude that $3<n<5$. Trying n = 4 doesn\u2019t satisfy the condition either, but n = 3 does not give a 3x3 square either. However, there are actually 70 squares when n is slightly less than 5, such as 4.6667. Since trying again and getting a fraction is  3, we conclude that $n=5$ isn't a good solution, hence we'll solve for $n$ using a calculator and guess-and-check method. Our goal is to find a value of $n$ that makes the statement true and also satisfies $3<n<5$. It turns out that if $n=5$, the number of squares exceeds 70.
