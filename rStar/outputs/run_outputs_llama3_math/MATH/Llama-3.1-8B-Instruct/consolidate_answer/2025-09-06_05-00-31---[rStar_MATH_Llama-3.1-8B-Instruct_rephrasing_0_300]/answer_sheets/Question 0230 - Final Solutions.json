It follows that we cannot actually achieve this maximum value (of $e = -2$), and hence $e > -2.$ In order to find the minimum possible value of $e$, note that $e$ will definitely be less than or equal to zero; this is true as long as $a+b+c+d>0$. Then, if $a=b=c=d>0$, then we see that $a+b+c+d>0$, implying that $e<0.$ On the other hand, if any of $a,b,c,d$ were negative, then $a+b+c+d$ would be even more positive, again implying that $e<0.$ Hence, for all four of $a,b,c,d$ to be at their maximum, they must all be greater than zero, which means that either all are less than or equal to zero, or none are. Now let us analyze what happens when all the $a,b,c,d$ are nonnegative. This means that $$a+b+c+d+e=8$$implies that $$e=8-a-b-c-d.$$Since $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2=16$, we have that $$a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+(8-a-b-c-d)^2=16$$which simplifies to $$(a-b)^2+(a-c)^2+(a-d)^2-8(a+b+c+d)+32=0.$$We wish to minimize $a+b+c+d$; clearly, this quantity is minimized when $a=b=c=d=0$, so we should substitute in", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the maximum value of variable $e$?", "subanswer": {"text": "Letting $a=b=c=d=0$ implies that $e=8$, and since we previously showed that $e>-2$, we conclude that the maximum value of $e$ is indeed $8$.
