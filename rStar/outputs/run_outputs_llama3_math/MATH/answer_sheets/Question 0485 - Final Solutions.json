To determine the shortest path that travels through each vertex exactly once, we can consider different routes such as ABCD or DCBA. However, as hinted in the solution, neither of these paths results in the shortest total distance. Instead, we need to find a different path. One way to do this is to look for a Hamiltonian cycle - a closed loop that visits every vertex exactly once before returning to the starting point. Upon inspection, it appears that vertices B, C, D, and A could form a valid Hamiltonian cycle with no backtracking, namely, BCDAB or BCADB does not work, but BADC works.
