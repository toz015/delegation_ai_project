We are given the equation of a curve as $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)$ and asked to find the square of the distance from the origin to any point $(x, y)$ on the curve. To find this, we need to use the distance formula from the origin. By squaring both sides of the distance formula $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$, we get: $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Substituting the value of $y$ obtained from the equation of the curve into the squared distance formula: $d^2 = x^2 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3))^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + 9$.

To find the distance from the origin to any point $(x,y)$ on the curve, we take the square root of the squared distance.

Therefore, we set $x^3-6x=0,$ and factoring out $x$ gives $x(x^2-6)=0.$ We know that $x\\neq 0,$ since distance cannot be zero, so we have $x^2-6=0,$ giving $x^2=6.$ Taking the square root of both sides yields $x=\\pm\\sqrt{6},$ but we discard the negative solution because it corresponds to the wrong sign for the square root.
