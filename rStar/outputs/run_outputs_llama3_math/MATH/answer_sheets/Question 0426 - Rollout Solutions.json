We know that the perimeter of the triangle is $24$, and since it also equals the perimeter of the square, each side of the square must be $\\frac{24}{4}=6$ cm. Thus, we want the length of the diagonal of a $6\\times6$ square. By Pythagoras' theorem, we know that a diagonal of a square of side-length $s$ is equal to $\\sqrt{2}s$; therefore, our answer is $\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{2}}$ cm. The answer is: 6\\sqrt{2}.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
