To calculate the number of representatives each grade should have, we need to figure out the fraction of the total number of students that each grade makes up. In order to do so, we first calculate the total number of students. Total number of students equals 520 + 650 = 1170. Now, let's determine what fraction of the total the 8th grade represents. This can be calculated as follows: Fraction of total represented by 8th grade = 650 / 1170 = 65/117 = 13/23.33. The next step involves multiplying the fraction found above by the total number of student council representatives. Number of representatives each grade should have = 18 * (13/23.33). Solving this equation will give us the desired outcome. First, let's evaluate 18 * 13 = 234. Next, divide 234 by 23.33. Performing the division yields 10.02.
