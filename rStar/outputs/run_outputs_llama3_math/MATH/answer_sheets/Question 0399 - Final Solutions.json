Now we can rewrite our original problem as $313 + .9 + 12.6$. But before we can add .9 and 12.6, we need to combine them into one number. Notice that both numbers can be expressed as a whole number and a decimal. That is, $12.6=12+.6$, so $.9+12.6=.9+12+.6$. Now, let's use the associative property to group these terms together in pairs that are easy to add: $(.9+.6)+12=(.9+0.6)+12=1.5+12=13.5.$ Finally, we can add this number to 313 to get our final answer: $313 + 13.5 = 326.5$.
