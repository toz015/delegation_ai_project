Now, let's consider the hybrid car which averages 48 miles per gallon. We need to calculate how much gas she would have used while driving it for the same distance. We use division to solve for the unknown quantity in this problem. Using the formula $distance=gallons\\times mpg$, where distance is 12,000 miles and mpg is 48, we get $gallons=\\frac{12,000}{48}=250.$ Subtracting the amount of gas used by the hybrid car (250 gallons) from the amount used by the SUV (800 gallons) yields the amount of gasoline saved: $800-250=\\boxed{550}$ gallons.

To determine how much gasoline Karla saved, we need to calculate how much gasoline she would use if she drives the hybrid versus the SUV. Let's first consider what she would spend if she was driving the SUV. According to condition 3, the SUV gets 15 miles per gallon. Given that she traveled a total of 12,000 miles, we calculate the amount of gasoline she would use as follows: Total Gas Used with SUV = Total Miles / MPG of SUV = 12,000 / 15 \u2248 800 gallons. Now let's calculate how much gasoline she would use if she were driving the hybrid car. From condition 3 again, it gets 48 miles per gallon. Using similar reasoning as above, Total Gas Used with Hybrid = Total Miles / MPG of Hybrid = 12,000 / 48 \u2248 250 gallons. The difference in the amount of gasoline used with each type of vehicle represents the savings Karla experiences: Savings = Total Gas Used with SUV - Total Gas Used with Hybrid = 800 - 250 = 550 gallons.
