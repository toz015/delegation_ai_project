In order for Brahmagupta to maximize $z,$ he must choose $y$ so that it satisfies the equation $$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}=0.$$To see why this is the case, let's use the concept of directional derivatives, which will help us understand how the value of a function changes when one of its variables changes. A directional derivative measures the rate at which a function changes along a particular direction. For any function f(x) with respect to y, we know that f'(y) represents its instantaneous rate of change. Therefore, the value of a function is maximized or minimized when its instantaneous rate of change equals zero. In other words, when the slope of a tangent line at a point is zero, the function has reached its maximum or minimum value. Now, going back to our problem, we want to maximize the value of the function z with respect to y. To do this, we need to take the partial derivative of z with respect to y, set it equal to zero, and solve for y. Let's compute the partial derivative of z with respect to y.

As such, if $x$ were a free variable, then Brahmagupta could choose $y$ to be the solution to this equation for every possible value of $x$, but since $x$ is being chosen by Archimedes, Brahmagupta cannot choose $y$. However, we are interested in finding the optimal strategy for Brahmagupta to maximize $z$, not the values of $y$.

To minimize $z$, we want the term $(2x-y)^2$ to be as small as possible. However, we also know that $y$ is chosen second and Archimedes wants to minimize $z$. To do so, he needs to make sure that when $Brahmagupta$ chooses $y$, the overall $z$ does not increase. Thus, he wants to try to keep the overall coefficient of $y$ equal to zero.
