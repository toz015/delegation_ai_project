By Vieta's formulas, $r_1+r_2=a$ and $r_1 r_2=b$. We know that $c^2 - 2$ is a root of the given equation. Therefore, we have $$c^2-2=r_1r_2/b.$$ This simplifies to$$c^2-2=ba.$$Since this holds true for every root, we must have $$(r_1+r_2)^2\\le c^2-2=b+2\\Rightarrow a^2\\le ba+2.$$Therefore, we must have either $a\\le-\\sqrt{b}$ or $a\\ge\\sqrt{b}$. It follows that $a^2-b\\le a(a-2).$ The only way that $a^2-b\\ge a(a-2)$ is if $a^2\\le a^2-2a$, which implies $2a\\le 0$, a contradiction since $a$ cannot equal negative infinity and must therefore be nonnegative. Thus, we conclude that $a^2-b<a(a-2)\\Rightarrow a<\\frac{-b}{2},$$from which we deduce that $a<-\\sqrt{b}/2$ because $b>-a^2/2$, which follows from our assumption about $a$. Note that $-\\sqrt{b}/2>0$ is not valid; therefore, $a\\ge \\sqrt{b}$. In addition, note that we cannot have equality in this case. However, we do not need to consider equality. If we assume that $a\\ge\\sqrt{b}\\neq 0$, then $c^2-2=b/(r_1 r_2)=b/a,$ or $c^2-(b/a)+2=0$. But since the discriminant of this quadratic equation would be $b^2/a^2-8a$, we see that the value of $b^2-a^2$ does not matter as long as $b\\neq 0$. However, $a\\neq 0$ so the constant term of this quadratic equation is never zero.

We know that $a\\ge \\sqrt{b}.$ Moreover, since $b\\neq 0,$ we have that $a^2>b.$ Also, recall that the sum of squares of two real numbers cannot be less than the square of their sum. Therefore, we must have that $a^2\\ge (r_1r_2)/(c^2-2)=a/(c^2-b/a),$ implying that $$a^2(c^2-b/a)\\ge ac^2.$$ We know that $a\\ge \\sqrt{b}>0$; hence, it follows that $$ac^2\\ge a^2c^2-bc^2.$$ Dividing both sides of the inequality by $bc^2$ yields $$(c^2/b)(a/b)\\ge (ac^2)/bc^2+1\\Rightarrow c^2/b\\ge a/b+1.$$ Multiplying through by $b$ gives us $c^2\\ge ab+b$, or $ab-c^2+b\\le 0$.
