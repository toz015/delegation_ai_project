No, because when you add the whole parts together (13 + 300 = 313), it doesn't equal 326 (which is 313.9 + 12.6). However, we can still add the whole part of 12.6 to 300, then add .9 and .6 separately. Adding the whole parts gives us 313. Now let's consider the decimals. To make the decimals easier to work with, we'll express them as fractions: $0.9=\\frac{9}{10}$ and $0.6=\\frac{3}{5}$. Since both denominators don't have common factors other than 1, we need to convert the second fraction to one with a denominator of 10. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 2 gives us the equivalent fraction $0.6=6/10$. Now we can just add these fractions together: $0.9+0.6=9/10+6/10=15/10=1.5$, which in decimal form is 1.5. Adding 1.5 to our previous answer of 313 yields $313+1.5=\\boxed{314.5}$.
