To reflect the point $(0,0)$ over the line $x=1$, we need to draw a perpendicular line to the line $x=1$ passing through the point $(0,0)$. The equation of the line $x=1$ is already in slope-intercept form, so it has a slope of zero. The slope of any line perpendicular to this would be undefined (vertical). Thus, the perpendicular line has an equation of the form $x=a$. Since it also passes through $(0,0)$, we know that $a=0$. Therefore, the perpendicular line has an equation of $x=0$ and reflects the point $(0,0)$ onto itself because a vertical line doesn't change x-coordinate when it intersects. The image of the point $(0,0)$ is still $(0,0)$. Now let's consider the second reflection. When a point $(x,y)$ undergoes a reflection over a horizontal line $y=b$, its y-coordinate gets mapped to $b - (b-y) = b - y$, since this value would be $b$ units above or below $y$, depending on whether $b>y$ or $b<y$.
