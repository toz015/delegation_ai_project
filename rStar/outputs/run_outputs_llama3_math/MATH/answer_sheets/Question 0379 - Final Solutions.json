Similarly, the percentage of female riders on buses that 10th graders take is 0.331 * 100 = 33.1%. Then divide .335 by .331 to get 1.0124, meaning the number of male bus riders for 10th graders is greater than 1.35 * the number of female bus riders.

Similarly, for 10th grade, the difference is $44.56-34.4=10.16\\%$, for 11th grade, it is $26.19-20.6=5.59\\%$, and finally, for 12th grade, the difference is $16.32-11.6=4.72\\%$. Comparing the differences we obtained, we see that the 12th grade has the lowest difference, which is $4.72\\%$.
