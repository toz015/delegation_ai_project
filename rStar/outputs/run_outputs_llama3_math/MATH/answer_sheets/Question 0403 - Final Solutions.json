It follows that if any digit other than the rightmost digit occurs twice in either the base 7 or base 8 expansions, then they occur twice in the base 8 expansion.  By symmetry, this implies that they also occur twice in the base 7 expansion.  But since we know this cannot happen, none of the middle digits of our numbers occurs twice.

Dividing $271$ by $343$ we get $0$ with a remainder of $-72$, but since we're dealing with remainders, let's take the positive value which is equal to $271 - 343 = -72 + 448 = 376$ divided by $448$ gives $0$ with a remainder of $269$. Again, dividing $269$ by $448$ we get $0$ with a remainder of $-179$. Taking the positive value we get $269 - 448 = -179 + 448 = 269$.
