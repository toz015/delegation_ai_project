The centroid G of triangle ABC is the average of its three vertices: G\\left(\\dfrac{x_A+x_B+x_C}{3}, \\dfrac{y_A+y_B+y_C}{3}\\right). The coordinates of the orthocenter H are the average of the coordinates of its three vertices A, B, and C. The equation of the altitude from vertex A to side BC is y - y_A = -\\dfrac{b}{a}(x - x_A), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle opposite to vertices A, B, and C. Similarly, we obtain equations for the altitudes from vertices B and C to sides AC and AB, respectively. By solving these three linear equations, we can express the coordinates of H as the average of the coordinates of its three vertices A, B, and C: H\\left(\\dfrac{x_A+x_B+x_C}{3}, \\dfrac{y_A+y_B+y_C}{3}\\right).

The centroid of a triangle can be found using the formula $\\left(\\dfrac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3},\\dfrac{y_1+y_2+y_3}{3}\\right)$, where $\\left(x_1,y_1\\right),\\,\\left(x_2,y_2\\right),$and $\\left(x_3,y_3\\right)$ are the coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle. The circumcenter (or circumcircle center) of a triangle is equidistant to the three vertices. In particular, it lies on the perpendicular bisector of each side. The circumcenter also equals the intersection of the angle bisectors of the three angles. It\u2019s worth noting that the circumcenter and the incenter do not necessarily coincide.
