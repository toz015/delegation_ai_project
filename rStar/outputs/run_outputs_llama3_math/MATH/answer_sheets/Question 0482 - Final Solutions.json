The answer is If an odd integer is divisible only by 3 and/or 5, it must have terminating decimal as its reciprocal because the denominator 1/n has a factor of 3 or 5 (or both).", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "How many odd numbers less than 2010 are divisible only by 3 and/or 5?", "subanswer": {"text": "First, let's consider how many odd multiples of 3 there are. There are \\lfloor \\frac{2008}{6}\\rfloor =333. Then we count the odd multiples of 15. However, some were already counted so we need to subtract them to avoid double-counting. Thus, there are  \\lfloor \\frac{2008}{30} \\rfloor=66 , which means 3* 67=201 . Additionally, we have to take into account the fact that some numbers were overcounted. Therefore, the total number of such numbers is 333+66-67=332. Similarly, there are \\lfloor \\frac{2008}{10}\\rfloor=200 odd multiples of 5 that don't meet our criteria but we have overcounted. We have counted every other multiple of 25 which equals to $$\\frac{2008}{50}=40$$,  therefore, we have to remove this amount once. So the amount of numbers meeting our requirements is $332+200-40=492$. The answer is 492.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}, "3": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected odd integer yields a terminating decimal?", "subanswer": {"text": "To calculate the probability, divide the numerator by the denominator:  $\\frac{492}{1004}$ reduces to $$\\frac{123}{251}.$$ Therefore, a=123 and b=251.
