We now factor by finding combinations of coefficients whose sum equals the constant term (in this case, -23) and whose products equal the coefficient of the highest degree term. By inspection, we see that the factors could be (x-1) and (x^3+6x^2+11x+23). Factoring them together we get: (x-1)(x^3+6x^2+11x+23). So, now we know that either (x-1)=0 or (x^3+6x^2+11x+23)=0. From the first factor, we can tell that one solution is x=1. Next, consider the cubic equation x^3+6x^2+11x+23. We know that any rational solution p/q satisfies V(p,q)=V(f(p)), where f(x) is the cubic equation. We also know that if p and q are integers, then V(p,q) is the greatest common divisor of p and q. Furthermore, V(a,b,c,d)=V(a-c,a-d,b,c,d)=V(b-a,b-d,a,c,d)=V(b,a,c-a,c-d,d), where a, b, c, d are constants. Here, V(1,1) = V(1,24,35,46) = V(24,-23) = V", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
