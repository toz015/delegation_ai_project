To perform the desired transformation, let us first find the line onto which our reflection operation occurs. The midpoint of the original vector and its reflection over the desired line is equidistant to both, so it lies along the line. The midpoint of the vectors is $\\begin{pmatrix} 4.5 \\\\ 1.5 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of the segment connecting the vectors is $m=\\frac{3-0}{4-5}=-3$. Using this information, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is therefore $$y-1.5=3(x-4.5)\\Rightarrow y=3x-10.5.$$ However, because it is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the vectors, it also contains their midpoint. Thus, we know that $(4.5,1.5)$ satisfies the line\u2019s equation; thus, the line works as we wanted. Now that we know what the line is, we simply use the fact that the line is the perpendicular bisector to calculate the reflection of any vector that intersects the line.

A reflection over a line passing through the midpoint of two points maps one point onto the other.
