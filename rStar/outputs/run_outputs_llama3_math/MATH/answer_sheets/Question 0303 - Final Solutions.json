Given condition 2, let point E denote the intersection between line AC and line BD, so line BE and line CE are also medians of triangle ABD and triangle ACD, respectively. Based on the information provided, triangles ADC and ACE share common base AC. Because ACE is similar to triangle ADC due to the AA similarity criterion, it follows that ACE is also a right triangle, and therefore m\u2220EAC=90 degrees. This implies that triangle ADE is similar to triangle BDE, making them congruent since they share equal sides AD and DE. Likewise, based on the AA similarity criterion, ACE is also similar to AED, but now using shared side AE and equality of corresponding angles AED and AEC, respectively, we conclude that these triangles are also similar. As a consequence of triangle similarities established earlier, it turns out that triangles ADE, BDE, ACE, and AED are similar. Triangle ADE shares the same height as the trapezoid due to shared side AC and base ED, making its altitude equal to its respective height of the trapezoid, denoted h.

Therefore, we may use the Pythagorean theorem to express BD as a function of a and b: $BD^2=a^2+b^2.$ However, we also know that BD is half of AB because line segment AC bisects angle BAD.
