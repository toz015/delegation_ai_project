If $8$ and $p$ share a common factor other than 1, it means they share a common divisor other than 1. Thus, $p$ can only be $2$, since this is the only non-trivial divisor of 8 that could also be prime. So our task now is to verify that 2 really works and that no higher primes work.\n\nFor 2, note that as $2$ divides $8,$ we cannot have $8^{-1}\\pmod{2}$ defined.

By definition, we know that every odd prime is relatively prime to $8$, so for each such prime $p$, we need to solve the linear congruence $8x \\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$. To do this, note that since $gcd(8,p)=1,$ it follows that there exists an integer $a$ such that $8a + py = 1.$ This implies that $p|y,$ hence we may assume that $y=pb$ for some integer $b.$ Substituting into the previous equation gives $8a + p^2b = 1.$ Then, $pb=1 - 8a$ and since $p$ divides both sides of the equation, we see that either $p=1$ or $p|8a,$ but since $a$ is an arbitrary integer, this tells us that $p$ does not divide $8$ since 8 is relatively prime to any odd number. Hence, we deduce that $8a$ is not divisible by $p$.

A key insight here is recognizing that the non-existence of a modular inverse for $8x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ implies that $p$ shares a factor with $8$, which is $2^3$. Thus, if $p$ is not divisible by $2$, it cannot fail to have a modular inverse. Therefore, for the congruence to have no solution, $p$ **must** be divisible by $2$. Furthermore, for the congruence to not have a solution, $p$ must also be odd, because otherwise, the condition would always hold. Combining these two facts together, we see that all primes $p$ that do not satisfy the condition must be multiples of $2$ but not multiples of higher powers of $2$. Hence, we conclude that $p$ must be $2$, since $2$ is the only even prime number. Consequently, the desired sum is simply $2$. The answer is: 2. The answer is: 2. The answer is: 2. The answer is: 2.
