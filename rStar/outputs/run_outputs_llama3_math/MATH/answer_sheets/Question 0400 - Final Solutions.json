Let's analyze the information provided in the problem statement. According to Condition 2, the two smaller areas are formed around point Q by drawing tangents to the circle centered at Q. This implies that these tangents form right angles with the radius of the circle, as tangent lines always form right angles with the radius of a circle. Additionally, according to Condition 3, the radius of the larger circle with its center at Q is 14 inches. As hinted in the solution guide, since radii AQ and BQ meet at a right angle, they form a square with each side length being 14 inches. Furthermore, to get to the radius of the inner circle, we need to look at half the side of the square.
