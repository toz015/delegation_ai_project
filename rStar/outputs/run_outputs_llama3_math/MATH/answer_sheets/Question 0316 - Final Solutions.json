To solve this problem, we need to expand the right-hand side and set it equal to $10x^2-x-24$. Expanding the right-hand side yields $$(Ax-8)(Bx+3)=ABx^2+3Ax-8Bx-24$$We now want the coefficients of each term to be equal to those of the left-hand side. Therefore, the coefficient of $x^2$, $AB$, is equal to the coefficient of $x^2$ in the left-hand side, so $AB=10$. Also, the coefficient of $x$, $3A-8B$, is equal to the coefficient of $x$ in the left-hand side, so $3A-8B=-1$. Finally, the constant term, $-24$, is equal to the constant term in the left-hand side, so $-8B=-24$; thus, $B=3$.

From $-8B=-24$, we know that $B=3$. Therefore, $AB=10$, which implies that $A=10/3$. Thus, we see that our previous attempt failed because we didn't use the information that $A$ and $B$ are integers correctly. Looking back at our equation $3A-8B=-1$, we can plug in $B=3$ to get $3A-8(3)=-1$. This simplifies to $3A-24=-1$. Adding 24 to both sides gives $3A=23$. Then, dividing both sides by 3 (since we know that $A$ must be an integer), we get $A=23/3$, which doesn't make sense since $A$ is supposed to be an integer! So we made another mistake earlier. Instead, let's rewrite the equation from Step 5.2 as $$A(3)-8(3)=-1.$$Plugging in $B=3$, we know that the coefficient $-24$ will be multiplied by some integer. Since $-24$ is already a multiple of 3, we can multiply the entire equation by -1 to simplify things. After doing this, we have $-(3A)+24=1$. Next, adding 3A to both sides of the equation yields $24=3A+1$. Subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation gives us $23=3A$. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get $A=\\frac{23}{3}$, which is still not what we wanted. It seems like no matter what we try, we always get fractions instead of integers for $A$ or $B$. But remember that we just got done saying that $AB=10$. Multiplying the top and bottom of the fraction $\\frac{23}{3}$ by $10$ to eliminate the decimal, we get $\\frac{230}{30}$. Simplifying the fraction yields $\\frac{23}{3}=\\frac{230}{30}=\\frac{23}{3}$, but that\u2019s still a fraction. To get rid of the fraction, we could simply cross-multiply to get $23*3=30*A$, giving us $69=30*A$.
