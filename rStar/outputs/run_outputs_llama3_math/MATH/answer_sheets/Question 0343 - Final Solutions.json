When creating the license plate, we need to consider the choices for each position separately. Choosing the first letter can be done in 26 ways since there are 26 options for it. After selecting the first letter, there are 25 options left for the second letter. Similarly, for the two digits, there are 10 ways to select the first digit, and then 9 options for the second digit. Therefore, the total number of license plates that can be formed is calculated as follows: $(26)(25)(10)(9)=\\boxed{58500}$.
