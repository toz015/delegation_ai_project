To find this, we need to use the distance formula from the origin. By squaring both sides of the distance formula $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$, we get: $d^2 = x^2 + y^2$. Substituting the value of $y$ obtained from the equation of the curve into the squared distance formula: $d^2 = x^2 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3))^2 = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + 9$. Therefore, the square of the distance from the origin to any point $(x, y)$ on the curve is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + 9}$.

The derivative of $d^2$ with respect to $x$ is given by $\\frac{d(d^2)}{dx} = x^3 - 6x$. Setting this equal to zero yields the critical point $x^3 - 6x = 0,$ or equivalently, $x(x^2 - 6) = 0,$ so $x=0, x=\\pm \\sqrt{6}.$ Taking the second derivative of $d^2$ with respect to $x$, which is $\\frac{d^2(d^2)}{dx^2} = 3x^2 - 6,$ we see that at $x=-\\sqrt{6},$ the second derivative is negative, indicating a local maximum; at $x=+\\sqrt{6},$ the second derivative is positive, indicating a local minimum. Since we know that the global minimum occurs at either a critical point or endpoint of the domain, since our domain is unbounded but in real life is bounded, the only remaining critical point that could give a minimum is the other critical point at $x=0$ . We have $d^2(0)=9$, so the minimum distance from the origin to any point on the curve is $\\sqrt{9}=\\boxed{3}$. The answer is 3.", "value": 0.125}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
