Suppose that $P(x)$ has remainder $R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 1)(x - 4),$ and remainder $2R(x)$ when it is divided by $(x - 2)(x - 3).$  Given that $P(0) = 5,$ find $P(5).$", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "Assume $P(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)Q(x)+Ax+B$. Then what is $R(x)$?", "subanswer": {"text": "We know that $$\\begin{aligned} R(x)&=(x-1)(x-4)\\left(\\frac{A}{(x-1)(x-4)}+\\frac{B}{(x-4)}+\\frac{C}{(x-1)}+D\\right).\\end{aligned}$$But the right hand side must be a polynomial since the left hand side is one. Therefore, we conclude that $D=0$, and thus $$\\begin{aligned} R(x)=&A(x-1)(x-4)+(B+C)x\\\\=&(A(B+C)-4A)x+(AB-4A).\\end{aligned}$$Since we have the other remainder information, let's use it!
