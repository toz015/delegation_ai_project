To do this, we divide 2008 by 30 and get 66.666... (round down to 66). But remember, we've already included the odd multiples of 3 in the previous step. Since each odd multiple of 15 has been double-counted, we need to subtract 66 from 333.

A decimal terminates when it ends in zeros. Therefore, the reciprocal of an odd integer must simplify to a fraction whose denominator has prime factors of either 2 or 5 only. The prime factorization of such denominators is $10^n=2^n5^n$, where n is any nonnegative integer. To see why an odd integer cannot satisfy this condition, note that every odd integer is of the form $m\\cdot k$ where m is an odd number and k is not equal to 0 or 1; therefore, the odd integer $m\\cdot k$ cannot contain just factors of 2 or 5. However, there is a special case when the denominator will still be of the form $2^a * 5^b$. This occurs when the odd number in question is divisible by $3$. For example, let $k = 9$. This can be written as $k = 3^2.$ In this example, the value of n was changed to $2$.
