If $-9 < x < 9,$ then $(x^2 - 81)$ is negative while $(x^2 - 36x)$ is also negative, leading to another contradiction. However, when $x>9$, $(x^2 - 81)$ is positive while $(x^2 - 36x)$ is also positive, making the fraction greater than zero, not less than zero.

From Condition 2, we already know that $x^2 - 81 \\ge 0$, so $x^2 - 81 \\neq 0$. Because the numerator is non-zero and negative when $x^2 - 81 > 0$ (when $x<-9$ or $x>9$), the sign of the fraction is equal to the sign of the denominator. The denominator is zero when $x=18$ or $x=0$. When $x<0$, the denominator is negative; when $0<x<18$, it's positive; when $x>18$, it's negative again. However, we also know that $x\\ne 0$ and $x\\ne 18$ as those make the denominator zero, thus making the fraction undefined. This leaves us with the intervals $x<0$ and $x>18$, both of which make the fraction negative. The solution set is therefore \\boxed{(-\\infty,0)\\cup(18,\\infty)}.
