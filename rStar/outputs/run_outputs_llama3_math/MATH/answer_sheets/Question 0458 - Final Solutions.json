This is impossible, because the prime numbers are distinct. So there isn't a higher prime after a certain prime. But if the students can't be split up into groups of the same size anymore after Wilma and Betty join, that means that the new number of archers has at least the prime factors that the old number didn't (but the other ones), except for the case where that prime was 2, since then the number of students doubled, and we'd want to see whether doubling doesn't give us a new possibility for splitting.
