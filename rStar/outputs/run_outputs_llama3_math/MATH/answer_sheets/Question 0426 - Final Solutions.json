Since condition 1 states that the square and the equilateral triangle have equal perimeters, let $s$ represent the side length of each of the four sides of the square. It follows that the three side lengths of the equilateral triangle are also equal to s, and thus the perimeter of the square is 4s and the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 3s. Because both perimeters are equal according to condition 1, it must be true that 4s=3s. From this equation, we know that the only solution for s that is a positive number is when s = 0, so that cannot be the correct value for s because it does not satisfy any of the other conditions.
