These perpendicular bisectors create a smaller square with a diagonal length equal to the diagonal length of the original rectangle. We claim that the area of this smaller square is half the area of the original square. To see why, note that the diagonals of both squares are parallel. The ratio of corresponding sides of similar shapes is constant, so it follows that the ratio of areas is constant.

This makes sense because a point near the middle of the side would be equidistant to the middle of the side and a nearby corner; likewise, a point in the middle of the rectangle is equidistant to all the corners.
