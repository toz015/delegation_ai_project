To calculate the percentage of male riders on buses that 10th graders take, multiply 0.344 by 100 to get 34.4%. Similarly, the percentage of female riders on buses that 10th graders take is 0.331 * 100 = 33.1%. Then divide .335 by .331 to get 1.0124, meaning the number of male bus riders for 10th graders is greater than 1.35 * the number of female bus riders.

Thus, the tenth graders cannot be our answer. Now let\u2019s look at the ninth graders. Calculating as before, we find that 0.411 * 100 = 41.1%, or 41.1% of ninth graders ride the bus. 0.394 * 100 = 39.4%, or 39.4% of female ninth graders ride the bus.

The ratio between them is .116/ .086 = 1.348, meaning more than 135% of the female riders on the bus are male.
