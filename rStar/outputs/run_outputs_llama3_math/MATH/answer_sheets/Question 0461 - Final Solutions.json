There is no integer such that the number of its divisors is zero. So we can just exclude every nonpositive integer. Next let us analyze the condition \"having more divisors.\" It says that the number of positive divisors of $n$ is greater than the number of positive digits of $n$, so the condition excludes all integers which have the same amount of divisors and digits.
