For a triangle with side lengths $a,b,$ and $c$ to exist, the Triangle Inequality states that the following conditions must hold: $a+b>c$, $b+c>a$, and $c+a>b$. Let's first consider the conditions $x+y>1$ and $xy>1$ because if either condition is violated, we will not have a valid triangle. Solving $x+y>1$ for $y$, we get $y>1-x$, so $y$ must lie above the line $y=1-x$. Also, solving $xy>1$ for $y$, we get $y>\\dfrac{1}{x}$.
