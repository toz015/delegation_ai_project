Given condition 1, we know the original parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ has its vertex at $(h,k)$. By definition of the vertex form of a parabola $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where the value inside each parenthesis is set equal to zero and solved simultaneously to get x and y coordinates. Now substituting our known values for h and k into the equation, we obtain $y=a(x+h)^2+k$. Expanding the right side yields $y=ax^2+2ahx+a(h)^2+k$. Comparing coefficients with the original parabola, we see that $b=2ah$ and $c=a(h)^2+k$. Next, because the new parabola is obtained by reflecting the original one over the line with equation $y=k$, we can take advantage of the fact that any point $(x, k+p)$ has a corresponding point $(x, k-p)$. Thus, if we let $(x', y')=(x, k+y)$, then we see that the old vertex becomes $(x', y'+k)$; however, since we're reflecting over a horizontal line, the $x$-coordinates remain unchanged,", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.

Let $P=(x,y)$ be any point on the original parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$.
