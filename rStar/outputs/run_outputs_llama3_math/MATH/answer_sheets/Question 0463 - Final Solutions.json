The expression in question is $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}.$ We know from Condition 1 that it is defined whenever the denominator $x^2 - 9$ is not equal to 0. Now let's consider Condition 2. According to Hint 1, when is the fraction $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}$ undefined? The fraction is undefined when the denominator equals zero. So, according to Hint 2, we need to solve the equation $x^2 - 9 = 0$ to determine the values of $x$ that make the fraction undefined. The factored form of $x^2-9$ is $(x+3)(x-3),$ so setting it equal to 0 yields $(x+3)(x-3)=0.$ Solving for $x$, we see that $x+3=0$ or $x-3=0,$ so $x=-3$ or $x=3.$ Thus, there are $\\boxed{2}$ different values of $x$ for which the given expression is undefined.
