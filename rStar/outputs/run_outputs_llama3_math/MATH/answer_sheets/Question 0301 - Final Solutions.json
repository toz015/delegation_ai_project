Each loaf costs $2.50. The bakery opens 7 days a week and takes 2 weeks off annually. How much money does it make in a year? ### Response: Let's think step by step. Step 1: First, let's figure out how much money the bakery makes in a day. It sells 480 loaves of bread for $2.50 each, so in one day, it makes $480\\cdot2.50=1200$. Step 2: Next, let's calculate how many days the bakery is open in a year. There are 365 days in a year, but the bakery closes for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, it is open for 365 - 14 = 351 days. Step 3: Now, let's multiply the amount of money the bakery makes in a day ($1200) by the number of days it is open ($351). This will give us the amount of money the bakery makes in a year. $$1200\\times351=\\boxed{420600}$$ dollars.

At each stop, $2$ people get in and $1$ person gets off. Passenger $A$ is the third passenger to board the elevator. Passegners $B$ and $C$ board the elevator first. What is the minimum number of stops the elevator must make to be filled to capacity? Question 6.1: Who boards the elevator first among B,C and A? Answer 6.1: Passengers B and C board the elevator first. The answer is B and C. Question 6.2: After how many stops does passenger A board the elevator? Answer 6.2: Passenger A boards the elevator on the third stop because passengers B and C boarded first. The answer is 3. Question 6.3: On the eleventh stop, how many people are currently in the elevator? Answer 6.3: On the eleventh stop, $2\\times10=20$ people got in, and $10$ people got out, so the number of people left in the elevator is $20-10=10$. The answer is 10. Question 6.4: Now we can answer the question: What is the minimum number of stops the elevator must make to be filled to capacity? Answer 6.4: With ten people remaining on the eleventh stop, the minimum number of stops the elevator must make is eleven. The answer is 11.

Answer 7.2: No, because BD = 3 and CD = 3 but there's no information about AD being equal to the half of BC. The answer is no. Question 7.3: What type of angle is angle BAD?
