Let $x$ be the number of dollars it takes to paint one square inch of brick, and let $y$ be the number of dollars it takes to buy one cubic inch of concrete. From the first piece of information we get the equation $$xy=1.30,$$and from the second piece we get the equation $$64x=6.80.$$Dividing the second equation by the first equation yields $$(64x)/(xy)=6.80/1.30\\implies 64/y=5.23$$So $$y\\approx12.28.$$Now we substitute into our first equation: $$12.28x\\approx1.30$$Therefore, $$x\\approx0.106.$$\nFor a 3-inch cube we need to calculate both its surface area and its volume. Its surface area is $$6(9)=54\\text{ sq. in.},$$so it will cost approximately $54x\\approx 5.74$ dollars to paint.
