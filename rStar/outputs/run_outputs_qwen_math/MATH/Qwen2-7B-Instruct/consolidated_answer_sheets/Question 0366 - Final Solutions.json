It's an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $2$, starting at $1$ and ending at $199$. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \\(a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\), where \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the term number.\n\nSetting up our equation:\n\n\\[199 = 1 + (n - 1)(2)\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[198 = 2(n - 1)\\]\n\\[99 = n - 1\\]\n\\[n = 100\\]\n\nSo, there are 100 terms.\n\n**Step 2:** Use the sum formula for an arithmetic series, \\(S_n = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(n = 100\\), \\(a_1 =", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Given the nature of the sequence provided, where each term increases by 2 starting from 1 up to 199, it forms an arithmetic sequence.\n\nTo identify the pattern directly without calculating every term, notice that all terms in this sequence (when considered individually) are congruent to 1 modulo 7 due to the sequence being composed solely of odd numbers (since an even number plus one yields an odd number).
