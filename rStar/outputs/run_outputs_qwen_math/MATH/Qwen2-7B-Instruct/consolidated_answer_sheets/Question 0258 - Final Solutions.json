You mentioned that you have a ratio of blue marbles to yellow marbles that starts at 4:3. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{Y} = \\frac{4}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis equation tells us how the numbers of blue marbles (B) and yellow marbles (Y) relate to each other before any changes occur. Specifically, for every 4 blue marbles, there are 3 yellow ones.\n\nNext, after adding 5 blue marbles and removing 3 yellow marbles, the new ratio becomes 7:3.
