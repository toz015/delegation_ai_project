Each three-point set has the same probability of being chosen. What is the probability that the points lie on the same straight line?\n\n[asy]\nsize(50);\nfor (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {\nfor (int j=0; j<3; ++j) {\ndot((i,j));};}\n[/asy]", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. There are a total of \\(3 \\times 3 - 3 = 9\\) ways to choose three different points since each row and column has one overlap when you're counting combinations of three points. \n\nWe now count the number of sets of points that form a single line:\n\n1. Vertical lines: We have \\(3\\) vertical lines, so we have \\(3 \\cdot C(3, 3) = 3\\) possibilities.\n   \n2. Horizontal lines: Similarly, we also have \\(3\\) horizontal lines, so again, we have \\(3 \\cdot C(3, 3) = 3\\) possibilities.\n\n3. Diagonal lines: There are two distinct diagonals going through the grid. For each diagonal, \\(C(3, 3)\\) equals \\(1\\). Thus, we have \\(2 \\cdot C(3, 3) = 2\\) possibilities.\n\nAdding up our totals, we have \\(3 + 3 + 2 = 8\\) favorable cases.\n\nTherefore, the probability that any three randomly selected points fall on a single line is \\(8/9\\).\n\nThe answer is: \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\).", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
