The sum of the first $N$ positive odd numbers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is constant. For the first $N$ positive odd numbers, this difference (or common difference) is 2.\n\nFor an arithmetic series, the $n$th term ($a_n$) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \\]\n\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term number.\n\nIn our case, the first term ($a_1$) is $1$, since the first positive odd number is $1$. The common difference ($d$) is also $2$.\n\nGiven this, the $n$th odd number can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + (n - 1) \\cdot 2 \\]\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 2n - 2 \\]\n\\[ a_n = 2n - 1 \\]\n\nThe sum of the first $N$ terms ($S_N$) of an arithmetic", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "sequence can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ S_N = \\frac{N}{2} [2a_1 + (N - 1)d] \\]\n\nwhere $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.
