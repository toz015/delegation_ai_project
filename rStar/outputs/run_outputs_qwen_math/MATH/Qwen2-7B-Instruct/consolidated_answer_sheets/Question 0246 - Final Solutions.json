With enough food for 18 people but only 12 attending, there was an excess of food equivalent to servings for 6 additional people ($18 - 12 = 6$). This means the group effectively had portions intended for a larger group size. To adjust the quantities to properly cater to just the 12 attendees, they didn't need to order any fewer meals; instead, they utilized the existing portion sizes efficiently since there was already sufficient quantity. The hint provided aimed to frame the problem differently, focusing on proportionality rather than adjusting orders downward. However, based on the scenario described initially, simply by serving the 12 friends without changing their meal counts, no additional action regarding ordering was necessary. Hence, despite the proportional insight offered by the second hint, under the literal interpretation asking whether they should've ordered fewer meals, the answer remains:\n\nThey did not need to order fewer meals because there was already enough food for the 12 of them based on what was prepared for 18.
