To calculate the area of the octagon, it might help to break it down into simpler shapes - like triangles and rectangles.

One strategy could involve drawing lines through the centers of some pairs of opposite sides, creating smaller geometric figures, such as triangles or parallelograms.\n\nFor example, imagine drawing a line from each vertex of the longer side segments to its corresponding non-adjacent vertex of the shorter side segments.
