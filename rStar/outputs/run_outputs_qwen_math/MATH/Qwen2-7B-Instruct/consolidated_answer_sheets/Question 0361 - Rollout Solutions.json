For an equilateral triangle inscribed in the parabola $x^2=8y$, let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as $s$. Without loss of generality, suppose the vertex of the parabola that is also a vertex of the equilateral triangle is at the origin $(0,0)$. If one of the other vertices is on the x-axis, it would have coordinates $(\\pm s/2, -s^2/(8*2))=(\\pm s/2, -s^2/16)$.
