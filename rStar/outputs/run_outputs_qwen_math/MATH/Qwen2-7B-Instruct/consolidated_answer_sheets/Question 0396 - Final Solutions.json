Therefore, Gray Area = Overall Square Area (16)-Total Non-gray Area (20)=-4 square inches, which indicates a mistake in calculation or conceptual understanding because negative area doesn't make sense. Revisiting steps, I should clarify: Area of Gray Piece = Overall Square Area (16) - (Area of Triangle ABD + Area of Triangle BCD + Area of Square e) = 16 - (4+4+12) = 16 - 20 = -4 sq inches. This negative sign implies we've subtracted too much, suggesting the correct approach considers the total grey area directly calculated without subtractive steps, leading to reevaluation and confirmation: The original area of the square minus the sum of the areas not part of the gray piece correctly reflects the grey piece's area. The correct area calculation considering the geometric configuration is based on recognizing the specific arrangement of shapes within the larger square and deducing that the gray piece comprises parts of squares ABCD and the whole square 'e', thus recalculating the total gray area without subtraction but directly identifying its contribution: Total Grey Area = Area of Square ABCD (16 sq inches) - (Areas of Triangles ABD & BCD - which together occupy a combined space equivalent to half the square due to their congruency, leaving only half of square ABCD available in those areas, so effectively reducing the counted square area portion by quarter to account for full exclusion of those triangles' areas from the overall gray region consideration) - Area of Square 'e' (12 sq inches). Thus, Correcting the approach for clarity, identifying the direct composition of the grey piece suggests a reassessment aligns with recognizing the geometric layout's implications rather than mathematical subtraction steps leading to a negative area result. Recalibrating to align directly with the visualization and confirming the total gray area through observation reveals its proportionate area relative to square ABCD without misinterpreting subtraction outcomes resulting in a negative area.
