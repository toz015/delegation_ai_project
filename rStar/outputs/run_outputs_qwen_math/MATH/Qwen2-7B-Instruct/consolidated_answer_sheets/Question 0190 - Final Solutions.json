Paul and Jesse both have a 3/6 (or equivalently, 1/2) chance of picking an odd number because half of the first six primes are odd. If both pick odd numbers, their sum will be even. So, the probability of both picking an odd number is \\( (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \\). Similarly, if both pick an even number, their sum will also be even. The probability of both picking an even number is also \\( (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 \\). Therefore, the total probability that their sum is even is the sum of these probabilities: \\( 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 \\). The answer is: 1/2.\n\nGreat job working through those problems!

Remember, a number is even if it can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.\n\nStep 2: Considering the first prime number, 2 - When considering the sums obtained by adding 2 to any other prime number from our list (which includes odd numbers), we notice that regardless of what prime you add 2 to, the resulting sum will always be odd because an odd number plus an even number equals an odd number.\n\nStep 3: Observing patterns with odd prime numbers - All prime numbers except for 2 are odd. When you add two odd numbers together, you get an even number. \n\nStep 4: Conclusion - Given this insight, since the only way to achieve an even sum involves one of the numbers being the prime number 2, and since there are six prime numbers to choose from including 2, out of those six possibilities, exactly half will involve selecting the prime number 2 to create an even sum.
