Let $x$ be the number of questions Frank answered correctly, and $y$ be the number of questions he answered incorrectly. We know:\n\n1. Frank answered 80 questions, so $x + y = 80$.\n2. Each correct answer is worth 5 points, and each incorrect answer deducts 2 points. With 20 unanswered questions, no points were added or deducted for them. So, the equation based on his total score is $5x - 2(80 - x) = 232$.\n\nSolving the second equation first:\n\\[5x - 2(80 - x) = 232\\]\n\\[5x - 160 + 2x = 232\\]\n\\[7x = 392\\]\n\\[x = 56.\\]\n\nTherefore, Frank answered $\\boxed{56}$ questions correctly. The answer is: 56.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
