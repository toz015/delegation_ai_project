For the sum of three consecutive positive integers (n, n+1, n+2) to be a three-digit palindrome less than 220, first recognize that the general form for their sum would be \\(3n + 3\\). The condition that the sum is a palindrome less than 220 narrows our search significantly because the smallest three-digit palindromes fit within this range are 101, 111, ..., up to 191. These are just some examples showing possible values for the sum being less than 220, but not how to determine them exactly. The approach involves identifying potential palindromic sums under 220, which could include 101, 111, 121,..., 191, etc., while recognizing each represents a candidate for the sum of those consecutive numbers. To find the greatest possible value for the largest of the three integers in the set that makes the sum meet these conditions, you'll need to work backward through these palindromic sums. Consider that \\(3n + 3\\) must equal one of the these above palind. Thus. Let for the example and", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
