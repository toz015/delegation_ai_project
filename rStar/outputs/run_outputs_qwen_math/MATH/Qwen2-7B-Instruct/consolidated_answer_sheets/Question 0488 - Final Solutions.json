Using Hint 2 as guidance, let's calculate the original price. We can set up the equation:\n\nSale Price = Original Price * Fraction Represented\n\nWe're solving for the Original Price, so let's rearrange the equation accordingly:\n\nOriginal Price = Sale Price / Fraction Represented\n\nGiven that the Sale Price is $\\$14.40$ and represents $\\frac{2}{5}$ of the Original Price:\n\nOriginal Price = $\\$14.40 / (\\frac{2}{5})$\n\nTo perform this division by a fraction, we multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction:\n\nOriginal Price = $\\$14.40 * \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nNow, calculating the product:\n\nOriginal Price = $\\$14.40 * \\frac{5}{2} = \\$36$\n\nTherefore, the answer is: The original price of the shirt is $\\$36$.
