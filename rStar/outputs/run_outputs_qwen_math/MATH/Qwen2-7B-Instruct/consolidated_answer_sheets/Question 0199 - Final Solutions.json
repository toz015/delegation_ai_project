According to Hint 1, the arithmetic mean of the numbers 7, 2, $x$, and 10 is calculated as the sum of these numbers divided by 4 (since there are 4 numbers). Given that the mean is 9, we represent this relationship as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 + 2 + x + 10}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the numerator first, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{19 + x}{4} = 9\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\[\n19 + x = 36\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 19 from both sides of the equation gives us:\n\n\\[\nx = 36 - 19\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ is $17$.
