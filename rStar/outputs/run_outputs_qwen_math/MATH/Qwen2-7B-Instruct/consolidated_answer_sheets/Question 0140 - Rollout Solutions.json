By definition of the GCD, $d$ divides both $n - 6$ and $n + 7$, so it also divides their difference, which is 13. Thus, $d$ must be a divisor of 13. Now, because $d$ is a divisor of $n+7$, we know that $d$ cannot be larger than $n+7$. However, since $d$ is limited to divisors of 13 and considering $n > 6$, the largest possible value for $d$ is when $d = 13$. If $n=19$, then $\\gcd(19 - 6, 19 + 7) = \\gcd(13, 26) = 13$. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $\\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$ is $\\boxed{13}$. The answer is: 13.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
