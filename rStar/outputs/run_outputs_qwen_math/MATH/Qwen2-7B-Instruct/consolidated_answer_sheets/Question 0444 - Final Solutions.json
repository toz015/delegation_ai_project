This forms smaller rectangles within the original rectangle where any point located in those smaller rectangles meets our criteria.\n\n2. **Dividing into Halves**: Imagine drawing lines through the diagonals of the original rectangle.

Since the problem specifies a single smaller quarter is enough to meet our criteria (one in each quadrant), focusing on one triangle simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n3. **Area Proportions**: Each of these 'center-point' areas is half the area of a triangle formed by joining adjacent vertices with the center of the rectangle ($O$).", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 9}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Rectangle $ABCD$ has center $O$ and $AB/AD=k$.
