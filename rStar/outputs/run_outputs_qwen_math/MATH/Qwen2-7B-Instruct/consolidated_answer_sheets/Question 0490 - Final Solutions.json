Consider the following combination of factors:\n\n\\[66 = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 11.\\]\nWe need five factors because the polynomial degree is likely high (equal to the number of roots). One way to balance them out is by selecting some directly as roots and using the rest to form a set of paired products that might cancel each other out partially. \n\nOne simple approach is to choose four smaller factors and the largest one (to make sure all are distinct). Four factors (including repetition): \\(1, 1, 2, 3\\). These would contribute \\(1+1+2+3=7\\) when summed. The fifth factor, \\(11\\), would multiply these sums together. However, since it multiplies without contributing to the sum, we essentially just use the four factors for direct contribution to the sum part of Vieta's formula.\n\nNow, \\(a_{n-1}\\) represents the negative sum of the roots.
