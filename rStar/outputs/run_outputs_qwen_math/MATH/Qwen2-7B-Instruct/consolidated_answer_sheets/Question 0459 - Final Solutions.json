For a 1-inch cube, the volume is \\(1^3=1\\) cubic inch, and for a 2-inch cube, the volume is \\(2^3=8\\) cubic inches. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of a 1-inch cube to a 2-inch cube is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{Volume\\ of\\ 1-inch\\ cube}{Volume\\ of\\ 2-inch\\ cube} = \\frac{1}{8}. \\]\n\nSo, the ratio of the volumes is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n**Answer:** The ratio of the volumes of a 1-inch cube to a 2-inch cube is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.\\)\n\nThe answer is: \\frac{1}{8}.", "value": 1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find the cost of a 3-inch cube based on the provided information, first recognize the relationship between the cost structure and the dimensions involved. It seems initially that each subsequent increase in the dimension leads to a higher cost due to both the volume (costly concrete) and the surface area (costly paint) scaling differently. However, this problem requires understanding the specific cost relationship\u2014cost being proportional to surface area for painting but not directly to volume, yet influenced by it through material used (concrete here).\n\nGiven the cost relationship suggests direct proportionality (since increasing size affects both volume and surface area), one could deduce costs follow geometric progression (geometrically increasing as size increases cubically for volume and linearly or more likely linearly adjusted for surface area). \n\nGiven:\n\n- A 1\" cube cost = \\$1.30\n- A 2\" cube cost = \\$6.80\n\nWe're asked to find the cost of a 3\" cube using the logic provided in hints and steps.\n\nFirst, note the cost ratios seem to indicate either a simple price-to-size scaling issue or an exponential pattern in cost increase related to size.
