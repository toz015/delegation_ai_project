Given it's an isosceles right triangle, both the base and height are equal to half the length of the hypotenuse because those sides would be our base and height measurements when using the altitude as our height measurement.\n\nGiven the hypotenuse \\( H \\) is 8, the base and height each would therefore be \\( \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\).\n\nUsing the area formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8 \\].\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is \\( \\boxed{8} \\).
